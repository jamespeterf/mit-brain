1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,400
so hi everyone welcome back to the crash

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,480
course lecture series for the autoimmune

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,840
disease machine learning challenge in

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,639
this lecture we're going to cover uh the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
data that you'll be working with during

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,080
the three crunches uh how the data is

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,680
organized uh and then what are the

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,240
actual crunches what are the actual

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,279
tasks that you're going to be working on

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,920
with these data sets so first I'd like

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,920
to give you uh a really brief recap of

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,840
the first two lectures before we go into

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,640
the data so in the first lecture you got

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,399
an introduction to autoimmune disease

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,160
and you learned about ulcerative colitis

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,600
and how Pathologists study ulcerative

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,000
colitis tissue by doing these h& e

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
stains and here again we have this

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,960
comparison between healthy colon where

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,640
you have these nice ordered Crypts and

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,399
aler of kitis where you're seeing this

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,920
inflammation and really massive changes

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
in the tissue structure and organization

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,440
so you know this is really great

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,079
Pathologists can learn a lot from these

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,760
images but in the challenge or these

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,480
crunches we really want to move beyond

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,399
that

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,920
and then we also want to ask can we use

30
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,119
these images to inform uh predictions

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,560
about uh the development of cancer in

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
these

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,000
patients the second lecture we cover the

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,159
technologies that are used to measure

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,960
gene expression programs so you remember

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,119
the gene expression programs are groups

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,040
of genes that are turned on and

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,040
regulated together during a biological

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,920
process and they dramatically change

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,000
from Health to disease so from Health to

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,640
ulcerative colitis or from healthy colon

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,880
to colar rectal cancer

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,200
and then we've also introduced three

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,479
different Technologies to profile these

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
colon tissues they're these h& stains

46
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,720
the Pathologists use and then there's

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,479
the spatial transcriptomics measurements

48
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,399
where we can profile hundreds of genes

49
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,880
at a time while maintaining spatial

50
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,759
information and then there are these

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,680
single cell RNA seek or single cell

52
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,880
transcriptomics measurements where we're

53
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,920
measuring thousands of single cells and

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,119
getting gene expression for all 20,000

55
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,000
genes but we lose the spatial

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,399
information okay so that's a brief recap

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,479
of what you've already seen and now

58
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,280
let's go into what data you're going to

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,280
be working with so we'll talk about the

60
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,319
clinical samples that we're working with

61
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,080
and the data that's derived from them

62
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,920
from them and then finally we'll go into

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,080
the three different

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,840
crunches so first the clinical samples

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,800
so the collection of the clinical

66
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,280
samples uh from ulcerative colitis

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
patients was spearheaded by uh Dr Ron

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
mavier who again is one of the

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,519
organizers of this of this Challenge and

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,800
also uh with help from Dr Angela shei

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,519
who is a pathologist at Harvard Medical

72
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,760
School and Massachusetts General

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,920
Hospital and they collected eight tissue

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,440
samples from patients with colon

75
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,400
inflammation so here we're showing again

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,760
non-inflamed colon and inflamed colon

77
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,000
this is the view from a

78
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,640
colonoscopy and most of the samples

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,360
you're going to be working with are from

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,760
ulcerative colitis uh and we have pieces

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,560
of the tissue that are both from

82
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,239
inflamed and non-inflamed regions we

83
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,080
also have a few samples from a more mild

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,760
form of inflammation called

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,799
diverticulitis um we provide these

86
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,080
samples because there's less change to

87
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,239
the colon spatial organization in

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,959
diverticulitis so this is a good thing

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,640
to compare to when you want to think

90
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,040
about what healthy colon looks like

91
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,080
versus what inflamed or heavily inflamed

92
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,920
colon looks like in ulcerative colitis

93
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
so this is a good point of reference

94
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,319
when looking at the changes in spatial

95
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,439
organization as inflammation

96
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,920
increases so each tissue sample was

97
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,840
prepared by uh a group of doctors and

98
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,000
Pathologists for uh processing an h&

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,920
image and also collecting spal

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
transcriptomic data and for each tissue

101
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,319
uh our pathologist Angela shei um looked

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,360
at uh the tissue and the h& stain and

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,439
diagnosed the disease type and how

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,120
severe it is and also looked for

105
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,439
evidence of dysplasia which you'll

106
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,799
remember is a sign of precancer it's

107
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,400
these early abnormal growths in the

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,519
epithelial

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,760
cells so here is the tissue processing

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,519
pipeline uh that each of these samples

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,000
went through uh the this is work that

112
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,720
was done at the Bro Institute by Osa

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,879
seopa and crystalin and what they did

114
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,239
was they take the colon tissue that's

115
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,959
been taken out of the patient and they

116
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,040
chop it up and they identify the

117
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,840
different layers of the tissue then they

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,440
embed the tissue in paraffin paraffin is

119
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,600
a rigid substrate it's like Wax and once

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,520
the tissue is embedded in this wax you

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,080
can make very very thin slices 5 Micron

122
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,280
width and that's ideal for microscopy

123
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,800
and imaging so you make these uh

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,880
paraffin blocks you make these very thin

125
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,840
sections as you see here and then you

126
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,479
can stain those very thin sections of

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,600
the colon tissue with the h& stain and

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,400
Angela the pathologist come look at it

129
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,360
and start to annotate the image and tell

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,039
us uh what's happening from the

131
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,400
histopathology

132
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,880
perspective so here are the first four

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,479
of the eight samples you'll be working

134
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,560
with these are the h& images of ulcer

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,520
colitis samples an inflamed piece from

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
patient one and a non-inflamed piece

137
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,720
from patient one in addition to

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,840
diverticulitis samples which look a lot

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
more normal in terms of the colon tissue

140
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,960
organization you see clearly all the

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,840
layers and not really evidence of uh bad

142
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,919
inflammation and then here's the next

143
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,120
four tissue sections you work with um

144
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,160
these are all ulcerative colitis uh

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,960
patients an inflamed then a non-inflamed

146
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,720
piece and then two other inflamed pieces

147
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,440
and then uh importantly uh when Dr

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,080
Angela shei was looking at this sample

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,120
uh she spotted that this patient has

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,080
dysplasia which again is a mark of

151
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,080
precancer so let's look at that h& stain

152
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,759
a little more closely um so just to

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,560
remind you uh there's a Continuum of

154
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,680
cancer where we go from normal colon

155
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,759
mucosa to dysplasia which is these

156
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,880
abnormal growth of epithelial cells all

157
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,800
the way to carcino which is the coloral

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,560
cancer and so here's the h& image of

159
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,759
that patient uh col tissue that was

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,000
taken out and Angela noted that this

161
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,919
region of the mucosa that's darker has

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,479
displasia and this region that's a

163
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,440
little lighter and looks more a little

164
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,520
more normal and ordered is non-cancerous

165
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,720
so this was very interesting to us

166
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,400
because we wanted to know you know

167
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,280
what's different between these regions

168
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,680
and can we learn more about the regions

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,720
with displasia and better identify them

170
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,479
from pathology images and on the right

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
here we have some of the notes that Dr

172
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,039
shei made about that image but the most

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,520
important thing is that was remarked was

174
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,039
that there's this low grade dysplasia in

175
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,840
this region

176
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,400
here so that's an overview of the tissue

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
uh the clinical tissue samples you'll be

178
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,479
working with and now we will discuss uh

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,479
the data that's derived from those

180
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,479
samples
