1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,160
ocw is definitely something which I

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,400
would identify as like an extra work

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,759
which I had taken for myself because I

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,599
want to think differently I want I I

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
always sort of had this um repulsion

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,240
against group thing repulsion are very

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,960
quite strong words so I'll just say very

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,720
very cautious probably because I follow

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,119
the market every day and I Tred to be

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,480
very very cautious about group think

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,850
well how can I think different how can I

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,880
think logically

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,680
[Music]

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,480
welcome to open Learners a podcast that

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,879
tells the stories of Learners all over

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,559
the world who use mit's open courseware

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,239
I'm Emmanuel Li kasigi an open learner

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,960
myself from campala Uganda in East

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,199
Africa and I'm Michael Jordan pilra an

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,199
open learner from Memphis

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,399
Tennessee we're back episode two Michael

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,000
hey Emanuel uh do you want to introduce

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
today's open lner today we will hear

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,360
from J mean Hong an open learner

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,880
currently living in Soul South Korea I

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,799
met J mean about two years ago after my

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,040
MIT news article came out she reached

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,600
out to me via LinkedIn and I got on a

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,360
zoom call with her for about an hour

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,000
while she was studying at the University

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,479
of Wisconsin well for me this interview

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,600
was the first time I met J me face to

33
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,000
face but we're actually in the same AI

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
study group on ledin which is

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,880
interesting so it was really cool for

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,600
both of us to put faces to our names

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,320
that's awesome Emanuel I know you

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,200
started the AI learning group on

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,600
LinkedIn and you were really excited to

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,560
start building a community of AI

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,640
Learners all over the world one reason

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,479
we really wanted to interview jam mean

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,479
for open Learners was because her

44
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,759
educational path is so unique one she

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,600
started her open course s Journey as an

46
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,840
undergrad student with a course in

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,240
thermodynamics to supplement her dual

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,680
degree program in chemistry and finance

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,360
and two Jam has lived and learned all

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,599
over the world she left Korea at 14 to

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
attend high school in New Zealand and

52
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,640
she attended the University of Wisconsin

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,680
for a year in the middle of the pandemic

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,560
before returning to Korea to finish her

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,440
economic degree that's really cool Jam

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,360
is really he a really driven person

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,400
because most people don't usually start

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,200
these paths during their underground but

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,120
she did and she shared with us her

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,440
perspective on how education defers

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,560
around the world her ocw gave her new

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,519
ways of thinking about herself and her

63
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,400
career path which is really interesting

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
and I'm excited to hear all about that

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,680
so let's get to it here is our

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,680
conversation with Jam Hong of Soul South

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Korea

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:52,290
[Music]

69
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,599
hi my name is Jamon Hong and I'm a final

70
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:12,360
year economics student studying um at

71
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,959
yon University and I was born and raised

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,840
in Korea for the most part of my life

73
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,400
but I also had some very exciting

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,239
Journeys in America and New Zealand late

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,040
2022 so I finished the first semester of

76
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,480
my sophomore year but then that was

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,560
still when covid was still around and

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,720
all the campus lectures they were all

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,439
shut down so all the classes were done

80
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,599
online but then as a very social and

81
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,120
active human interaction driven person I

82
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,680
wanted to go out there but there was no

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,879
chance of having any campus lectur so I

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,599
went to

85
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,720
America I went to America where inperson

86
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,079
lectures were um permitted and I went to

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,319
W Madison and then this was the time

88
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,760
when I was trying to explore more

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,640
subjects and yeah really establish my

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
perspective of the world and how I would

91
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,720
like to apply this this the knowledge

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,439
that I really wanted to learn while

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,599
while I was at University I was studying

94
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,759
chemistry when I was at W Madison which

95
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,840
is up north very very cold but I studied

96
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,720
chemistry Finance data science and

97
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,600
computer science all sorts of subjects

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,440
there but chemistry was very exciting

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,039
but challenging so I was sort of trying

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,639
to seek out and gather around more

101
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,440
information so that I can improve my

102
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,280
understanding and I and then I came

103
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,720
across

104
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,039
mitw videos and then the first course

105
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,919
that I took was called thermodynamics

106
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,880
and kinetics and this was the most

107
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,520
difficult subject within chemistry but I

108
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,400
loved it how was it like like first of

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,240
all meeting all these online resources

110
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,240
maybe compared to your former education

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
experiences from New Zealand from South

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,960
Korea how was the difference when you

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,080
finally met ocw and MIT and uh how is it

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,560
for you

115
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,400
personally well I think the major

116
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,280
difference was about flexibility because

117
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,960
when you're taking a lecture and you're

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,759
in a lecture hall filled with 300

119
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,560
different students you cannot just sort

120
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,080
of actively try to find out information

121
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,280
or like areas of interest you can you

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,360
can't directly ask the professor but

123
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,680
then or

124
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
rewind it's a bit difficult to do that

125
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,360
and so because I'm I'm quite a proactive

126
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
learner and so I want to find out more

127
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,720
information for myself but with a more

128
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,639
structured learning program that is more

129
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,080
conventionally offered at universities

130
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,360
was quite difficult to do and so with

131
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,720
MIT ocw I was able to sometimes pick out

132
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,080
topics that that Drew me the most and

133
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,800
that was entropy for me thermodynamics

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,840
and then I wanted to learn more about

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,919
that instead of you know just trying to

136
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,960
rely on very structured course learning

137
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,440
at um conventional you know traditional

138
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,199
University Systems Mark Twain once

139
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,880
famously said that I never let my school

140
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,639
institutional learning interfere with my

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,520
education and that is the sort of phrase

142
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,960
that swept me away at that time this is

143
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,800
education like this is what learning

144
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,639
actually means I was going to ask a

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,000
quick question here when you have this

146
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
breakthrough moment when you start

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,800
actually learning from open educ

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,639
materials and not you know waiting for a

149
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,039
teacher to prod you like what did it

150
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,840
change in your life the first change is

151
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
that okay like I'm actually learning

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,000
this so in terms of the finance Theory

153
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,160
which I know you also took as part of

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,240
your MIT ocw Journey when I was taking

155
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,520
the finance Theory course taught by

156
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,560
Professor Andrew low I was taking a more

157
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,400
or less equivalent course at W Madison

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,400
it was called money and Market we were

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,720
learning about the impact of monetary

160
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,599
policies conducted by Federal Reserve

161
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,400
but then what was really interesting was

162
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,560
that in this course Finance the the MIT

163
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,039
ocw course this was actually filmed when

164
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,919
G um when GFC the global financial

165
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,879
crisis was happening and so it was more

166
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,599
like I'm actually learning about these

167
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,759
theories but I'm actually also seeing

168
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,560
how these theories were like happening

169
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,599
in real life and how they actually apply

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,960
to R scenarios like fixed income

171
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,840
security products went a bit too complex

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,560
and the leverage ratio went a bit crazy

173
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,319
these were the sort of knowledge that I

174
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,479
was learning theoretically at University

175
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,039
and sure I was like watching videos and

176
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,440
learning theoretically but then actually

177
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,240
I was able to see the real impact of it

178
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,639
like through the video that was actually

179
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,159
recorded at the time of GFC and so it

180
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,199
was more like a reward for my proactive

181
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,919
learning because it was genuinely quite

182
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,240
interesting and yeah I was able to draw

183
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:08,000
parallels in many different angles and

184
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,000
it was yeah it make my life more

185
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,120
fun I like when you mentioned it was

186
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:19,159
like in real time I experienced that CU

187
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:22,479
I took the computer science courses 61

188
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:26,000
and 62 and also what stood out for me

189
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,720
was the time they recorded those was the

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,960
time I was in university so it was like

191
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
I was in

192
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,159
learning some other things and these

193
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,800
people are learning like these things

194
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,039
like we on the same timeline if I'm

195
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,440
remember to meet those people in the

196
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,159
class in the real world like oh we're in

197
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,959
University at the same time but it felt

198
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,959
like we're learning like two different

199
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,440
things yes you're both learning computer

200
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,040
science related things but it's like a

201
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,160
different difference so I understand you

202
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,279
on that you mentioned something about

203
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,560
you know the need to find people moving

204
00:08:52,279 --> 00:09:01,040
the US and finding

205
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:04,720
ocw was the impact more in like you and

206
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,000
yourself and identity as a person when

207
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,120
you start taking ocw you mention you've

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,959
taken Finance Theory thermodynamics how

209
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,160
was the impact in your evolving identity

210
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,440
how did you start to see yourself as a

211
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,240
person who now has all this knowledge

212
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,399
did it have any real life applications

213
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,880
or any real life effects or impact when

214
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
you studying these

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,000
things maybe you could shed some light

216
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
on that yeah that's such an excellent

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,440
question because I genuinely feel that

218
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,040
I'm more like an

219
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,959
Explorer I'm never satisfied with just

220
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,800
like one path I have to just like look

221
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,200
around and they okay like this is some

222
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,040
this is something else which I can

223
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,640
integrate with this past or this might

224
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,120
be some other Branch from this past with

225
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,959
which I'm trotting upon while I was

226
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,480
listening to your question I actually

227
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,959
had something that I wanted to ask you

228
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,959
Emanual if that's right you said that

229
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,160
you were taking the ocw courses while

230
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,480
you were at University am I correct no I

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,279
I took

232
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:09,360
them I took them in 2020

233
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:13,320
2021 but the courses were recorded in

234
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,440
2020 is it 2013 2011 2013 and that was

235
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,519
the time I was in university so they

236
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,399
recorded their courses while I was also

237
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,480
in University I watched them like way

238
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,760
later right that's so cool so I was

239
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,560
wondering what your major was and like

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,720
what your favorite course of ocw was and

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,120
like how you came came across ocw like

242
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,440
basically like your story too I was

243
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,680
actually about to ask you the same

244
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,240
question about how you came across ocw

245
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,880
so I like this um my major was also

246
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,480
actually in computer science but

247
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,519
Information Systems it was a new course

248
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
in the country I think they only did

249
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,240
like three years of it then they

250
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
absorbed it back into the information

251
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,360
technology course so I've been in this

252
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,160
computer science world for a while

253
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,040
started out front end didn't like it I

254
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,360
went to more graphics design so I

255
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,639
discovered ocw in lockdown when I wanted

256
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:09,839
now to learn backend I went to Dubai and

257
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:11,800
saw they had a World Expo so most of the

258
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,240
Pavilions most of the countries were

259
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,560
showcasing things to do with ai ai so I

260
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,480
was I realized this is the future it's

261
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,800
coming this was like in 2020 so when I

262
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,000
came back home I wanted to look up you

263
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,519
know to learn more about a I get into

264
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the backend and that's how I came across

265
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
ocw

266
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,880
actually how did you come across W I was

267
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
on YouTube actually cuz I've been doing

268
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,920
a lot of YouTube learning for like 10

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,079
years now yeah um so my first

270
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,480
convergence with ocw was through that

271
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,000
course that I talked about the

272
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,079
thermodynamics and kinetics course I was

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,639
just trying to search up what video

274
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,880
lectures I was seeking for lectures not

275
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,000
like 10 minutes explanation video I did

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,440
not want that although condensed

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,279
explanation on summary videos they help

278
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
but when you're actually trying to ro

279
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,480
really understand and absorb the

280
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,240
material and topic or um studies which

281
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,079
you're interested in 10 minutes can

282
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,560
never satisfy you and it never answers

283
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,360
your question you often have to do

284
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,600
additional yeah searching and then you

285
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,639
actually have to do okay which textbook

286
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,959
or like materials are they basing their

287
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,639
argument upon like I'm sort of like this

288
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,880
fact Checker and so if I watch a video I

289
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,120
first of all check the profile of that

290
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
person who's explaining okay this this

291
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,399
is this person that qualified to teach

292
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,920
me this and so you never you never ask

293
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,959
those questions when it comes to MIT

294
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,800
course materials and so yeah so it

295
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
ticked off every box on my

296
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,959
checklist I'm kind of interested in the

297
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,240
impact it had you know in your life

298
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:54,199
outside of your academic studies what do

299
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,440
your friends think do you share with

300
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,199
your friends this open course where

301
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,720
Journey what did your family think and

302
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,199
you know did it Ripple into your

303
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,279
community as well or yeah I think I

304
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,880
would have actively shared these

305
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,920
materials MIT ocw materials with my

306
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,560
friends um if they spoke

307
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,720
English but yeah I

308
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,760
think yeah I do have um friends who are

309
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,279
living in America and they are Americans

310
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,160
cuz you've lived in like several

311
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:27,320
countries how was that yeah definitely

312
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,560
um my lifestyle has been quite

313
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,440
paretic I've basically been being like a

314
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,800
nomad my mom is an English teacher half

315
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,440
of my mom's family so my aunties and my

316
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,560
uncles they all live in America and yeah

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,959
we've got quite mixed family backgrounds

318
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,040
happening on my mom's side my dad's

319
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:48,240
side's very much yeah rooted in Korea so

320
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,800
it's quite an interesting um family and

321
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,839
cultural Dynamic so then this sort of

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,880
epiphany did not really click through

323
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,680
until I entered middle school so when I

324
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,480
became School junior I realized that I

325
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,839
just did not want to stick with this

326
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,560
very regimented school system that is

327
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,600
very much prominent in Korea so my

328
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,199
parents also shared the same view they

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,759
wanted me to explore the wider pool um

330
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,839
overseas they so I moved to New Zealand

331
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,320
when I was 14 and I had no one there I

332
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,880
had no family relations so spent my

333
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,519
Junior and senior years there so middle

334
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,279
school high school and then I was going

335
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,519
to take my tertiary ation in London

336
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,600
there's a universal University College

337
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,120
London I was going to study economics

338
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,399
there but then that was also the year

339
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,079
when covid broke out and I couldn't pay

340
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,279
like a million dollars

341
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,480
for for for this education which I had

342
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,240
no real access to and so I quickly

343
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,759
changed my plan came back to Korea but I

344
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,560
always had this yearning for broader

345
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,240
learning something else that I can do

346
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,720
okay like I'm working on this but what

347
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,560
else can I do more

348
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,000
amazing you moved to New Zealand at 14

349
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,240
when you knew no one that's

350
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,759
courageous on the same point we can

351
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,759
highlight how was the difference in

352
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,160
traditional learnings I going to call

353
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,920
them several CU you've taken classes

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,880
from different countries how was the

355
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,199
difference in those places traditional

356
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,759
learnings versus open

357
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:29,920
learning I'd say that they're both

358
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,880
strengths and sometimes a bit weaknesses

359
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,040
so strengths when it comes to

360
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,360
Conventional education the main strength

361
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,199
I would say is that you're able to

362
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,360
directly interact with professors and

363
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,040
ask questions to Tas if you have them

364
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,079
when it comes to open learning although

365
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,920
you're able to really search out for

366
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,839
information and dig out those extra

367
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,040
learning materials that you wanted for

368
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
yourself um let's say you've got your

369
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,680
answer sheet and then the quiz materials

370
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,360
the quiz um question sheet you're able

371
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,120
to check that you've got this question

372
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,199
wrong but sometimes when you trip over

373
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,399
to this question and not able to really

374
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,920
figure out what's like why I have gotten

375
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,199
this question wrong I I needed some

376
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,240
external help and so I would be asking

377
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:13,040
my friends whose major is chemistry and

378
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,639
then they would help me um in in that

379
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,079
but then there's sort of like this Cross

380
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,880
transation of what I am learning here

381
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,680
and then they are trying to figure out

382
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,800
put their fingers on what what is this

383
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,920
context like why are you doing this and

384
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,600
then I often find myself having to

385
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,000
explain oh I'm actually an economics

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,839
student just interested in chemist CH

387
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,720
istry and so like learning about this

388
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,240
and then they are trying to diagnose my

389
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,519
prior knowledge in chemistry and then

390
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,959
they realize that okay you should

391
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,160
probably like start with this and this

392
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,759
and this and so sort of like that

393
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,440
structured guidance it might become a

394
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,199
sort of impediment in some way um when

395
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,240
it comes to Conventional traditional

396
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,720
education system but it also works

397
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,519
enormously well for students who aren't

398
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,079
quite sure like where they're lost in

399
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,920
but um but also at the same time um as

400
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,800
I've mentioned the flexibility comes in

401
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,839
just just very very encouraging and it's

402
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,000
it's it's highly invigorating if you're

403
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,760
if you feel if you derive satisfaction

404
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,640
from taking on the initiative and then

405
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,679
actually executing those initiatives if

406
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,760
you're like very action taker like me so

407
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,600
I just did not want to form a plan okay

408
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,120
I want to learn more about chemistry but

409
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,400
then I'll just put that aside for a week

410
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,520
or so but then if you actually want to

411
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,200
get down to it immediately and then seek

412
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,720
out an all available resource which you

413
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,960
can learn more about than like ocw is

414
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,799
definitely a cutout like

415
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,760
prototype you talk about self-learning

416
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,720
you know a lot of people think of

417
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,919
self-learning as you know running a

418
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,799
marathon like they think it's the same

419
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:53,280
thing right like that's just this

420
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,240
impossible task but but oddly enough you

421
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,080
know you you talk about it and you're

422
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,559
like I'm invigorated I'm inspired to do

423
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,120
more I I think bigger you know what are

424
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,360
some ways maybe even now like entering

425
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,919
your last last year of University what

426
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,880
are you thinking about like what does

427
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,919
your Mor look like now I think this goes

428
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,159
back to the cultural background so sort

429
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,799
of like the sort of Mantra that I grew

430
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:23,360
up with so you mentioned that I try to

431
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,960
think bigger and like expand what I have

432
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,039
right now and I think that comes from my

433
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,679
background where I was constantly

434
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:34,480
shuffling between America um Korea and

435
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,200
then New Zealand and because I know that

436
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,840
your degree was poetry and my favorite

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,840
poet was Emily Dickinson she wrote this

438
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,480
um really famous verse called I'm like a

439
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,280
flower that cannot take its roots

440
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,799
anywhere and that was the sort of thing

441
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,320
that I was feeling for myself but I

442
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,840
tried to translate that into my own

443
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Advantage I attend y University but I

444
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,480
don't always follow the crowd I always

445
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,520
think about what can I do differently so

446
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,919
actually like I'm trying to enter

447
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,559
Investment Banking right now and then

448
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,760
there is a group of University clubs and

449
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,799
societies where they are working

450
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,600
Investment Banking entry roles by doing

451
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,280
case studies together and then getting

452
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,760
feedback with the ultimate goal being

453
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,039
trying to get a place at an investment

454
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,080
Bank in Korea but then when I look at

455
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,919
them like they all qualified to apply

456
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,559
for a role in like basically like Wall

457
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,520
Street they're so talented but then they

458
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,159
never sort of think outsides their

459
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,039
institution and then think okay if I if

460
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,919
I sort of Leverage this resource let's

461
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,360
say this external resource communities

462
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
like 100 women in finance I'll be able

463
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,720
to probably reach out to different

464
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,640
people and then um put my paws on that

465
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,840
opportunity as well and so just sort of

466
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,400
like reaching out for different

467
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,840
opportunities and seeing what I can do

468
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,159
differently is basically something that

469
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,159
shapes me and has been this sort of

470
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,679
identified of me and ocw is definitely

471
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,840
something which I would identify as like

472
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,760
an extra work which I had taken for

473
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,720
myself because I want to think

474
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,799
differently I always sort of had this

475
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
repulsion against group thing repulsion

476
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,200
is a very quite strong word so I'll just

477
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,960
say very very cautious probably because

478
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,120
I follow the market every day and I

479
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,760
tried to very very cautious about this

480
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,039
group think how can I think logically

481
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,640
it's very very long response sorry like

482
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,559
yeah it was a big question it was you

483
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,120
know you could go anywhere with it um

484
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,600
the director of MIT open course where

485
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,000
Curt Newton this is a question from him

486
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,200
you know when you think about the impact

487
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
of open educational resources that

488
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,919
they've had on your life and people that

489
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,120
you know when you look into the future

490
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,559
with all the newly acquired knowledge

491
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,240
you have is is there anything that if

492
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:07,320
you had a magic wand that you would want

493
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,720
for a free open educational resource

494
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,039
available for the world can I be very

495
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,480
very specific because I was I I'm in

496
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,039
preparation for certain as I've said I'm

497
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,320
preparing to become like um investment

498
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,600
banker um um as like my um entry role in

499
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,640
my career in my very early career stage

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,159
and then I was trying to seek out for

501
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,240
MIT ocw courses that are relate to this

502
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,279
subject but I had somewhat difficulty

503
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,960
finding it and the subject is

504
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:40,039
accounting I realized that MCW um

505
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,039
actually has phenomenal finance-based

506
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:44,039
courses but then when it comes to

507
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,960
accounting I had some difficulties

508
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:49,520
trying to find related resources and so

509
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,400
that is very very specific answer mean

510
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,860
what happens when you finish all those

511
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,480
accounting

512
00:21:52,860 --> 00:22:00,080
[Laughter]

513
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,000
courses what's next what's next

514
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,799
but you

515
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,360
know every open learner we've talked to

516
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,440
so far has said the same exact answer

517
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,960
which is like more courses yeah it's

518
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,200
it's kind of weird

519
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,360
actually more courses maybe I'll ask you

520
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,760
something extra because I'm seeing

521
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,360
you've taken mainly accounting and

522
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,919
economics and finance related coures

523
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,039
have you taken anything outside like

524
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,039
those fields anything outside accounting

525
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,480
and economics on ocw um yeah that's

526
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,279
that's another great question so the

527
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,520
courses I sort of like dabbled in many

528
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,120
different courses as in there were some

529
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,039
courses which I did not watch to their

530
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,520
full length but then there were some

531
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,320
courses where I just sort of like

532
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,679
watched one or two videos on the

533
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,520
playlist and the reason being I was

534
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,640
often finding myself in a quite

535
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,200
difficult time management situation and

536
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,200
so I was trying to maximize the

537
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,559
efficiency of learning by watching the

538
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,320
videos that are most relevant to the

539
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,279
questions that I have inside my head or

540
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,120
the difficulties that I'm facing at my

541
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,440
like actual University the courses that

542
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,360
I've taken so chemistry the thermod

543
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,919
Dynamics and connectic one and I've also

544
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,840
taken of course Professor Gilbert

545
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,559
strang's linear algebra course which has

546
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,000
come in very very handy when I was

547
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:21,880
studying convolutional neural

548
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,799
networks um I was I was going to say we

549
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,679
need to come back to gilver

550
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,440
strange yeah we deserve yeah a whole

551
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,720
separate conversation like what a legend

552
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,720
what brings you back to your career I

553
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,919
know you're in University now like has

554
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,320
this always been a drive for you or is

555
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,159
it just in University you're feeling the

556
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,279
pressure now that like I got to figure

557
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,120
out what I'm going to do to make money

558
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,760
you know after this or what what are you

559
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,120
thinking very very

560
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,120
realistically half and half of each so

561
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,559
half being I generally enjoy learning

562
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,559
and so there was absolutely no reason

563
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,640
just no modom reason for me to take

564
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,400
chemistry courses but I took it because

565
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,000
I really enjoyed it chemistry learning

566
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,000
chemistry really pushed forwards my

567
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,760
drive to learn more and then expands my

568
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,200
Horizon like you have rightly pointed

569
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,919
out I'm also a final year student and I

570
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,400
think I have dabbled in all the areas

571
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,679
which drew me in so like chemistry

572
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,440
Finance data science and then economics

573
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:31,360
I tried them all and now I think it's

574
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,200
probably the time where I have to yes

575
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,000
basically root myself in specific

576
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,200
grounds and then even if they don't work

577
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,760
out you know they say like it doesn't

578
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,159
matter in 5

579
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,200
years probably I can like change my

580
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,080
career plan after 5 years but as of the

581
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,480
moment I'm trying to solidify and

582
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,720
consolidate one specific goal and really

583
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,440
gear towards that goal so using all the

584
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,799
resources and the learnings that I've

585
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,840
had to achieve a specific goal you know

586
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,120
me in my journey too like when you get a

587
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,240
specific goal you can always line up

588
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,919
another one you can always make another

589
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,120
one you can always change that's your

590
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,159
right as a human being right completely

591
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,799
agree with you yeah this has been

592
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,960
amazing uh I just have one more thing

593
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,000
maybe to ask you're an amazing character

594
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,000
you've gone from Finance to sances to

595
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,720
fch you're now in Investment Banking

596
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,440
amazing amazing journey any advice for

597
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,000
anyone listen listening who may want to

598
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,399
take your path or maybe learn a few

599
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,760
things from you for future ocw Learners

600
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:41,559
or listeners to this podcast I would say

601
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,159
that my path up to this point has been

602
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,120
incredibly

603
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:50,080
unpredictable but I always tried to

604
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:54,600
follow what I'm interested in and being

605
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:58,720
able to search the resources I'm wanting

606
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,559
to learn more for your advantage these

607
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,240
are like very very important qualities

608
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,880
that will eventually lead you up to a

609
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,080
certain point and for me that is

610
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
investment banking at this point I'm not

611
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,840
sure if what what I will say after like

612
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,480
five years but that is my current career

613
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,880
goal the 5-year plan and up to this

614
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,240
point there's been so many different

615
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,120
Explorations where I went from economics

616
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,600
chemistry Finance fintech data science

617
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,120
but then at every Point what I can say

618
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,080
for sure is I did not just rely on my

619
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,840
conventional education I Tred to do more

620
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,799
and then I try to actively seek out what

621
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,399
I'm like truly passionate about and in

622
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,520
order to have that gauge for yourself

623
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:47,840
being a very very active learner will

624
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,840
come into to Great advantage and then

625
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,960
having this all available accessible

626
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,039
resource like ocw will be something that

627
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,919
will meet all your expectations and then

628
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,120
meet the requirements that you have for

629
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,840
yourself but then I feel like ocw is a

630
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,440
great pool of resources where people can

631
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,919
sort of dream about one career pathway

632
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,399
but if that doesn't work out there's

633
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,039
always like different courses that they

634
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,039
can come back to and then explore

635
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,080
further that was such a cool

636
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,919
conversation cool cool conversation I

637
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,760
haven't stopped thinking about it what's

638
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,240
your biggest take away from J's

639
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,559
conversation Michael I love the

640
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,760
conversation with Jam because I think it

641
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,200
shows

642
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,880
the ability to be curious and to still

643
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,840
explore as an undergrad when I first met

644
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Jam she was primarily focused on just

645
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,799
getting her chemistry degree and through

646
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,559
the conversation I had with her but also

647
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,399
with her leveraging open educational

648
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:52,600
resources she was able to expand her

649
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,600
view expand her Consciousness and

650
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,880
ultimately changed what she was studying

651
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,760
in her undergraduate program so I

652
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,159
thought that was very fascinating how

653
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,200
she went from just being focused on

654
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,279
chemistry to start looking at the whole

655
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,760
world and then studying economics as

656
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,519
well I personally loved how she has

657
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,039
experienced learning from all across the

658
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,679
world you know we've heard from her

659
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:18,159
story she was in New Zealand at some

660
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,279
point she's been to Korea and she found

661
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,679
open learning with this whole background

662
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,360
from all these different places and all

663
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,679
these different types of education and

664
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,480
still opcw was something and open

665
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,320
learning was something that could still

666
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,240
add to that and to such a person with

667
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,880
such experience and such diverse range

668
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,600
from and still she comes open learning

669
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,799
and still has something to add her value

670
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,919
I like that aspect of it in that this is

671
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,960
something that can touch anyone from

672
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,840
whatever background from whatever

673
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,720
experience you have it can still add

674
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,159
value to you thanks to everyone for
