Episode

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,040
two. All great ideas start out bad.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,080
All great ideas start out bad. Most look

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
horrible at the start. And yet, this

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
should come as a relief. That idea you

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,320
had or heard this morning that everyone

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,119
laughed at could be the start of

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,200
something. That's right. The idea does

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,800
not need to look disruptive or scalable

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,079
or exponential or like a business yet.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,680
You can start with what you have.

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
This is often difficult for people to

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
accept. Most innovation stories are told

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,079
in hindsight, which creates a cognitive

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
bias. If you have read a lot of

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,160
innovation stories, it may be hard to

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,239
accept that the start of those great

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,879
stories is a poor fit for the

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,800
innovations they became. But success

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,960
isn't hiding in the idea. It follows

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
from what you do next. Here are some

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
examples of bad ideas that graduated

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,920
into becoming great innovation stories

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,159
to tell. In 1878, Sir William Priest,

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,640
who at the time was chief engineer of

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,200
the British post office, mentioned that

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
the lack of voice was causing Americans

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,799
to adopt an idea that had no future. He

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
was talking about the telephone.

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,520
Around 1914, the Ford Motor Company

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
increased worker wages manyifold above

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,040
the minimum wage. Critics thought Henry

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,360
Ford had gone insane. But the Ford Motor

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,759
Company did not go bankrupt like critics

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,439
expected. Instead, they initiated a

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,920
trend in the auto industry that caused

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,000
cars to become affordable. In the late

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,400
1960s, in an interview to the New York

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,360
Times, Dr. May, the inventor of the

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,479
laser, spoke of it as a solution still

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,720
seeking for a problem. Today, lasers are

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,560
everywhere.

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,399
At the turn of the 21st century, one of

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040
the companies from famed investor Vinad

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,759
Kosla had a chance to acquire Google for

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,240
about $750,000.

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,680
They passed. They felt it was too

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,479
expensive. After exiting PayPal, a young

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,800
Elan Musk founded an out for profit

50
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,760
called Mars Oasis to take a small

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
greenhouse to Mars. He and his team

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
tried to buy rockets from a group of

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
Russians, but the Russians laughed at

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,760
them. So instead, they set out to build

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,440
rockets themselves and ended up founding

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
SpaceX.

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,840
In 2021, a new company called Colossal

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
announced plans to bring back the woolly

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,160
mammoth in an attempt to stop climate

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,200
change. You can read about it in the New

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,360
York Times. These examples cover about

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,239
150 years worth of unlikely innovation

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
stories across many domains. investment,

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,879
industrial factories, new technologies,

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
entrepreneurship, not for profits. Even

66
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,400
in every case, an idea that seemed

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,319
preposterous at the time it got started

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
has ended up leading to something we now

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,040
think of as an obvious innovation. Well,

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,280
to be fair, as of the recording of this

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
video, the jury was still out on whether

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
the idea to bring back the woolly

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,280
mammoth will end someplace worth

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
inclusion in the list. But that only

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,920
strengthens the point I have been making

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,480
all along. At the start, preposterous

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
ideas and good ideas look the exact

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,959
same. After hearing all these, many

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
people still find this notion really

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
difficult to accept. You see, most

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
entrepreneurship and innovation

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,720
frameworks create the illusion that you

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,680
just have to find the idea that will

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,360
work and then execute. It's as if the

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,519
idea had to have it all before you even

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,360
start. And so the list of requirements

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
for the idea grows. It has to be

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,760
scalable, disruptive, singular,

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
exponential. It is easy to see why

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,080
people have a hard time letting go of

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,040
that illusion. If ideas came pre-labeled

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
as good, bad, slam dunk, etc., then all

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,519
you'd have to do is talk to a few people

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,920
or users, do a minimum prototype, and

95
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,840
pitch it, and you'd be mostly done. In

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,640
our experience, reality works another

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,400
way. To be clear, there is no guarantee

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,319
that your idea will ever graduate from

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
being bad.

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,000
But all that matters is whether the idea

101
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,560
can supply you with the spunk you need

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,599
to get you started on the real job.

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,200
And the job is to fix the idea. And it

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,760
amounts to being wrong a lot and

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,160
surviving it all. That is what I call

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
being productively wrong. When I say

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,600
this, people often ask, "Oh, you mean

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,000
like fail fast?" No, fail fast and being

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,919
productively wrong are not the same.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
This is a key distinction of this new

111
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,600
mindset.

112
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
The fail fast phrase has been used so

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
much that it now looks like failing is a

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
cause for celebration.

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,759
All you have to do to join the cool kids

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
club and claim yourself an innovator is

117
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,120
to fail. It isn't. It is still better

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
when things work. I cannot fathom Steve

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,520
Jobs celebrating failure that way. And

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
yet a lot of famous people speak often

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,600
of failing. Failing fast and failing

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,759
often, but we really listen to them

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
because of their success. So it is hard

124
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,759
to know what they mean by failing and

125
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,639
what you should get from it. This can

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,240
help. Ditch the fail fast mantra. What

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
matters is to realize that the idea you

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
start with is a poor fit for what you

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
think you want to accomplish. And the

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,199
only way you can discover that is by

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
making your ideas real and tangible. You

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,919
may wonder what I mean by making an idea

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,479
tangible. Nowadays, very often we talk

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
about ideas, we create powerpoints, we

135
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,919
describe them to others, we fall

136
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
increasingly in love with the idea we

137
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,840
had. But that idea only lives on paper.

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,759
By making it tangible, what I'm asking

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
you to do is find a way to make a

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
physical something that you could point

141
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,600
to so that other people can actually see

142
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
your idea somehow in action. Making your

143
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
idea tangible is how you realize you had

144
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,160
not thought it all through and you start

145
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
to learn how you were wrong.

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
I will tell you more about this in

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,520
another video. Finding something wrong

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
about your idea isn't failing. Only

149
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
people afraid to be wrong confuse that

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,280
for failing. Finding something wrong

151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,919
about your idea is how you start fixing

152
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,520
it. You can take forever to do this or

153
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,759
you can find ways to find out how your

154
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,160
idea was wrong sooner. But it isn't

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,800
failing. It is the precise opposite. It

156
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
is a pursuit of excellence.

157
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Innovation rarely emerges from planned

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,440
sloppiness. You have to care about

159
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,840
excellence. You need to hate failing,

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,520
but you cannot be stigmatized by it.

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,759
There is no merit in failing. There is

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,319
no stigma either. But you're in this to

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,479
succeed. So fail only in ways you could

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
not have predicted. As you will see in a

165
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,840
few videos, this mindset, the pursuit of

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
excellence, and the absolute

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,520
determination to not fail is how

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:43,730
astronauts go to space and back.
