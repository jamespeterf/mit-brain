1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Good morning everyone. So hello I'm uh

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,519
Ching. I'm a postto ashme center and I

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,359
have the honor today to introduce you to

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,920
Emma Landberg. Uh Emma welcome. So Emma

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,640
has been a professor at KDH Royal

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,600
Institute in Sweden and where she

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,840
created and served as director of the

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,160
cell atlas part uh part of the human

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,719
protein atlas and the cell atlas images.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,160
You already see a lot actually yesterday

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,960
uh through the talks of uh of the

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,200
speakers. Um so Emma moved to Stanford a

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,600
few years ago and is now also serving as

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
associate professor at bioengineering

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,160
and pathology department. Uh so where

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,160
she is really using deep learning to um

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,399
utilize all the data we've generated in

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,320
the proteomics and imaging to advance

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
the modeling and understanding of

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,960
spatial temporal organization at

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
cellular and subcellular level. I

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,080
personally had the honor of

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,280
collaborating with Emma like a few years

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,920
ago. Best experience so far and even the

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,600
8 a.m. meetings are so enjoyable I have

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,439
to say. Um, and kind of like Emma has

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,119
been pioneering on the science side, but

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,880
also like the way we actually do

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,439
science. I might need to put a spoiler,

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,920
but she has hosted two KGO challenges

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,159
and also Oh, three, I'm sorry,

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
correction. Three Kaggle challenges and

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
also like most amazing like

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,720
collaborating with video gaming company

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
and really allowing every single person

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,280
to be able to contribute to science.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,159
Well, I can go on on telling you how

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,560
amazing like Emma is. And before I take

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
like put out more spoiler alert, Emma,

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,720
please take away. Thank you. That was a

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,520
very sweet introduction. Thank you very

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,439
much. She's amazing by the way. I've

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,840
enjoyed working with her. So today I'm

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,560
going to talk about well what we've

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,880
basically we touched it many times

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
yesterday. So how we can use spatial

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640
predomics to to do cell modeling and

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
we've been talking about virtual cells

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,119
and can we use AI to model cells for

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,959
example. And I think this is a very

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,479
interesting field and I I do think that

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,040
at some point we're going to be able to

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,959
do it. Um but and I've had the pleasure

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
of working with the Chan Zuckerberg

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,720
initiative last year and we organized a

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
series of workshops and really discussed

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,080
this topic more deeply which ended up in

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,080
a perspective paper where we discussed

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,840
if we build virtual cells what what

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
should they be able to do what's needed

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
from the community how would you

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,160
possibly build these cells and such but

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,560
I I just want to point out that a key

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
challenge will be to connect the scales

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
as we all know and as we've discussed

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,480
already from molecules to cells, from

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,440
cells to multisellular system and this

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,000
is not trivial and I will focus on how

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,400
we can do this at the subcellular level

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,959
in my talk today and I would argue that

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,440
protein data will be key for AI virtual

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,360
cells because proteins are the building

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,800
blocks of human biology. They execute

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,959
most of the functions that we have in

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,959
cells. uh transcripts do not and cells

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
are 3D systems consisting of nested

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,319
functional units and we really want to

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
understand this structure and we also

79
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,800
know that there's a lot of moonlighting

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,720
activity or pleotropic effects that

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,440
arises at the proteium level that is

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
very hard to predict from the sequence

83
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,840
level. I would also argue that images

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,840
will be key for AI virtual cells because

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
they're so rich in information related

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
to structure and morphology. They c can

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,959
capture both spatial and temporal

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,720
scales. again trying to to meet that

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
critical gap of how do we bridge the

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,239
scales in virtual cells and I also think

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,159
it's very cool to think of microscopes

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,000
as opportunities for developing

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,480
autonomous instrumentation and very

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,799
like it well tight systems for lab in

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480
the loop experiments. So with that

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,360
little backdrop I'm going to get to my

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,519
my talk for today. So at first I will

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,080
talk a bit about the work that we've

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
done to map where proteins are in our

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
cells and then I'm going to give you

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,680
some different vignettes of how we're

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,080
trying to model cells off from this

103
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,760
data. So uh the interest of my lab is

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
really to measure and model the spatial

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,159
temporal subcellular organization of the

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,560
human proteome with a goal to understand

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,639
how variations in protein distribution

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
can fine-tune cellular function and also

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,479
how misloization can lead to disease.

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,000
and we've been doing uh this type of

111
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,000
work for a long time and we're very

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
proud producers of the human protein

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
atlas project where I'm a co-director.

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,720
So this project is um it's been going on

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,560
for 20 years now and it's an open

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,080
project and we've generated antibodies

117
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,520
for the majority of all human proteins

118
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,919
that we can deploy in a variety of

119
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,639
assays to map where proteins are

120
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,040
expressed. Uh if you haven't checked it

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,000
out, you can find it at

122
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,360
proteinatlas.org. It's fully free, no

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
registration needed. And it's actually

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
we're gaining more and more traction. So

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
the number of users increase every year.

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
Right now it's about 2 million users uh

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
per

128
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,120
year. And and I should say we have

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
nowadays one update every year. So the

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
next update with new data is coming in

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,759
October this year. And the key data in

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,240
the protein atlas is images. We have

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,039
about 20 million images that either are

134
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,360
very classical like no fancy imaging

135
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,199
right now uh immunisttochemistry to the

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,000
left that shows protein expression in

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
cell types of most tissues of the human

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,039
body or confocal microscope images that

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,360
shows the subcellular uh expression of

140
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
proteins within cultivated cell lines.

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
And today we do work with both of these

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,440
image data sets but today I'm going to

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,000
focus on the subcellular aspect of this

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,759
image collection. So the images have

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,280
been generated over many years very

146
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,520
systematically with some reference

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280
markers. So we have dot nuclear staining

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,759
a staining for microtubils a staining

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,680
for ER. So this makes it possible for us

150
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,600
to kind

151
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,120
of orient ourselves in the cells and on

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
top of this we've used our in-house

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,880
generated antibodies to localize most

154
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,199
human proteins one by one. So CD44 would

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,800
look like this. And let's see if the

156
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
pointer works. Yep, we can see that it's

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
expressed at the cell membrane plasma

158
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
membrane of this cell. If we see an

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
image like this, we'll say that this

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
protein in green is localized to actin

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
filaments. Everything has been manually

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,160
annotated over the years. This protein,

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
we see these two dots here. That's the

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
centrosome and so on. So, we've we've

165
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,680
done this for a long time. When we

166
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
published the first paper, the

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
subcellular map of the human proteome,

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,759
we actually provided the first evidence

169
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,039
for localization of that protein for

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,199
over half of all the human proteins. So

171
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,199
it's it's very basic information but

172
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
still very valuable if you want to

173
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
understand protein function and I I'm

174
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,240
not going to talk about that today but I

175
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,000
do want to say that in the last release

176
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,440
we added some new data that we've been

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
working on for many years where we've

178
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
actually localized proteins to the

179
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
primary celium which is a very

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
interesting cellular structure that is

181
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,880
involved in a lot of different diseases

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,440
and also been linked to diseases like

183
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,639
obesity and autism but uh that's for a

184
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,319
different talk but happy to chat about

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
it uh in the break later if someone is

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,240
interested.

187
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,560
So some of the key findings

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,000
that still fascinates us is that here

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
here you can see kind of the classical

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,479
organels. This is a protein in the gyrad

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,160
is in mitochondria and so on. But we

192
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,840
find a lot of proteins that are in

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
multiple compartments as you can see to

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
the left here. This protein is on the

195
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,440
cell surface and in the nucleus. And

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,759
most proteins execute their function by

197
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,080
interacting with other molecules. And it

198
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
is likely to assume that the potential

199
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,199
interactors in the nucleus and the

200
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,960
plasma membrane compartments are

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,319
different. So it might be so that this

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,039
protein is performing two different

203
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
functions in these two different

204
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,160
compartments. The other fascinating

205
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
aspect uh is of course when we see

206
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
variability single cell variability this

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,280
protein is expressed at low level in

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
this cell at a high level here. It's

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,400
actually a cell cycle protein. Uh so

210
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,919
this kind of hint at some kind of

211
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,720
temporal dynamics. So even though the

212
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,160
images are static, we can still assume

213
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
that there is sometimes see signs of

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
temporal dynamics. Most often it doesn't

215
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,000
look this clean. Most often it looks

216
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
something like this. So this is actually

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
a very wellstudied protein. It's enolace

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
one and we know that it has different

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,280
functions in different compartments. So

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
these are all you know it's a cell line

221
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120
all genetic kind of even

222
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,560
transcriptionally very similar cells.

223
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
But if we look at this protein they're

224
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,400
very different. Enolace one performs its

225
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,879
glycolytic canonical function in the

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,039
cytool. It controls gene expression in

227
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
the nucleus and on the plasma membrane

228
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,000
that you can see here, it's actually

229
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,440
functioning as a plasmminogen receptor.

230
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,599
So these cells, even though they're

231
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
genetically and transcriptionally highly

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,759
similar, present very different

233
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,880
functional capacities just by changing

234
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
the amount and the location of this one

235
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,680
protein. So we're not interested in

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,599
inlay one. We're interested in this at a

237
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,279
systems level. So how common if we look

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,440
at the entire proteome, how often do we

239
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,320
see this? So we've been able to show

240
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,080
that close between 50 and 60% of all

241
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,800
human produce proteins localized to

242
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,959
multiple compartments. And I would maybe

243
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,760
I would I dare to say that I do believe

244
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,080
that a lot of these proteins perform

245
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,920
dual functions. And there's a lot of

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,399
unknown biology in there. Um and about

247
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,240
20% of all proteins show signs of

248
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,680
temporal dynamics. And I think this

249
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,920
number is still an underestimate. So

250
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,839
probably it'll get higher. So with with

251
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,600
these conclusions, I would want to argue

252
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,080
that I don't think that we can build

253
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,000
good models of cells unless we take this

254
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
spatial proteome information into

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,519
account because otherwise we're missing

256
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
out on so

257
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:24,600
much biology basically. So how can we do

258
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,320
that?

259
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,120
Um I want to present three different

260
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,040
vignettes and the first one is just can

261
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
we can we make use of a very simple

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,720
metric which is cell shape to try to

263
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
understand all of this because we have a

264
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
a great image collection but it's one

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,399
protein at a time. There's still no

266
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
technology so that we can multiplex

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,760
10,000 proteins and visualize that in a

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,360
single cell. So can we use different

269
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,399
computational frameworks to try to

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,720
aggregate the data basically? So one is

271
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
to to try to use shape modes and this

272
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
has actually been a very fun

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,240
collaboration with Susan Rafalski

274
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,959
sitting there and Matthew Vanna at the

275
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,720
Allen Institute. So we've constructed an

276
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,040
interpretable shape space to study the

277
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
human proteome and we've then mapped all

278
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,600
of these proteins that we've measured

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
onto this shape space and these are some

280
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,920
of the cell lines that we've been

281
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,839
working with. So I just want to show

282
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
that they are of course they look very

283
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,440
different. we have more epithelia or

284
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,560
fibroblast like cell lines and there's

285
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,959
also some blood hematopoetic cell lines

286
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
and so so we use the same framework that

287
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,640
Susan and her group developed and showed

288
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,160
in her I think she briefly showed that

289
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,360
nature paper uh on her slides. So

290
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,839
basically we start by segmenting the

291
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,480
cell in the nucleus and then we

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,320
basically trace the contour here and you

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
get this wavelike pattern and then we

294
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,079
perform a fourier transform so that we

295
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,920
get these coefficients and then we do uh

296
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,760
dimensionality reduction and then we

297
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,800
reconstruct the cell. So we get the

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,600
average cell shape and then we can walk

299
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,839
along do a standard deviation walk along

300
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,920
the PCs to see what the shape mode

301
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,920
variations

302
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,000
are. So if we do this uh in these plots

303
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
you can see what how the cell shapes

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,399
change in the different this is PC1 PC2

305
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,000
PC3 etc. And these are, of course, they

306
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,600
don't look like the real cells, but it's

307
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
basically the this is basically based on

308
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
the assumption that cells have very

309
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,240
complex shapes, but maybe they're made

310
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,279
up of a a series of common shape mode

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,279
variations that we can combine. So, uh,

312
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,640
for example, here you can see all the

313
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
different cell lines that we tested. You

314
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,959
see the average cells look pretty

315
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,680
similar in shape, but different in size,

316
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,200
slightly different. Uh what is very cool

317
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,200
though is that the shape modes are

318
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
highly conserved and basically exactly

319
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
the same for all of these cell types

320
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,120
even though they're different. So we

321
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,440
have like the size length changing the

322
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,160
size and the polarization changing the

323
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,800
nuclear positioning the width versus

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,839
length and kind of center of mass shifts

325
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,680
and things like that. So now when we

326
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,079
have these shape modes can we then map

327
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,600
proteium protein data onto it and does

328
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,440
it make sense? So we've tried doing this

329
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,760
for comparing cell shapes, organal

330
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
shapes, pathways, single proteins and I

331
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,519
will take you through some of that. So

332
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,519
first of all when we map the protein

333
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,320
expression we ended up using a

334
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,560
deformation field. So basically we we

335
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
deform the real cell staining into this

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,920
average cell shape and then we get we

337
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,839
can do that for let's say pick 200

338
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,839
nuclear proteins and we average them all

339
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,079
and then we get this average nucleoplast

340
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,360
staining in a given cell shape. Same

341
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,360
thing for the mitochondria. So it

342
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,440
becomes of course very diffuse because

343
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
it's the average. But we still see

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
different patterns for all the different

345
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
organels. So what we can do then with

346
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
these different patterns that we is that

347
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,639
we can correlate them and see how do the

348
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,200
different organal organal distributions

349
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,720
correlate in different shape modes. So

350
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
thinking of what Jennifer talked about

351
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
yesterday. She showed beautifully

352
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,519
beautifully with her cryo data that the

353
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,120
the correlation between organals is

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
highly conserved and we're actually

355
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
seeing the same thing. So this is in one

356
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,800
of the cell lines, the Utoos cells. We

357
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,320
see this is the correlation between all

358
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
the different organels. And of course it

359
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,120
makes biological sense like the nucleol

360
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,120
like correlates to the nucleus and so

361
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,680
on. Uh but what is very cool is that

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,279
when we compare the extreme and this

363
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
correlation looks slightly different for

364
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
different cell types. But when we

365
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
compare this correlation in the standard

366
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
cell shape and the extreme versions, we

367
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
compare the the round cell to the

368
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,800
elongated cell for example or the the

369
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,720
yeah we can see that this correlation is

370
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,160
highly conserved across all these shape

371
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,600
modes even though it's slightly

372
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,120
different for the different cell types.

373
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,360
So that's good. That means that we

374
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
should be able to like this structure is

375
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,880
preserved and it means that maybe

376
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
there's some kind of generalizability

377
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,120
lying in here when we think about

378
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,279
virtual cells too. Uh and then we

379
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,480
thought about what if we try to enrich

380
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,320
for look for variable proteins and see

381
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,920
if we can find certain proteins or

382
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,880
pathway that are enriched in certain

383
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,399
shape modes. So we did this and here you

384
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,480
can see how different proteins are

385
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,560
expressed in the different PCs the

386
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,360
different shape modes and we found over

387
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
500 proteins that vary significantly

388
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
through shape space. A lot of them are

389
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,399
cell cycle proteins of course but many

390
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,320
and they enriched pathways are

391
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,000
interestingly related to both cell cycle

392
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,600
metabolic and signaling

393
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,360
processes and we can go even further and

394
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,199
start to look into really like fine

395
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,120
grain things. So as an example I'm just

396
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,880
showing we we had a cell cycle marker in

397
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,120
a big image data set. So we said let's

398
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,360
look at cells in in one cell state.

399
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,279
Let's look only at G2 cells and then we

400
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,360
compare round cells versus elongated

401
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,880
cells in G2. Do they show any difference

402
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
in protein expression? So when we

403
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,639
aggregate this data of of differentially

404
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
expressed proteins here, we see that

405
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,480
they actually we we see different

406
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
pathways expressed and it seems like the

407
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
round cells are really focused on

408
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
oxidative phosphorilation and seem to be

409
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,480
preparing for division whereas the

410
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
elongated cells show enrichment for

411
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,680
pathways that relate to lipid metabolism

412
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,279
and migratory uh patterns. So maybe they

413
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,639
are actually preparing to migrate and

414
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,880
not directly divide. And of course we

415
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,880
can go back to the proteins that kind of

416
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,120
contributed to this enrichment and see

417
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,360
that these are the cells that we can

418
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,120
classify as round cells and elongated

419
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,399
cells. And yes we can actually visually

420
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,560
also observe this difference difference

421
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,240
in expression but it is a lot easier to

422
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,959
interpret in this aggregated shape

423
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,480
space. So in total uh in summary uh we

424
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,839
believe that these interpretable shape

425
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,720
space are very it's a very useful

426
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,399
pipeline maybe not the right tool to

427
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,480
build a virtual cell model but I think

428
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,160
it's a very good good pipeline to

429
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,839
understand your image data sets let's

430
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,000
say if you do an optical pool screen and

431
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,199
you want to see how do my population of

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,199
cells change for example it's it's a a

433
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
great pipeline to just understand the

434
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,480
baseline of cell distributions that you

435
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,639
have and if you have any significant

436
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,079
shifts in this space. I didn't talk

437
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,519
about it here, but we can also do this

438
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,040
at the protein level upon drug

439
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,040
pertubation. And then it turns out that

440
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,360
it's very helpful to stratify the data

441
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,160
into shape modes before you start to

442
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,839
look for significantly uh affected uh

443
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:11,519
proteins as well. So with that, can we

444
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,759
besides aggregating the data like this

445
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,440
can we think about building spatial cell

446
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,880
models and what could that be? What's

447
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,639
the best spatial model we have right

448
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
now? probably gene ontology cell

449
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,480
components still some kind of

450
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,480
hierarchical cell structure. So can we

451
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,519
use our data to build something like

452
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,040
that? And uh we've uh worked recently in

453
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,560
collaboration also with the transber

454
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,399
initiative to build subscell. It's a

455
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,120
suite of self-supervised deep learning

456
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,279
models uh for florescent microscopy. And

457
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,480
what we wanted to do here is to build a

458
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,560
model that can both classify patterns,

459
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,120
embed spatial patterns of proteins, but

460
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,720
also understand morphology of cells and

461
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,480
phenotypes because I think those are the

462
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,279
two main use cases like drug

463
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,920
pertubations, crisper

464
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,680
pertubations and also localization of

465
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,440
proteins. Uh and of course we want to

466
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,519
have a model that can provide us

467
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,400
insights to biology beyond what we can

468
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,039
kind of perceive with our eyes. And the

469
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,000
hypothesis here is that we can while our

470
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,839
data set is not the largest in terms of

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,520
number of images like the jump data set

472
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,000
is big there are some massive data sets

473
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,839
out there but it is the most diverse

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,439
data set when it comes to patterns

475
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,959
because we don't only have five markers

476
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
we have all human proteins. So we

477
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,120
thought that even if this is a smaller

478
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,120
data set, we can still it's still a

479
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,720
pretty big data set but we can build a

480
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,960
broadly useful microscopy vision model

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,799
and hopefully this model will have

482
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
learned to pay biologically relevant

483
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,480
attention because we've trained it with

484
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,480
images of all intracellular human

485
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,240
proteins or less. So uh this is the

486
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
architecture that we ended up with. It's

487
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,200
a bas it's a vision transformer

488
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,120
basically with three different uh losses

489
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,919
and tasks. So it's a reconstruction task

490
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,919
which is great for usually great for

491
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
building models to classify morphology.

492
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,520
It's not great. Those models aren't very

493
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
performant when it comes to classifying

494
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,400
some cellular patterns though. So that's

495
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,480
why we added also two different um

496
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
contrastive functions here. One focused

497
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
on on the cells and augmenting it and

498
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,039
one focused on on different proteins and

499
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
making assumptions that it's this

500
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,880
protein is more likely to have a similar

501
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,160
pattern in a different cell line than

502
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,520
compared to a completely different

503
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,000
protein for example. So we're making

504
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,440
some assumptions about biology here and

505
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,840
I will show you the results for our top

506
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,080
two best models. So we first of all test

507
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,400
them on two very like the two tasks that

508
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,000
we want to do pattern classification and

509
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
then phenotype classification. And here

510
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,600
we just use can we classify different

511
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
cell types. A very simple tasks and we

512
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,919
compare it to what we consider to be

513
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,640
state-of-the-art model models the um

514
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,080
dino for cells model and then also what

515
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
we call best fitting. So this is the

516
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,679
winning model from one of our previous

517
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,240
Kaggle competition which is a supervised

518
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,080
model and basically our models

519
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
outperform the state-of-the-art in both

520
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,919
of these tasks. So that's a very good

521
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,440
starting

522
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:59,039
point but we also want to go beyond what

523
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
the human eye can do. So in order to

524
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,480
test this we try to predict pathways

525
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
from these embeddings and also predict

526
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
protein protein interactions. And of

527
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
course we're perform it's performing

528
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
better than the other models but it's

529
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,440
it's very hard to predict pathways only

530
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,559
from microscope images but we can

531
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
actually predict start to predict

532
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,080
protein protein interactions pretty well

533
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,320
and also outperforms the other models

534
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,280
here. Uh we then started to analyze the

535
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,120
attention to kind

536
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,720
of go back to our hypothesis was it

537
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,320
useful to train on the protein atlas

538
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,799
data and we were so surprised when we

539
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,440
saw these these uh the patch attention

540
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,440
generated by well in in the transformer.

541
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
So these are all the different attention

542
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
heads and if you look at these images it

543
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,320
almost looks like imunostating or or

544
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,919
different organels. Attention head four

545
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,080
clearly only pays attention to the

546
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,039
nucleoli. Attention head seven looks at

547
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,919
this region on one side of the nucleus.

548
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,559
Attention head six has kind of more

549
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,039
membranous general all membranes in the

550
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,720
cell type of attention. And let's see

551
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,919
attention at 12 looks at the plasma

552
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,120
membrane. So it's kind of cool that the

553
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,880
model has taught itself to look at

554
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,480
regions in the cell where we know that

555
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,000
proteins are distributed and we believe

556
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,600
that this these are biologically

557
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,240
relevant regions and that's maybe why

558
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,640
the model has good

559
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,080
performance. And if we also look at the

560
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,600
correlation of the attention to the

561
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,000
different tasks that we're trying to do

562
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,000
and these are just a lot of different

563
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,480
cells where we've a lot of every dot

564
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,280
here is a cell and then we just link the

565
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,679
attention to uh the different cell lines

566
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,880
and also the different protein

567
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,640
localization locations. We can see that

568
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,360
these are really encoded orthogonally

569
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,080
here. Right? So the model has learned to

570
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,200
think about both morphology and location

571
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,799
of proteins without confounding them too

572
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
much. Which means we were very excited

573
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,480
about this because this means that we

574
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,320
can start to maybe compare protein

575
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,559
distribution patterns in cells that have

576
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,120
very different morphology which has been

577
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,799
very hard to do

578
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,120
before. Uh besides that we wanted to

579
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,039
test this model

580
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,600
on other data sets. No no fine-tuning

581
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,600
here. We just test it exactly as is. So

582
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,280
we tested it to on the open cell data

583
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,039
set which is a data set with just pure

584
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
markers two markers and it it

585
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,080
outperformed the model that was

586
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,919
specifically trained on open cell. We

587
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,600
also tested it on a bridge to AI data

588
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,919
set that we've generated but this is a

589
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,360
new cell type that it hasn't seen in

590
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,600
training and it's also drug perturbed

591
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,039
cells. So we were able to show that we

592
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,400
can bring all of these drug perturbed

593
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,000
cells and other cells into a joint

594
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,039
embedding with this model and we can

595
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,080
identify relocizing proteins upon drug

596
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,840
perturbation in this embedding space.

597
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,200
And then what we were most excited about

598
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,760
is that when we even apply it to the

599
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,080
jump data set which is images of quite

600
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,679
different resolution and such we can

601
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,320
actually outperform the existing models

602
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,240
that were trained on jump in tasks like

603
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,600
mechanism of action prediction. So again

604
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
we believe that this is because the

605
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,840
model has learned to pay attention to

606
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,039
biologically relevant regions. And of

607
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,400
course we're excited to start to

608
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,480
fine-tune the model for some of these

609
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
tasks as well. But with that in mind,

610
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,039
we're pretty confident that this is a a

611
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,799
robust model for embedding cells from

612
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,880
microscope images. So what can we do

613
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,400
with that? Can we embed all the images

614
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,240
from the protein atlas and start to

615
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,039
build some kind of graph that looks a

616
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,960
bit like the geneontology cellular

617
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,880
component? And yes, we can. This is the

618
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,400
graph that we get if we we build it from

619
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
all the human protein atlas images.

620
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
You'll have a hard time to read the

621
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
labels here, but this is the cell. And

622
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,200
then we do just hierarchical clustering.

623
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,679
And you can see that and the the labels

624
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
here are from either go cellular

625
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,360
component at the bottom layer is from go

626
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,120
biological process. You see we get the

627
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,600
nucleus the cytoplasm and then that

628
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,159
splits up into like the cytool the

629
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,080
endommembrane system and m and filaments

630
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,880
and and deeper and deeper. So basically

631
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,480
it recap recapitulates what we know

632
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
about biology and how the cell is

633
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,960
organized. But then when we start to get

634
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,799
down to this level we're seeing clusters

635
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,159
that we couldn't have annotated by eye.

636
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,480
And this is where it's interesting to

637
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,840
start to inspect them. So for example,

638
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,600
here we see a cluster

639
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,600
of proteins involved in translation

640
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,240
ribosomal proteins. We could not have

641
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,320
annotated that. Uh I also really like

642
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,480
these clusters. So it's it's a subsplit

643
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,679
of a nuclear of proteins localized to

644
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
the nuclear membrane. And when we look

645
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,760
at the proteins in these different

646
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,360
classes, one of them is structural

647
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,480
proteins that are involved in

648
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,720
maintaining the structure of the

649
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,120
nucleus. One of them is protein involved

650
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,840
in export from the nucleus. One is

651
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,440
protein involved in import to the

652
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,559
nucleus. Uh so so it's it's very cool

653
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,000
that we're starting to see these

654
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
functional differences that we could

655
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
never ever have annotated by ice. I do

656
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
think that these models capture

657
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,440
information that is relevant to

658
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,200
understand biology and this model uh as

659
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,280
a collaboration with CCI it's available

660
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,880
on their virtual cell modeling web page.

661
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,440
And there's also a demo where we use

662
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,720
this model to understand how SARS KV2

663
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,880
relocizes protein upon infection.

664
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,960
But with that uh even if it's it's nice

665
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,440
that we can have this graph of cells,

666
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
how can we go beyond like there's a

667
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,960
limit to the resolution in our images.

668
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,159
It's confocal microscopy. How how can we

669
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,480
try to go beyond that down to kind of

670
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,480
protein protein

671
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,240
interactions and uh how can we improve

672
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,360
the spatial precision of these cell maps

673
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,799
to true complex level and this is uh the

674
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,440
project that we've been working with UA

675
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,799
on. So it's been basically two

676
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,720
publications and we had the most recent

677
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,120
one now in nature two weeks ago. So this

678
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,960
is from the newer newer paper. So the

679
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,960
idea here is that maybe we can build

680
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
such an hierarchical map if we integrate

681
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
two types of spatial data. The image

682
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,559
data that describes the global

683
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,080
distribution of proteins in a cell and

684
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,919
the protein protein interaction data

685
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
that describes the local distribution of

686
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,400
proteins in in the neighborhood of any

687
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,000
given protein. And we can use machine

688
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,679
learning to to integrate those data

689
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,080
types and build a hierarchical model of

690
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
the cell. So for this we used the UTOS

691
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,200
cells and all our images we've generated

692
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,360
and then uh Steve Giggy and Ed Hutlin

693
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,600
here at Harvard uh generated protein

694
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,559
protein inter interaction data. We're

695
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,799
still limited for data. So this is not a

696
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,640
protein wide map. This is only 5,000

697
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,360
proteins and we're limited because of

698
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
the lack of PPI data. So if anyone is

699
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
interested in generating protein protein

700
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,880
interaction data at scale that would be

701
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,799
incredible. Uh so what first thing that

702
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,480
we do is of course that we we embed each

703
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,640
data type alone with our machine

704
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
learning models and a node to graph

705
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,799
model and then we bring these embeddings

706
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,480
into a joint embedding space. And then

707
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,760
here's the joint embedding space. We can

708
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,760
of course start to look at it and see

709
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,240
that yes we're keeping all of these kind

710
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,000
of clusters that resemble organels. And

711
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
if we go further in we can also again

712
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,240
start to see these clusters that are

713
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,840
more biologically refined probably

714
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,360
driven by by the protein protein

715
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,240
interaction data. So there's definitely

716
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,840
biologically relevant information in the

717
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,679
structure of this embedding. And what we

718
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,799
also do then is that we use this trick

719
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,840
that actually works pretty well that we

720
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:47,320
calibrate the size of

721
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,799
the of clusters

722
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,200
to basic this is a bit complicated to to

723
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,000
describe. Basically it turns out that

724
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,919
the size of any structure in this

725
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,279
assembly correlates very well to the

726
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,640
number number of known proteins in that

727
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,159
structure. So the size of the gold

728
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
chapatus according to literature and

729
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,039
structural studies corresponds to the

730
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,799
number of known proteins in it. We get a

731
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,640
pretty nice linear correlation there. So

732
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,400
we use this linear correlation in order

733
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,080
to be able to estimate the actual size

734
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,159
of systems that we can identify in this

735
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,000
embedding. And in this embedding we can

736
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,600
do hierarchical clustering and build a

737
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,520
similar map to the one that I showed you

738
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,440
before. There are some differences here.

739
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,720
Proteins are allowed to be in

740
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,880
multiple nodes for example if they

741
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,480
perform multiple functions. Uh and as

742
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,080
you can see we have all these major

743
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
organels but then we have a lot of the

744
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,000
smaller kind of systems here driven by

745
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,559
the protein protein interaction data. In

746
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,880
total uh we identified this is nearly

747
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,200
300 different cellular systems. All the

748
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,120
yellow ones are known in geneontology

749
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
and literature. All the purple ones are

750
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,080
new. We've spent a lot of time

751
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,679
validating that they are indeed real

752
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,880
systems but that was more described in

753
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,880
the first paper. So I'm not going to go

754
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,600
through that now. Instead, I'm going to

755
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,080
focus on how we can use these maps and

756
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,720
to do better functional genomics and

757
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,320
better understand

758
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,480
biology.

759
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,080
So, for

760
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,159
example, here is an interesting system,

761
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,840
the rag regulator complex. It's known,

762
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,919
we have a structure for it, but we found

763
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,720
two additional proteins in this system.

764
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,200
Okay, how can we validate that? So here

765
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,799
we worked with Andre Shali at UCSF to do

766
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,480
structural modeling and he showed that

767
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,840
these two additional proteins bor S6 and

768
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,480
ITPA can actually bind to the known rag

769
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,720
regulator complex in this way. So

770
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,960
basically these systems can be used to

771
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,960
guide alpha fold and kind of structural

772
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
modeling principles and it would be kind

773
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,400
of cool to think about folding

774
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,799
everything with everything using these

775
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,640
maps as a kind of scaffold to reduce the

776
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,240
search space.

777
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,000
Uh so that's one way you can use this

778
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,720
map. Another way is that we use this map

779
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,559
to to uh use as assemblies as

780
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,440
convergence points for pediatric cancer

781
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,039
mutations. So here we took very big

782
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,399
pediatric mutational data sets that have

783
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,919
been published and when we map it onto

784
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,600
these assemblies, we identify that

785
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,600
there's there are certain systems that

786
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,120
are consistently disrupted in certain

787
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,640
pediatric cancers that were not

788
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,559
discovered in these initial papers

789
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,960
because the mutations might be hitting

790
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,720
different genes. But for example, these

791
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,600
genes are often involved in collagen

792
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,760
biosynthesis or in this nuclear complex

793
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
associated pores. So it's also a way of

794
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,480
using just aggregating data on top of

795
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,039
it. Uh a datadriven cell map. Basically

796
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,039
what we also did uh which I think is

797
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,600
interesting, we were able to propose

798
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,679
function for 46 proteins that have no

799
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,760
known function and we were also able to

800
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,720
suggest additional secondary functions

801
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,000
to 951 proteins using a guilt by

802
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,159
association principle uh by just as

803
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
these assemblies. So this map is

804
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,520
currently being uploaded into the EBI

805
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
complex portal and we hope that people

806
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,520
will use it. I and I personally think it

807
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,840
would be very nice to see more

808
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
datadriven cell maps like this that have

809
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,600
not been biased by our assumption of

810
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,880
biology and how biology should be and I

811
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,520
think it would be very interesting to

812
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,200
have maps for different cell types as

813
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,679
well so we can understand how much

814
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,679
rewiring there is in a cell between

815
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,440
different cell types. So with that end a

816
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,399
very very very short ending. I also

817
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,080
think that this is cool but the image

818
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,919
space is even cooler. I kind of want to

819
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
pull it back into the image space again

820
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,600
because again it's interpretable. It's

821
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,960
close to the bench and it's a place

822
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,799
where we can do a lot of validation

823
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,039
experiments and this is where we think

824
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,919
about generative models as kind of

825
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,840
virtual microscope. So at some point we

826
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,720
also want to go towards that lab in the

827
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,559
loop where we well predict what a where

828
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,080
a protein would be or a pathway which

829
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,919
pathway is affected where would this

830
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,919
protein be which experiment can we do to

831
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,279
validate it and then do that experiment

832
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
in the microscope and then we want to

833
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,799
generate synthetic images to do so. So

834
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,000
we've trained models that can generate

835
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,399
very realistic images denovo. We've

836
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,080
trained organal specific models that so

837
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,600
inputting these different organels we

838
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,399
can generate images of the other

839
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,640
organels for example and we're also

840
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,559
training a model uh with the aim to

841
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,399
basically build a synthetic image that

842
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,480
multiplexes all human proteins so that

843
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,799
we can bring these maps back into the

844
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,520
image space. But for many many reasons

845
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,880
this is a difficult task and I I don't

846
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,760
think I have time to talk about that

847
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,760
now. And of course in the end ultimately

848
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,000
going from sequence to image would be a

849
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,600
goal but there's a lot of of problems to

850
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,440
solve before we're there and we probably

851
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,559
need a lot of additional data types to

852
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,440
do that well. And with that I'd like to

853
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:33,159
thank my group and uh thank you and

854
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,159
happy to take any questions.

855
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,050
[Applause]

856
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,080
Hi very nice talk. I was wondering for

857
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,760
the protein interaction prediction um

858
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,480
can you actually predict like real

859
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,960
interactions versus uh collocicalization

860
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,120
into the same compartment? Yeah. So what

861
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,200
we did in that plot is that we of course

862
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,960
what we can predict in the image space

863
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,240
is probably collocicalization but that

864
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,600
has a pretty good correlation to

865
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,520
interaction. So when we compare it with

866
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,039
it we we tried to predict the string

867
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,320
score which is a likelihood of

868
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:10,080
interactions. So we we can predict the

869
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,320
string score pretty well, but of course

870
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,279
it's not going to be Yeah, we can't do

871
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,279
anything beyond the resolution of the

872
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,279
images.

873
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,720
Oh, just a follow-up question. Have you

874
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
tried to look into like co-evolution of

875
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,320
those proteins that you predict to be

876
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,399
interacting together? If they

877
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,200
collocicalize and they interact, you

878
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,320
might see co-evolution signals.

879
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,919
Sorry. Sorry.

880
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,240
um like have you tried to look into

881
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,760
co-evolution signals of um those

882
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,440
proteins that you predict to interact

883
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,519
since they are localized the same place

884
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,600
and interacting and maybe with um yeah

885
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,600
multiple sequence alignment for alpha

886
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,080
you can explore that a bit. Yeah. Yeah.

887
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,440
That's a very good question. So to uh

888
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,279
what we've done we've done a lot of

889
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,799
things there but then we realized that

890
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,559
there's a lot of papers that just

891
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,240
predict locations from sequence

892
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,840
mitochondria. It's described as a solved

893
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,080
problem in literature and it's actually

894
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,720
not solved. I didn't present that here.

895
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,640
So we've spent a lot of time uh making a

896
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
better benchmark data set than what the

897
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,720
community has used uh that is highly

898
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,880
validated not only protein plus data but

899
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
other like three sources two sources of

900
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,960
experimental validation and when we

901
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,440
apply and that benchmark data set is

902
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,679
also balanced with all locations and

903
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,720
balanced in terms of sequence features

904
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,120
and when we apply the best models today

905
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,960
on predicting location on that benchmark

906
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,039
they all perform very well. they perform

907
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,440
pretty okay on nuclear cytoplasm and

908
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,120
some other locations but certain

909
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,360
cellular compartments they can just

910
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
never predict. So I think that this is

911
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,279
where we need more information than

912
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,960
amino acid sequence alone. We probably

913
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,240
need regulatory regions, UTR regions. Uh

914
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,159
we can have also been trying different

915
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,480
protein embedding models. Some of them

916
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,559
work well if it's like a long intrinsic

917
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,440
disorder region. It might work well in

918
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,360
predicting some locations, but certain

919
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
times it's just one amino acid that is

920
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,679
changing and most models don't capture

921
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
that. So I think that like it's nothing

922
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,320
that my lab will do but I think it will

923
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,760
be very interesting to start to think

924
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,760
about location as one of the features

925
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,600
you want to predict with protein models

926
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,320
and when you design molecules and new

927
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,320
proteins maybe not only design the

928
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
protein with a a certain function in

929
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,679
mind but also with a certain location in

930
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,440
mind because there are certain classes

931
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,000
of proteins where that location really

932
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,039
matters for its function. Awesome. Not

933
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,039
really an answer to your question, but

934
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,080
so when you look at your new ontologies

935
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,399
that you're finding, do you also find

936
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,399
places where you want to where your your

937
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,960
model or your data wants to change the

938
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,440
tree structure? Because over the years

939
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,880
predicting protein function, a lot of

940
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,000
people would do that work complain that

941
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,679
that tree is not always right, I guess.

942
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,159
Yeah. I think I think that the high

943
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,000
level tree like the organels are are

944
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,399
pretty robust and right. Yeah. Yeah.

945
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,919
Yeah. Down there I think there's a lot

946
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,440
of rewriting to do. And I also think

947
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,240
that we're still a bit data limited

948
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,919
because when it comes to like below the

949
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,600
the miso scale where you have a lot of

950
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,960
face separated systems and things like

951
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,480
that, we're probably going to have to

952
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,760
build sequence image models to really

953
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,040
capture that. And I'm guessing that

954
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,200
we're going to see a lot of shuffling in

955
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,200
these ontologies when when we do that.
