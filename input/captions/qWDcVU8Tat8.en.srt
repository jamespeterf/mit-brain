welcome everyone and thank you all for

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,519
being here um on behalf of women atro

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,880
and equity and biom Medicine we're

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,920
thrilled to have Dr Nasha chway here

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,359
with us today to talk about racial

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,560
disparities in cancer research Nasha CH

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,439
PhD is an assistant professor at The

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,199
Institute for molecular medicine at the

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,720
fight Institute for medical research in

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,920
2014 she received her PhD in

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
computational biology from while Cornell

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,000
medicine in New York

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,800
she then went on to complete her

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
post-doctoral training at The Institute

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,480
for systems biology in

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,120
2019 with the late Dr Ilia shmulovich in

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,160
cancer integrative genomic analysis and

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,320
biomarker Discovery Dr CH analyzes

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,680
patient derived data sets in order to

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,719
understand the risk for cancer

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,719
development and progression how tumors

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,760
respond to treatment and how to better

23
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,719
predict effective treatment regimens to

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,519
improve cancer outcomes a particular

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,559
focus of her work is an understanding

26
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,720
the biological basis for cancer Health

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,600
disparities experienced by understudied

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,840
populations particularly those of

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,720
African descent and with an eye toward

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,799
informing better interventions that will

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,680
lead to Equitable Health outcomes thank

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,680
you all for being

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,960
here thank you for that wonderful

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,360
introduction Ro uh good afternoon to

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,320
everybody uh this afternoon we're going

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,920
to have a a discussion uh a provocative

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,159
discussion about a topic that is close

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,280
to my heart um and to the heart of many

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,479
people and we set up the session this

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,640
afternoon I'm going to give a short

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,719
overview talk of this area of uh cancer

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
disparities so it's a quick overview

43
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,799
talk um just introducing Concepts and

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,159
the general motivating the problem and

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,200
then Dr Alicia uh Dr um Martin and I are

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,920
going to have uh a chat a Fireside cat

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,920
it's rather cool here in Boston this

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,560
afternoon uh we have the chairs but not

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,720
the fire uh but hopefully we'll bring

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,440
the fire with the discussion and of

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,200
course we'll at that point open it up

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,680
for discussion uh to the room um okay

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,400
and so to get started I thought we' just

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,120
um start with a definition okay cancer

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,440
Health disparities are differences in

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,440
disease measures between population

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,120
groups so you can consider the measures

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
as incident or prevalence or mortality

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,599
morbidity Etc as listed on the slide and

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,560
we typically when you hear cancer

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,120
disparities it's easy to jump

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,159
immediately to racial and ethnic

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,360
disparities but I want to highlight at

64
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,159
this juncture that there are many

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,800
population groups who

66
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,800
experience

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,720
um uh outcomes that are not positive

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,519
compared to other groups that are

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,760
defined on many axes of how they

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:03,400
self-identify so that includes by

71
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,640
socioeconomic status or by um uh their

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,400
uh individuals with disability or how

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,560
individuals identify by their sexual or

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,200
gender identity so I don't want to us to

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,640
leave this room this afternoon uh

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,280
believing only that people of racial and

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,400
ethnic uh minorities in the US are the

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,400
only ones who experience disparities

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,879
there are inequities in many population

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,760
groups across the board in cancer and so

81
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,760
I want us to keep that in mind

82
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,480
um my group studies racial and ethnic

83
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,080
disparities and these are well

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
documented and have persistent for a

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,400
long time so this is data from the

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,480
NCI program which uh epidemiological

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,799
surveillance database where we're

88
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,760
looking here at mortality age adjusted

89
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:57,239
mortality from 2000 to

90
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,319
2019 by race and ethnicity so how people

91
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,120
self-identify and we can see that

92
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:06,799
although in general mortality in due to

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,920
cancer across different sites is going

94
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,840
down uh that um there are still

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,480
persistent differences if we look here

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,440
at the end of the graph here when this

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,280
last data was collected in

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,199
2019 that mortality uh is higher in

99
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,720
certain groups that identify for example

100
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,560
here non-hispanic groups have the

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,040
highest

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,600
mortality in cancer across the board in

103
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,919
the US

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,280
um just so that we are not singularly

105
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,160
focused on the US we also see just

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,919
abundant Global variation in cancer

107
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,039
incidents and mortality

108
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,520
globally um this data is looking at the

109
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,039
annualized rate of change in terms of

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,479
cancer incidents over the same sort of

111
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:58,000
10 10 years as we looked at in the in

112
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,639
the previous data and we're seeing a

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,120
recent Trend where we seeing in low and

114
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,400
middle inome countries a rapid increase

115
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,160
in cancer

116
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,880
incidents uh that is projected to be

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,360
very very high over the next 30 to 50

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,000
years according to un who data so this

119
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,520
problem of differences in in cancer

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,080
outcomes and incidents is predicted to

121
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,639
be an even major public challenge Public

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,840
Health Challenge

123
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,360
worldwide if we

124
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,960
consider the income levels of different

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,680
countries across the globe we see that

126
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,440
the estimated new cancer cases uh those

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,039
rates are different according to the

128
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:45,919
whether or not the countries are

129
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:48,600
classified as High High um HDI so sort

130
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,600
of their socioeconomic development index

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,039
so high HDI countries versus low HDI

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,840
countries basically poorer countries are

133
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,240
expected to have a much larger incident

134
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,080
of are projected to have much larger

135
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,680
incident of cancer so if you consider

136
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,759
some of these um factors driving

137
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,120
disparities across groups whether it's

138
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,919
by socioeconomic status how people

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,000
self-identify by racial ethnicity where

140
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,599
people live Etc the issue of cancer

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,319
Health disparities is not Germain or

142
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,479
unique to the US but is projected to be

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,520
a significant Global issue facing us

144
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,880
over the coming

145
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,240
years so what do we know drives and

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,759
causes this disparities so there are

147
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,840
several buckets of factors that are

148
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,240
known to contribute so environmental

149
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,240
factors are some of among some of the

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,199
most quoted for example are exposures to

151
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,840
um environmental toxins air quality

152
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,960
Transportation where we live the places

153
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,759
where we live contribute to a disease

154
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,680
risk that instinctively makes sense to

155
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,080
us uh behavioral factors such as our

156
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,599
diet our our level of EX ize um our

157
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,360
adherence to health behaviors that

158
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,680
contribute to our overall health social

159
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,639
factors including health literacy the

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,840
level of Education our income as well as

161
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,919
our ability to access health care and

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,440
then individual cultures we see

163
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,360
differences in incidents and mortality

164
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,759
in different places all those places

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,759
have different localized cultures and

166
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,240
different beliefs that contribute to

167
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,360
their health outcomes psychological

168
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,960
factors like stress have been reported

169
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,720
to be associated with cancer incidents

170
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,400
and outcomes and certainly for many of

171
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,440
us in the room who've come to this

172
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,840
problem uh being interested in

173
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,800
biological and genetic determinants of

174
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,319
of of disparities in

175
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
cancer when you see these factors listed

176
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:53,000
like this it's difficult to think of a

177
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,039
framework to put it all together with so

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,199
the aacr has this organizing framework

179
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,960
they recently published in their cancer

180
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,319
disparities report that looks at how

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,879
these factors interact together in a

182
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,800
framework that is driven Upstream by uh

183
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,400
structural factors in the US such as

184
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,080
racism uh which lead to structural

185
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,319
inequities and societal

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,199
injustices which acting through all

187
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,440
these factors jointly contributes to

188
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,000
cancer inequities and disparities across

189
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,199
the cancer Continuum so when we refer to

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,760
the cancer Continuum as you know risk

191
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,159
early detection cancer development

192
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,159
treatment treatment outcomes and

193
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,880
survivorship um my particular area of

194
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,000
focus and interest in is in the

195
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,760
biological and genetic factors uh and so

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,560
we've come at this from this sort of EP

197
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,760
lens of racial and ethnic disparities in

198
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,600
cancer but I've also told you that I'm

199
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
interested in the biologic and genetic

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,160
drivers so there's a little bit of in

201
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,959
congruence here because I'm interested

202
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,560
in a biologic and genetic aspect of

203
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,880
disparities but it's defined by a social

204
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,320
construct so I'm going to take a little

205
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,320
bit of a segue here to talk about the

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,560
social

207
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,680
constructs of race and

208
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,880
ethnicity um so race is defined by um as

209
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,839
a category of humankind that shares

210
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,160
distinct physical traits or ethnicity by

211
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,560
how groups identify according to Common

212
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,760
sort of racial National tribal uh or

213
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,040
religious background so it's how people

214
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,480
self-identify based on uh where they

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,560
come from what they believe about thems

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,160
it's not an inherently

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,920
biological uh variable in the US these

218
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,440
are typically uh taken from

219
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,880
standardized um variables from say the

220
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,680
sense from the US government om Office

221
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,160
of Management and budget uh from the

222
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,959
Census uh where we tend to get a lot of

223
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,040
these data from the health systems or uh

224
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,240
ethn Unity where we have two categories

225
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,640
in the US Hispanic or Latino Or nonh

226
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,600
Hispanic or

227
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,480
Latino so in thinking about disparities

228
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,440
many of us have started to consider that

229
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,920
we want to understand how people are

230
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,760
related to each other biologically

231
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,600
perhaps a better lens to look at this

232
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,800
through is one of genetic ancestry so we

233
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,200
can take the genetic data from

234
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
individuals in our studies and infer

235
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
genetic ancestry based on reference

236
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,120
population um and look at how similar

237
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
those individuals we're studying are are

238
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,760
to reference po uh individuals in a

239
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,360
reference database and use this ref uh

240
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,600
reference genetic ancestry or genetic

241
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,160
similarity as the basis of grouping

242
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,560
people together and then determining how

243
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,240
that relates to various cancer

244
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,000
phenotypes and so my group um

245
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,000
particularly studies um ancestry

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,079
affecting cancer and uses that as a

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,600
foundational framework organizing

248
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,920
principle to look at how the social

249
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,360
environmental and lifestyle exposure

250
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,079
interact with our underlying ancestry

251
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,079
related genetics and biology and uh

252
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,560
manifest as cancer disparities in in in

253
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,240
the

254
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
phenotypes um the basis of this work

255
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,800
which I don't have time to go through

256
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,839
this Mo this afternoon is some of our

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,160
earlier work some of work I did as a

258
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,680
postu with people some of the

259
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
investigators who are here at the broad

260
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,200
is um

261
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,760
when here in the tcga atlas in the pan

262
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,760
cancer Atlas phase in

263
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,000
20189 thereabouts we did exactly this we

264
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,200
inferred genetic ancestry from the

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,639
germline data in the tcga cohort and

266
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,000
then we looked at how that ancestry

267
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,519
correlated with uh somatic phenotypes in

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,800
cancer so here for example this is work

269
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:01,040
led by uh Gian Kang who's now at mskcc

270
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,320
where she showed here for example that

271
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,440
uh somatic alteration frequencies in

272
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,720
particular genes in pan cancer Atlas we

273
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,639
saw elevated mutations somatic

274
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,760
alteration frequencies in these three

275
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,480
genes and then specific alteration

276
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,079
frequencies in kidney cancer and vhl

277
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,680
pbm1 and bladder cancer and uh a couple

278
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:26,760
of other genes specific to East Asian

279
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,519
ancestry so there is a basis of seeing

280
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Mo molecular traits so sematic

281
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,839
alterations at various levels of

282
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,639
biological organization whether it's

283
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,519
somatic mutations expression um gene

284
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:44,160
expression alterations that are related

285
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:47,000
to ancestry cancer uh that could play a

286
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,000
role in manifesting in in our

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,639
investigating in our investigations of

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,040
ancestry related traits driving uh

289
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:00,920
cancer phenotypes in disparities related

290
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,040
work what is confusing is that um in

291
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,519
this work both concepts of race and

292
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,199
ancestry play a role and feed into the

293
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,839
health status and I found this schematic

294
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:16,399
by Tim rebik to be particularly

295
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:20,240
insightful because both our racial and

296
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,880
ethnic identity and our ancestry have

297
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,680
distinct and interrelated impacts on

298
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,120
health status so in essence the

299
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,240
underlying ancestry relates to biologic

300
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,639
iCal attributes that contribute to the

301
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,839
genomic architecture of an individual at

302
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:43,279
Birth and those biological int

303
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,399
attributes that are in uh influenced by

304
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,240
inherited

305
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,880
genetics and the lifetime

306
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,720
exposures uh uh elicited on our epig

307
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:59,199
genome jointly contributes to our health

308
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,600
status right but our lifetime exposure

309
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,560
and our experiences over the course of

310
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,680
our lifetime which contribute to us

311
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,360
developing cancer are also impacted by

312
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,639
our race ethnicity because they

313
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,360
influence where we live what we eat who

314
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,079
we interact with and our lived

315
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,920
experience of the world that's

316
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:20,920
translated into a biology via say for

317
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,680
example epigenetic mechanisms so it's

318
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,560
actually quite a gnarly ball of yarn to

319
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,199
uncouple and un twist really to to tease

320
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,240
apart the relative impact of ancestry

321
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:36,600
race ethnicity in driving different

322
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,440
cancer phenotypes um that can contribute

323
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,880
to disparities and so the organizing

324
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,480
principle of my lab is to um uh analyze

325
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,800
a computational biologist is to analyze

326
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,560
molecular profiling data sets multiomic

327
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,120
profiling data sets from cancer cohorts

328
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,079
to try and infer prognostic markers or

329
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,360
predict clinically useful end points

330
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,519
through a race of race ethnicity and

331
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,440
ancestry and determine sort of the

332
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,079
biological and genetic factors that

333
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,000
contributes to cancer Health disparities

334
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,959
so this is our current mission statement

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,839
as a lab uh we ask questions like what

336
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,600
are the genetic and molecular features

337
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,320
that drive cancer disparities uh does

338
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
this lead us to a mechanistic

339
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,000
understanding of cancer

340
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,040
disparities uh and can we build better

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,440
models for prediction and ultimately can

342
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,040
we identify novel therapeutic targets

343
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,079
uh that's the end goal I'm going to give

344
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,079
an example of a cancer type we work on

345
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,360
today uh for the in the interest of time

346
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,199
endometrial cancer is one of the tumor

347
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,839
types we're focused on it's particularly

348
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,839
interesting to me and um um going to

349
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,360
give a call to action for those of us

350
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,199
who are here and if you're online please

351
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,399
come work on inom metrial cancer

352
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:57,680
everybody it is a rising Global epidemic

353
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,839
which somehow no one seems to have heard

354
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,800
about um incidence and mortality of

355
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,600
endometrial cancer uterine cancers

356
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,920
broadly is rising across the board so we

357
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,360
have incidence data here and mortality

358
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,160
data on the right you can see that the

359
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,959
prevalence seems to be higher in higher

360
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,440
income countries although we see uh for

361
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,319
example here that mortality is also

362
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,160
generally high in low-income countries

363
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:28,680
uh but it's the uh rate data shows in a

364
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,360
steeper increase in low-income countries

365
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,360
I'm not not showing that data here early

366
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,319
work from uh people who are here

367
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,199
including G GS and andry CHC established

368
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:42,480
that um we have pathological

369
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,759
classification so classic histology like

370
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,279
endometroid subtypes or non- endomet

371
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,079
subtype by

372
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,720
histology and tumor grading associated

373
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:57,360
with particular somatic alterations like

374
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,759
tp53 mutations and establish a molecular

375
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,000
classification taxonomy as well which

376
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,919
lately has been integrated into clinical

377
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,280
treatment guidelines as of um a recent

378
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,640
release of the Figo classification in

379
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,600
this disease but what's particularly

380
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,360
concerning whereas other cancer types

381
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,280
the incidents and mortality is

382
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,520
decreasing slowly over time so we're

383
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,640
making progress for some reason in

384
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,559
endometrial cancers the opposite uh even

385
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,600
when we can when we adjust our

386
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,799
epidemiological estimates by rates of

387
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,799
hysterctomy in this

388
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:39,039
disease we see we are seeing that the

389
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,360
incidence rates uh for endometrial

390
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,559
cancer on the

391
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,440
rise and not

392
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,400
unsurprisingly the incidents and

393
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,320
mortality rates are increasing at an

394
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,400
even steeper Pace in women who

395
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,960
self-identify as black so the women who

396
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,520
black women have the steepest increase

397
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,080
in incidents of mortality and that tend

398
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,679
to get get the more most aggressive

399
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,840
molecular subtypes or molecular

400
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,600
histological subtypes that have uh less

401
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,000
treatment options that we don't

402
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,919
understand the Genesis of okay so one of

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,559
our research question is what's driving

404
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:21,400
this disparity in aggressive disease

405
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:25,520
presentation and uh like

406
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,440
many uh examples we lack the cohorts

407
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,720
that are rationally and ethnically

408
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,520
diverse that have have data that's

409
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,039
collected across all these domains that

410
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,120
we know are drivers of disparities so we

411
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,280
know what the problem is we know what

412
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,880
kind of data we need and we know who we

413
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,799
need it from but we don't have it okay

414
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,480
so that's where we are

415
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,320
today uh and so I present to you what

416
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,640
we're currently doing and where we'd

417
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,080
like to go so we got to start somewhere

418
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,760
we can't just sit around and say we

419
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,840
don't have anything so we can't do

420
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,320
anything so the first thing we're trying

421
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,640
is to leverage existing clinical

422
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,080
sequencing data we have uh I work at a

423
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,840
hospital we see patients and so we've uh

424
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,919
we're looking at retrospective cases uh

425
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,280
we're in a large metropolitan area of

426
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,240
New York greater New York Metro one of

427
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:23,120
the most diverse areas in in the country

428
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,799
and so uh here we have a cohort over the

429
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,400
last the defined area the last 10 years

430
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,520
it's around of people who were seen in

431
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,880
our Hospital who met the inclusion

432
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,120
criteria who also got clinical genome

433
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,760
sequencing done um in that cohort we're

434
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,000
seeing around 30% African ancestry

435
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,960
individuals we look at them by

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,840
hystological subtype we look at them

437
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,480
through ancestry and we try to correlate

438
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,080
these and try to understand if we see an

439
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,360
enrichment of specific mutations or

440
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,400
characteristics of their tumors uh with

441
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,919
ancestry Etc and then we're also uh

442
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,960
applying because we're part of the

443
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:06,159
hospital for access to their historic

444
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:09,039
historical residential uh addresses to

445
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,320
to be able to do geoc coding and then

446
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,559
use population or census data to get

447
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,159
access say to their income and use

448
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:21,280
indices of their socioeconomic status

449
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:25,400
population level indices to estimate

450
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:30,240
sort of their uh area level metrics of

451
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,400
of of of access or socio economic status

452
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,159
but we know from uh studies that were

453
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,720
shown so for example this was a new New

454
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:40,520
England

455
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,400
New New England Journal of Medicine

456
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,400
article that showed for example that uh

457
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,159
one of our most popular clinical genome

458
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,000
sequencing companies over 80% of the

459
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,880
people that have tested to this point

460
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,760
which was September

461
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,480
2022 were of European ancestry

462
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,640
so um we can do what we can do with what

463
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,400
we have but it's not going to be

464
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,960
sufficient we also leveraging this

465
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,000
institutional catchment area we're in

466
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,400
we're partnering with other local New

467
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,919
York area hospitals to build resources

468
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,799
like this New York polyethnic 1,000

469
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,159
cohort uh where the goal is

470
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:27,520
intentionally recruit um historically

471
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,919
excluded populations into these cancer

472
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,799
genome sequencing cohorts of which one

473
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,000
of them is for endometrial cancer the

474
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
pilot data is here where we show that

475
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,760
the vast majority of individuals that

476
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,559
were recruited in the study of African

477
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,000
antry and then a subset of this Cod is

478
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,520
endometrial cancer we're currently

479
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,799
analyzing that data now not authorized

480
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,480
to talk about it exactly and show you

481
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,039
but we're making significant progress

482
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,679
and help hope to have that data out um

483
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:59,520
later this year but the cohort size is

484
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,039
on the order of 100

485
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,240
also we can also do something with

486
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,320
what's available right now and so we're

487
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,279
also trying to take advantage of

488
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,000
population biobanks that are available

489
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,440
right so we have all of us um it's one

490
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,480
of those resources that actually has

491
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,360
genetic socioeconomic environmental

492
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,640
clinical all these different drivers of

493
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,679
disparity uh type data that's there and

494
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,880
so we've started working um industrious

495
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:35,159
ly I would say my team is uh on defining

496
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,480
case control cohorts in all of us people

497
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,600
with cancer with endometrial cancer

498
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,520
admittedly the case count is low

499
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,799
depending on how strict you are with

500
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,000
your case definition anywhere on the

501
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:52,360
order of 400 to 1,000 but if you

502
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,120
consider that the tcga cods our own

503
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,440
institutional cohorts are in that realm

504
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,159
this almost doubles the number of uh

505
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,240
germline in metrial cancers that are in

506
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,000
the in the public domain and then here

507
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,640
we're defining Concepts that are both

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,159
genetic and social determinance data

509
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,400
we're using the survey data as well as

510
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:18,919
clinically abstracted data from the EMR

511
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,120
and building uh integrated uh um machine

512
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,600
learning models to predict endometrial

513
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,640
cancer status ultimately we want to

514
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,880
predict risk we want to build risk

515
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,320
models uh but we're still it's still

516
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,240
early days for us here I would

517
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,760
say these three paths I would say are an

518
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,679
imperfect solution because these data

519
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,720
were not collected fit for purpose and

520
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,880
so I think what's on the horizon for us

521
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,080
that's the most exciting is being part

522
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,559
of the recently funded cancer Grand

523
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,000
Challenge team the uh the cancer

524
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,960
iniquities team titled team sambai

525
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,159
societal ancestry and molecular biology

526
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,559
analysis of inequities um very excited

527
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,600
about this work this work is being led

528
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:08,440
by Dr Melissa Davis at moha school of

529
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,440
medicine basically from everything I've

530
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,799
told you so far it's centering um the

531
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,200
African ancestry African diaspora and

532
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,240
then looking through all through putting

533
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,279
that at the center of the lens and

534
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,919
looking at all these aspects that we

535
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,559
know Drive disparities in a fit for

536
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,919
purpose way uh the planned recruitment

537
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:33,240
for this project

538
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:37,279
is the US the UK and sites throughout

539
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:41,279
Africa uh germline tumor normal match

540
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,919
sequencing RNA SE long read any sort of

541
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,640
state-of-the-art technology in the right

542
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,760
population with the right study design

543
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:54,200
with all the right um known risk

544
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:58,039
factors uh straight from the jump but

545
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,880
this is a five-year project so um we're

546
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:04,679
what 3 months in so very exciting but uh

547
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,080
this just goes to show that in solving

548
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,960
and tackling a complex problem like this

549
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,200
we have to start from somewhere so we

550
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,720
start with where we are but we know

551
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,080
where we need to go and projects like

552
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,120
this are where we where things really

553
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,000
need to go intentional study design

554
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,080
intentional recruitment in the right

555
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,120
target

556
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,240
populations and so in essence um we want

557
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,159
to focus on peas ing apart the

558
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,880
biological and genetic determinance of

559
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,480
disparities asking the right questions

560
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,880
and that's it in a nutshell looking

561
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,600
forward to our conversation we cannot do

562
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,799
this work alone I want to acknowledge my

563
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,080
group who working very hard we have an

564
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,760
army of collaborators that we're working

565
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,320
with um all the sources of funding

566
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,159
support and today I especially want to

567
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,279
acknowledge somebody very important to

568
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:02,120
me my postdoctoral mental passed away um

569
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:05,559
earlier this year uh it's particularly

570
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,840
impacting me this week because um the

571
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,960
memorial simposium celebrating his

572
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,399
life's work and his contribution to

573
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,960
scientist this weekend on Saturday and I

574
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:19,279
put that um Link in there uh there will

575
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,000
be a uh the Symposium will be streamed

576
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,420
live as well it's on Saturday uh so

577
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:34,130
thank you for your attention

578
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:34,130
[Applause]

pleas thank you Nasha for your

582
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:45,720
presentation um we're now going to move

583
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,240
on to a firesight chat

584
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,240
portion um with Dr Alicia Martin our

585
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,600
very own she is an assistant

Stanley Center for psychiatric research

592
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,840
on the medical and population genetics

593
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,840
program as a population of statistical

594
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,919
geneticists her research examines the

595
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,640
role of human history in shaping Global

596
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,039
genetic and phenotypic diversity given

597
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,960
vast eurocentric study biases she

598
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,880
investigates the general

599
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,120
generalizability oh my goodness

600
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,240
generalizability of knowledge gained

601
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,320
from large scale genetic studies across

602
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
globally diverse populations she's

603
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,480
particularly focused on ensuring that

604
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,000
the translation of genetic Technologies

605
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,200
via penic risk does not exacerbate

606
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,519
Health disparities induced by those

607
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,640
study biases towards this end she is

608
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,600
developing statistical methods Community

609
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Resources vir genomics and research

610
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,919
capacity for multi-ancestry studies

611
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,640
particularly in

612
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,039
underrepresented

613
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,840
populations take away

614
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,919
thank thank you for giving the

615
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,519
opportunity to have a conversation with

616
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,159
such an esteemed lovely call here um and

617
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,320
thank you so much for all of your work

618
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,600
on these disparities I think they're so

619
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,519
incredibly challenging to disentangle so

620
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,200
hard to understand um want to start also

621
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,519
with my condolences for the loss of your

622
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,440
Mentor I'm sure that that is a huge loss

623
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:19,240
in in the field

624
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,480
um I want to kind of start big picture

625
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,519
and thinking about these disparities and

626
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,760
having this chat with you because you're

627
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,360
interested in the biological you're

628
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,320
interested in the genetics so you're

629
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,559
interested in the mechanism but it's

630
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,880
really hard to start at that level when

631
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,480
there's so much ins sconed in our

632
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,360
society and in how you know structural

633
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,080
racism is impacting disparities

634
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,600
including through access to healthare so

635
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,799
first I want to start with um how do the

636
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,960
disparities that you're describing and

637
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:54,200
that you're researching relate to who

638
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,840
can get care how easily can they get

639
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,200
care and also related to trust in

640
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,279
mainstream medicine

641
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,799
all right um thank you um uh before I

642
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,519
answer the question I also want to thank

643
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,799
you for your work in this field I think

644
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,200
um in getting to this field and tackling

645
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,919
some of this work reading some of your

646
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,240
early work on um CH and and and

647
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,039
representation there was also insightful

648
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,600
in in in US thinking about what we think

649
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,279
about and and getting to where we are as

650
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,600
well

651
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:33,159
um I think uh fundamentally

652
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,279
speaking who I think that slide from the

653
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:39,200
um

654
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:41,120
NM perspective was very telling right so

655
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,080
we've done all this work in the genomic

656
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,919
field to figure out the cancer drivers

657
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,200
so we're going to find all the drivers

658
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,240
and find what's mutated and then find a

659
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,600
targeted uh treatment and and administer

660
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,399
Precision oncology but we have this

661
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:01,480
fundamental issue where um most some

662
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,679
people aren't even getting the test okay

663
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,480
and so even if there is a drug they

664
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,919
can't get it um uh I trained on the you

665
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,200
know on the side of the analysis and

666
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:18,120
identifying the mutations and getting to

667
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,679
what drugs we need to make against which

668
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,320
which targets and I I didn't fully

669
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:28,679
consider the ramifications of what if

670
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,679
somebody didn't get the test uh and so

671
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:34,760
now that we're here um I'm having to

672
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,080
really take the time to educate myself

673
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,440
about these issues and consider the

674
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,159
wider ranging impact of that and I think

675
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,279
it comes uh it comes back to a question

676
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:49,360
a discussion we having earlier here

677
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,640
today uh with colleagues that I don't

678
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,720
feel like I'm an expert in Access issues

679
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:00,080
and you know who Etc but as a practicing

680
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,039
scientist I have to be informed and I

681
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,240
have to be aware of the science we're

682
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,240
doing has an impact in society and so

683
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,360
being more mindful about communicating

684
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,080
what we do outside of my realm outside

685
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,720
of my genomics colleagues uh talking to

686
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:21,639
people um I think at the recent aacr

687
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,279
disparities meeting uh it became clear

688
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:27,960
that a platform for um Advocate Patient

689
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,919
Advocates and advocacy in general for

690
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,440
scientists is important because that

691
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,600
message needs to go out to these

692
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,039
communities so that people understand

693
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,039
what it is we're doing what what genetic

694
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,200
testing means what it what it means so

695
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,919
that it becomes part of everyday

696
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,279
language part of the everyday lexicon so

697
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,159
that if you're in your physician asks

698
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,480
you to be part of a

699
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:54,720
study um it's it's not something um I

700
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,960
believe a patient advocate called it um

701
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,159
you know you're not you're not a guinea

702
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,360
pig in a study right to be part of a

703
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,880
clinical trial or so there is um there

704
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,799
is some responsibility on as a scientist

705
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:12,080
to Advocate a little bit and to

706
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:15,000
communicate our science more widely so

707
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,480
that uh what we

708
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,440
do it has has a wider impact and uh

709
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,960
influences legislation which in turn

710
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,559
will lead to changes in who has access

711
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,240
what gets paid for and and then who is

712
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,240
repres

713
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,080
ultimately absolutely I feel like it's a

714
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,960
cycle that we all need to kind of play a

715
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,960
role in especially as scientists

716
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,799
understanding the data on the

717
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,559
communication angle um you know science

718
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,480
communication to marginalized groups is

719
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,960
very important so on that

720
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,480
topic beyond the analytical work that

721
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,880
your group is doing you mentioned vested

722
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,240
interest in the science communication

723
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,360
piece what is your lab doing and Beyond

724
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,639
the scope of the analyses to try to sort

725
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,120
of bring everybody along and make sure

726
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:04,679
that people don't feel like guinea pigs

727
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,799
when it comes to such a massive kind of

728
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,679
life or death kind of decision as what

729
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,799
kind of treatment you get yeah

730
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:14,639
admittedly um I don't know that we have

731
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:16,919
formal things we're doing as a lab and

732
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,960
as the lab head that falls directly on

733
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,440
me I

734
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,240
am a shy

735
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,840
person believe it or not so I'm like as

736
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,080
soon as these lights go off I'd like to

737
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,840
run out that door um it's it's hard and

738
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,399
um I've been thinking of uh getting

739
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,360
maybe more formal

740
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,080
training uh or actually yeah seeking out

741
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,120
maybe more formal training and building

742
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:47,399
even just a five minute Spiel a one

743
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:51,320
minute Spiel that I can use to to to to

744
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:54,200
to communicate these things um I would

745
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,880
like to be better at social media I've

746
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,039
reached out to our social media

747
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,440
department and they have every

748
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:04,440
institution has resources right where um

749
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,840
our our Communications team have

750
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,440
professionals you know we we we are

751
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,000
professionals at this we have

752
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,399
professionals at that who can actually

753
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,720
help you you can meet with them explain

754
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,440
what you do and they can help you create

755
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,079
packages um I have a younger sister who

756
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,639
is much more facile at technology than I

757
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:27,079
am and she schedules her social media

758
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,040
posts and stuff I was like oh looking

759
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,280
over her shoulder like oh could you

760
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,359
could you help me do that cuz the other

761
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,399
thing I'll say is oh I don't have time

762
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,560
and then she's like well you could

763
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,399
schedule the post I was like oh is that

764
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,320
a thing okay so um I think yeah bringing

765
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,960
more intentionality to it is is

766
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,879
definitely something do that point I

767
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,560
mean also to your credit this is

768
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,839
something that you want to do but as

769
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,280
with many folks in this room I'm sure we

770
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,200
don't have time for all the things that

771
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,359
we would necessarily like to do and

772
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,960
there are Communications experts and

773
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:02,800
their advocacy groups and playing a role

774
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,680
at liasing between these communication

775
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,119
experts and advocacy groups seems like

776
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,480
something we might consider as

777
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,000
scientists who deeply understand the

778
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,160
data and deeply understand some of these

779
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,119
bases of disparities um is that

780
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,440
something you might consider in the

781
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,040
future for sure

782
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,800
awesome um I wanted to come back to this

783
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,040
idea of the environment so it's you know

784
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,520
such a big topic right we're all very

785
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,079
curious and excited about the

786
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,839
environment and and I'm coming sort of

787
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,119
from like a bit of a gwos perspective

788
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,400
where like we're

789
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,560
doing massive genomic studies all the

790
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,720
time um but to the points on some of

791
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,000
your slides some of these types of omix

792
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,760
data don't require hundreds of thousands

793
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,079
of people to be particularly meaningful

794
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,160
to patients so I'm curious about um some

795
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,800
of the like cancer risk projects that

796
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,560
you're contemplating and that you're

797
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,800
working on and particularly in low and

798
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,160
middle inome countries where scaling

799
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,200
multiomic data maybe a particular

800
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,119
challenge um what are you thinking about

801
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,160
the utility of some of these omix data

802
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,640
to play a role in both understanding the

803
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,040
like molecular profiling nature of

804
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,280
cancer but also to potentially Bridge a

805
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,839
gap with our understanding of the

806
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,280
environment and social determinance of

807
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,240
health and maybe trying to build some

808
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,480
causal models that can we can use as a

809
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,119
framework to try to understand how these

810
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,000
different pieces all kind of fit

811
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,119
together

812
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,040
excuse me I'll um I'll give you a sec to

813
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,440
to think about that and just get some

814
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,359
water but

815
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,000
um for example we're helping build

816
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,560
biomarkers from proteomic data on the

817
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,040
basis of smoking which is obviously a

818
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,000
big risk factor for lung cancer for

819
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,839
example are you thinking about these

820
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,400
kinds of things where are you excited

821
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:50,960
about the field going on the cancer

822
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,960
disparities

823
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,760
topic sorry yes you're

824
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,119
good no this is an exciting uh the

825
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,640
exciting Point set of point to bring out

826
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,520
especially on the issue of scale right

827
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,119
because we can't all be part of these

828
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:10,680
large consortia that have a billion

829
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,560
dollars to do 20,000 samples right and I

830
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,640
think this goes back a little bit to

831
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,680
what I was saying about practicality

832
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,839
like what can we do today we all have a

833
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,920
collaborator who has some number of

834
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,079
samples and so the question is what can

835
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
we do with what we have right now and

836
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,400
how can that help and and I really like

837
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,200
this example you gave about smoking

838
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,960
right um I think the other ohms like

839
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,119
expression proteome metabolome uh

840
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:45,680
potentially have informative information

841
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,880
there that uh really gets at biomarkers

842
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,560
really gets at uh doing something

843
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,280
getting to a place where you could

844
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,040
design a low cost test or screening

845
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,319
diagnostic uh very quickly

846
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,920
uh and so things like that are very

847
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:07,760
exciting I did my PhD in DNA methylation

848
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,240
based subtyping in cancer and DNA

849
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,880
methylation will always be my first love

850
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,720
and I've been doing a lot of thinking

851
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,640
lately about um reading a lot too about

852
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,079
uh the epig genome as a mechanism of

853
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:23,079
embedding of environmental exposures and

854
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,960
thinking a lot too about genetic

855
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:30,560
regulation of DNA methylation and so

856
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,359
tring ulating across those um some

857
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,079
there's some thought been given by other

858
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,359
people of building metalation risk

859
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,680
scores as indicators of the general

860
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,359
environmental

861
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,200
exposure uh signature as well so sort of

862
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,760
a fingerprint of where you've been and

863
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,720
how it's been going so there's lots of

864
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,800
little areas like that that you could

865
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,240
probably get started pretty

866
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,880
quickly one thing too I like about the

867
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,359
EP genome is that you're using DNA and

868
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,359
um with all Logistics and

869
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:04,000
fixation uh that has you know the

870
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,880
potential to stay a bit more stable over

871
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,200
time and across conditions which might

872
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,560
be a challenge in some type of

873
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,880
environment so there's there are some

874
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,440
room there uh for exciting developments

875
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,599
definitely and one of the areas that you

876
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,839
were talking about was an endometrial

877
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,400
cancer this sort of explosion and

878
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,720
prevalence that we might expect during

879
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,040
the um next few decades and I'm

880
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,800
wondering if there is a good

881
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,319
understanding of what the exposures are

882
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,599
that are potentially going to lead to

883
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,839
that explosion and whether there are

884
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:39,760
some omix data that might help um tag

885
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,960
those because that's an interesting and

886
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,880
exciting area I think the biggest risk

887
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:51,359
factor that people the biggest um driver

888
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:55,000
of that rise is uh obesity uh and other

889
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,920
metabolic syndrome and so just like in

890
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,440
general in the world everything related

891
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,960
or you know triangulating with the

892
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,280
Obesity epidemic in the world is is is

893
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,760
converging there um and then there is

894
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,760
hormonal exposures as well of of two big

895
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:17,880
things that are also potentially easy to

896
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:22,640
measure um there is potential to

897
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,720
intervene uh but I think it's feels

898
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,760
wrong to sit here and say oh yeah

899
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,760
obesity is easy to tackle because if was

900
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,560
we would have gotten there already you

901
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,359
know yeah similarly on the hormonal side

902
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,000
I'm sure there are some hormone blockers

903
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:41,119
but I'm sure also that impacts a whole

904
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,520
system not just a single component of

905
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,480
your risk I think one of the challenges

906
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,359
in endometrial cancer that it's

907
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,359
relatively understudied right and so

908
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:53,440
what we thought for example uh there was

909
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,160
like type one type two this one is

910
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,760
homono driven this one is not it turns

911
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,880
out that it's not quite that's

912
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,000
simplified or that uh one or the other

913
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,520
and there of course it's always a

914
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,440
Continuum uh and so just having more

915
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,640
directed attention and more rigorous

916
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,920
study will will will be important

917
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,280
awesome well I'm looking forward to

918
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,880
seeing your role in that um kind of the

919
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,880
general question again zooming out that

920
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,400
we were kind of discussing is where do

921
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,560
you start with your research you're

922
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,280
exploring such a massive space and what

923
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,480
what determines which questions you want

924
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:34,599
to be really going after for example

925
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,079
some genes have known cancer drivers

926
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,680
associated with them do you start by

927
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,319
looking at those drivers and in those

928
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,720
specific cancers or do you take kind of

929
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:42,720
an unbiased approach and if so

930
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,640
how maybe that's a tough question it's

931
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:51,040
it is a pretty tough question um it

932
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,119
depends it depends on the project it

933
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,760
depends on the focus and so um when I

934
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,760
started my lab I think it also depends

935
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,119
where you are in your career right so

936
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,680
some projects are longer term investment

937
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,640
right so you start you you want to take

938
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,440
an unbiased approach and you plan the

939
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,160
study well and it takes how long it

940
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,040
takes right and uh some projects are

941
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,960
student driven and they have to graduate

942
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,680
in two years so you design a project

943
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,520
where you've um got a a fair idea of

944
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,040
where it's going and the it's an interim

945
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,800
objective to the longer term objective

946
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,440
so you're more focused you want you have

947
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,839
a specific hypothesis about a particular

948
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,920
pathway and that project is constrained

949
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:41,720
to that pathway so then um uh then that

950
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,359
that's what determines whether you focus

951
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,520
on specific genes or specific

952
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:50,400
Pathways

953
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,040
um you so I'm I'm looking at the

954
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,319
presenter screen it's still showing my

955
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,280
mentor and one thing he always used to

956
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,359
say was um let the science lead you so I

957
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,720
think I I should stop

958
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:04,480
talking that sounds like wise advice for

959
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,440
all of us

960
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,000
yeah

961
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,200
um I want to turn to sort of a question

962
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,559
that's kind of near and dear to my

963
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,480
research and our shared interests which

964
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,599
is um the topic of ancestry so you I

965
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,359
think gave like a really nice outline of

966
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,720
the delineations between race ethnicity

967
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:30,079
and ancestry so I just wanted to start

968
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,079
with when researchers are studying

969
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,240
cancer disparities whether that be in

970
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,960
incidents or

971
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:39,040
mortality do they use just to reiterate

972
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,920
ancestry or self-identified race or

973
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,400
ethnicity I would say they use

974
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,599
self-identified race or

975
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,480
ethnicity particularly if it's

976
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,720
epidemiological data uh because of how

977
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,040
that data was collected

978
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,200
historically uh so for example the

979
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,880
surveillance database that's maintained

980
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,680
by the National Cancer Institute

981
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,319
um the surveillance database that

982
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,720
maintains that data collects that data

983
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,200
uh using self-identified race um

984
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,280
self-identified rcio ethnicity yeah and

985
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,480
I guess that's something that you can

986
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
easily get from a cancer patient walking

987
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,839
in the door without a whole genome

988
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,079
sequence or without genetic data already

989
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:18,200
generated so when you're doing cancer

990
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,160
genomic

991
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,000
analysis are you

992
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,119
using ancestry or using race or using

993
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,599
ethnicity or some combination of

994
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,559
these I would say in looking at it from

995
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,559
An ancestry perspective is fairly

996
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,559
new

997
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,440
um I

998
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,079
think I'm trying to remember when I

999
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,040
start when I first started seeing papers

1000
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,599
looking at it from their perspective but

1001
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:52,800
I think for a long time in cancer

1002
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:55,240
genomics we looked at the cohort as you

1003
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,760
know this cohort as this tumor type and

1004
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,760
these mutations and didn't consider

1005
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,830
necessarily racial

1006
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,760
ethnicity

1007
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:06,720
[Music]

1008
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,200
um yeah and then um for a long time then

1009
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,720
when people who studied disparities

1010
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,240
would compare mutations they would

1011
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,200
compare the rate of mutations between

1012
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,000
groups defined by self-identified race

1013
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,839
or

1014
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,359
ethnicity then people started asking

1015
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:24,240
what's why would you what is the

1016
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,800
rationale of for expecting

1017
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,160
differences from groups that are defined

1018
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,160
by self identity self-identification so

1019
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,400
then it's like oh right if it's a social

1020
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:39,160
construct can you expect that you'd see

1021
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,920
differences in mutation then if you see

1022
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,559
differences in mutation by those groups

1023
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,359
that are defined by socially defined

1024
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,200
variables is it that is it the social

1025
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,000
definition or what's genetically similar

1026
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,400
between those two be those two groups so

1027
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,800
that's I think how sort of it converged

1028
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,480
to oh maybe we should Define the groups

1029
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,760
by genetic ancestry then if we see

1030
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,079
differences then we can we can know that

1031
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,359
these differences are genetically D

1032
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,160
driven right I guess you have like a bit

1033
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:11,480
of a chicken and egg kind of problem

1034
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,119
when you're trying to understand and

1035
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,119
tease apart these disparities because if

1036
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,839
you're doing a germline genetic study

1037
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:19,280
differences in a Le frequency that

1038
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,520
you're identifying you want to make sure

1039
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,839
that you're controlling for ancestry

1040
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,559
however if you're then looking at driver

1041
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:30,359
mutation differences maybe that differs

1042
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,520
as a consequence of a whole lived

1043
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:36,160
experience and maybe that's a little bit

1044
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:38,200
more social so at some level I see

1045
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,760
utility and having both of these when

1046
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,599
trying to understand and study

1047
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,119
disparities as they relate to the genome

1048
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,079
whether it be germ lineer somatic in

1049
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,960
this context oh yeah I don't know if we

1050
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,440
have the kind of time to delve into it

1051
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,960
but I've been thinking about this and

1052
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,160
maybe you're the right person to to to

1053
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,240
because in a g was right you add all

1054
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,319
your ad mixture coefficients rate to

1055
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:06,000
control for the effect of

1056
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:08,880
ancestry um to find Snips linked to your

1057
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,359
trait but what if your trait is

1058
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:20,000
inherently ancestry it or okay h no your

1059
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:22,640
trait is the disease but you can so you

1060
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,520
can take two approaches right you can do

1061
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,119
the GS in each group independently but

1062
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,280
then you're losing power because you

1063
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:34,960
don't have that many samples from the

1064
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,800
non-european ancestry group yeah there's

1065
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,800
there's a lot to do the part yeah that's

1066
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,079
a tricky one when you so for the gws you

1067
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:45,040
want to make sure that you're accounting

1068
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:49,079
for ancestry to ensure that you know any

1069
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:52,160
IL like effect on the disease is larger

1070
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,280
in say cases compared to controls versus

1071
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,680
background

1072
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,640
expectation but then when you're getting

1073
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,079
to what what's what is the driver of

1074
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,559
some of these cancer differences and

1075
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,280
you're bringing in all of these social

1076
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,800
and environmental contributions

1077
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,680
structural racism Access to Health Care

1078
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,680
obesity hormonal regulation all of or

1079
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,319
hormone

1080
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,319
exposures there's so much there that can

1081
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,000
also influence does someone get cancer

1082
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,440
in the first place so bringing these two

1083
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
things together both of them are

1084
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,640
impacting The genome in some way right

1085
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,400
so I've seen so some strategies people

1086
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,280
started to employ for example but it

1087
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,480
it's also circular so let me put it this

1088
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,960
way you can say for example use a PRS to

1089
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:40,040
control for the genetic effect right if

1090
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:42,920
you have a PRS that works well across

1091
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:46,160
all groups defined by ancestry you can

1092
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,720
add that to your model to ask given that

1093
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,359
you have this genetic background do

1094
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,119
these social effects have play a role in

1095
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,200
contributing to the

1096
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:59,799
disease that's that's makes a lot of

1097
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:03,559
sense one approach uh in endometrial

1098
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:09,400
cancer there's been one very big

1099
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:12,319
G um I I I'm unsure where's the camera I

1100
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,799
am unsure whether that PRS Works equally

1101
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,799
well across all

1102
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,200
groups well I think you and I could talk

1103
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,839
about this topic all day um but to

1104
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,720
broaden the conversation so other folks

1105
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:26,520
in the room I know will be also really

1106
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,799
interested I want to also talk a little

1107
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,880
bit bit about the all of us uh work that

1108
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:35,799
you're doing particularly because that's

1109
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:38,640
such an amazing biobank that's us-wide

1110
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:40,280
and it also is intended to boost

1111
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,200
representation from traditionally

1112
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,680
underrepresented groups in biomedical

1113
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,839
research um so how much information is

1114
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,960
encoded in all of us that is useful for

1115
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:51,920
us to dig into trying to understand some

1116
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,760
of the root causes of cancer disparities

1117
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,319
I think as designed uh all of us is one

1118
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,200
of those unique resources that is

1119
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,440
optimally designed to help us to tease

1120
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,319
apart some of the questions we have

1121
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,960
about disparities uh in general about

1122
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:12,799
diseases in general uh for cancer it's

1123
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,440
it works well it has one small drawback

1124
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:16,400
in that there we don't have too much

1125
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,799
genome sequencing but we do have

1126
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,680
germline sequencing data there and then

1127
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:22,839
we have all the social and some

1128
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,440
environmental data and then we have all

1129
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:27,040
the clinical data from that you can

1130
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,400
extract from emrs and wonder if there

1131
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,000
are going to be future researchers that

1132
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,480
are like this is a gap we need to fill

1133
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,200
we're going to go sequence those tumors

1134
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,280
too right I'm I'm I'm not sure in the

1135
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,599
road map if the tumor samples were

1136
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,400
collected but that would if that was

1137
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,799
there then it would be it would be yeah

1138
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,680
gold mine I would certainly sign up for

1139
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:48,839
ex

1140
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,599
definitely um what else in the all of us

1141
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,960
sort of data would be amazing to have

1142
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:53,960
when I know for example from working

1143
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,400
with biobanks that cancer registry

1144
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,920
information can be a little limited

1145
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,640
including with things like stage and

1146
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,880
histology and that sort of thing yeah

1147
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,640
definitely I think for for cancer

1148
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,760
utility having more of the pathology

1149
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:09,640
type information would be ideal so

1150
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:14,040
having more uh his uh pathology

1151
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:17,079
confirmed histology staging and then an

1152
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:20,640
easier way to get Survival and update on

1153
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:23,480
Survival outcomes would be like icing on

1154
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,280
the cake nice so good to have but you've

1155
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:30,079
got a starting point already right great

1156
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,079
um kind of on that topic since all of us

1157
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,160
has whole genome sequencing data what

1158
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,000
information can you learn about

1159
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,319
someone's likelihood of having cancer

1160
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,839
what type of cancer they might have from

1161
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:42,000
their whole genome sequencing data

1162
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:43,280
germine data alone and then relatedly

1163
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,359
what other pieces of information would

1164
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,200
be really valuable to have from if if

1165
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:51,480
you just had the home whole genome data

1166
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,200
alone uh you could not determine whether

1167
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:56,960
a person had cancer or not but you could

1168
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,319
determine the risk of having cancer uh

1169
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,920
based on uh triangulating the whole

1170
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:06,119
genome data with uh known with databases

1171
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,000
with known pathogenic germline variants

1172
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:12,079
especially those in highly

1173
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,440
penetrant uh uh germline uh cancer

1174
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,000
predisposition genes uh so for example

1175
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,839
again I'm just going to use endometrial

1176
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
cancer today I do know about other

1177
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:25,839
cancer types um we have cancer

1178
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,400
predisposition syndromes like uh um the

1179
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,680
Lynch syndrome which um predisposes you

1180
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,440
to endometrial and colon cancer so you

1181
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,119
have a defined set of genes that you

1182
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:38,599
know pathogenic varant and these genes

1183
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:43,000
leads to high uh likelihood of getting

1184
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:45,000
endometrial colon cancer um we can also

1185
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,359
uh again estimate the likelihood of

1186
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:53,599
developing that that Tuma type using a

1187
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:56,640
PRS a a polyenic risk score for that uh

1188
00:52:53,599 --> 00:53:01,119
for that for different cancer types um

1189
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,760
um we can um what else can we do oh we

1190
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,200
can look at the structural variation

1191
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,079
data that would be very um very

1192
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,319
important to look at it at sort of large

1193
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,559
scale uh duplication or uh structural

1194
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:15,839
alterations in the genome though those

1195
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,880
would be very very telling and

1196
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:21,680
predictive but the I think the power the

1197
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,880
ultimate power of all of us comes from

1198
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:29,240
having multiple streams of different

1199
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:33,400
types of data to to to to to work with

1200
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:35,880
and also um this series is sort of co-

1201
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,520
co-run by the equity and biom Medicine

1202
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,640
series and also is being you know set up

1203
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,319
by women at Broad and so I want to turn

1204
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,680
a little bit to some Career Development

1205
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,200
question because of course you're

1206
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,599
running a lab you're working on cancer

1207
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:52,400
disparities your career trajectory seems

1208
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,440
like one that's fairly inspirational so

1209
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,960
can you tell us a little bit about the

1210
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,319
lab that you've built and what you look

1211
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,920
for in a team and any sort of career

1212
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:04,960
advice that you can lend to folks in the

1213
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:09,680
room right um so I've had my lab for uh

1214
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:12,640
two years 8 months 4 days three

1215
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:18,119
hours two yeah two and a half years give

1216
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:22,799
or take um and um it's it's I love it I

1217
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:25,760
I really love it I love my group um uh I

1218
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:28,280
think there are many things that one

1219
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,119
could do with the PhD this is one of

1220
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:37,720
them

1221
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:41,440
um I love uh I I I love the work we do

1222
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:45,839
it's hard sometimes it's fun sometimes

1223
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,760
it's a lot of things um and so uh I come

1224
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,440
from a background of team sports so when

1225
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,880
I was building my team I really thought

1226
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,400
about how uh a lot about those

1227
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,880
principles of how everyone on the team

1228
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,960
team we're all working to one goal we

1229
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:06,559
want to win uh whatever you know how you

1230
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:10,559
define win publish the papers eradicate

1231
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:14,079
cancer um um Advance our careers

1232
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:17,880
individually and collectively uh but not

1233
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:20,640
everyone uh is is is the same because if

1234
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,280
we're all the same like let's take for

1235
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,480
example a basketball team if we were all

1236
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,440
tall then nobody could shoot or if if we

1237
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,000
were all dribbling the ball up then

1238
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,760
nobody could get the rebound so it's you

1239
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,079
know it's really been so far the first

1240
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,920
few people who've joined the team they

1241
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:42,119
are not all the exact same phenotype and

1242
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,200
so I think there's been strength in

1243
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,280
numbers in that way and that we don't

1244
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:50,319
have a single person who can do we don't

1245
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,839
have any single copy of the same

1246
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:56,760
person that makes a lot of sense um I

1247
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:59,079
guess building on that

1248
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,920
you know what advice do you have for

1249
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:02,799
trainees who are going out and are

1250
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:07,160
thinking about what their next steps are

1251
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:09,599
be that from a postback position or

1252
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,359
having done their PHD what comes next

1253
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,559
that was at least personally like a

1254
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:16,039
pretty existential kind of moment of

1255
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:17,880
self-reflection and it was really

1256
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:19,960
challenging and so I'm wondering how you

1257
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,319
came to your position how challenging it

1258
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,160
was to get to your position and do you

1259
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:24,839
have advice for those that might be

1260
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,760
thinking about what their next steps are

1261
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:30,880
in indeed it was I identify with that as

1262
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,200
well it was extremely challenging and uh

1263
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,280
it took a pandemic uh to bring the level

1264
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,880
of the self-examination that determined

1265
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,000
my course um so the first piece of

1266
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:45,920
advice I always give is to spend a

1267
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,160
significant amount of time in

1268
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,680
self-reflection to decide what makes

1269
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,839
sense for you there's a lot of advice

1270
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,799
that's going to be handed out to you

1271
00:56:52,839 --> 00:56:57,440
about what makes sense to other people

1272
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,559
what they would do uh what feels good

1273
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,839
for them what's right for their life

1274
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:04,200
which might not be right for your life

1275
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,119
the second thing is to talk to people so

1276
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,480
having the right team of mentors not one

1277
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,799
person you could have a primary Mentor a

1278
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,359
secondary Mentor but talk to as many

1279
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:16,480
people as possible you can have one

1280
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:18,920
question that you ask the say everyone

1281
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,880
that you talk to and different questions

1282
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,960
you ask to different people to try and

1283
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,880
get sort of a 360 Dee perspective on the

1284
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,960
issue um and then I think there's some

1285
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:34,440
level of serendipity to what happens as

1286
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,680
well where you are and um and then there

1287
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,440
is um just some encouragement for

1288
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,640
somebody who's out there who's in this

1289
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,079
place because there was a time where I

1290
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,280
would say I was really like I don't know

1291
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:48,920
where I'm going I don't know where this

1292
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,240
is going to be and now I guess 3 years

1293
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,319
down the road I'm sitting on the stage

1294
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,880
I'm apparently giving an expert talk I

1295
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,280
got a grant from the

1296
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,440
ni and so if you had asked me these

1297
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,760
questions three years ago I might not

1298
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,480
have been as perky about it because I

1299
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,559
was in a place where I thought I'm not

1300
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,039
sure this next step is exactly where

1301
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,440
this is going so I just want to

1302
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,319
encourage other people that at that

1303
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,359
moment it might not feel like things are

1304
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,400
going to turn out but just keep

1305
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:25,160
persevering you might just be in that

1306
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,799
last last dark space just before things

1307
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,599
turn bright

1308
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:31,400
and so I just want to yeah encourage

1309
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:34,079
somebody out there today great on the

1310
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,319
optimistic note of perseverance I think

00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,000
