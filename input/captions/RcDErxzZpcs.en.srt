14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,239
>> All right. So, so uh this of course does

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,079
not actually mean that you have more

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,840
time for assignment three. In fact, it

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,440
needs a little bit more time than for

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,480
assignment three. Sorry about that. But

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,600
I think this is a net game for everyone.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,239
Um all right, that with that out of the

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
way. Um Konamo actually a lot of you

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,800
probably are already familiar. You might

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,280
have taken any of her classes. She's uh

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,879
uh she's a visiting uh lecturer,

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,840
visiting professor. Visiting professor.

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,360
>> Um uh here at Gambit uh and um

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,080
>> are you doing something?

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
>> Yes. Cheating and ethics and games.

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,159
>> So this

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,119
>> Brian can tell you all about it.

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
>> You can take this as a the sneak

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,080
preview.

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,320
>> Yes. This is the taster of it.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,880
>> Thanks.

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,439
Okay. Um, so it sounds like you all have

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,560
lots of opinions,

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,640
which will be good. So to get started,

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
and actually I don't like the term

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,240
lecture because I don't actually lecture

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,240
very much. Um, I'm going to start by

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,640
handing around some online index cards,

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,680
and I want you to take a few minutes and

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,600
generate some examples of uh ethical

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,960
elements, procedures, episodes, games.

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
The more specific you can be, the

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,399
better. And I'm actually going to

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,320
collect these at the end um because as

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,240
Philip mentioned, I'm teaching this

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,399
ethics and games class and I want to

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,520
bring in more examples and stuff. So

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,200
this will actually be useful for me. So

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,039
>> talking about in games.

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
>> Yeah. So you like we were just talking

54
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,440
about Fable. Um, but like if you can

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
think of a more specific example from

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
it, a level, um, different choices that

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,239
you get with characters in certain

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
games,

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
whatever you can come up with in terms

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,599
of like are there interesting ethical

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,599
dilemmas,

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
situations?

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
>> Wait, is this within the context of the

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,920
game or are we talking about like in a

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
multiplayer game, your conduct towards

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
other players and this kind of thing?

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
>> Or when I was in Owen's office, whether

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,400
or not they steal the swag. um within

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,200
you can do within MMOs as well or you

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,200
know multiplayer game

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
>> you can continue to write examples for

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,760
hand uh if you can think of them but

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,920
just to get started um

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,360
you're going to stand behind me

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,840
>> well then you can start by giving me an

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
example

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,200
>> sure um okay so I have a couple um names

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,879
obviously um there's there's always kind

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,720
of questions and debate about whether

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,159
something it's cheap or viable or should

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,959
you be allowed to do it?

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,319
>> Oh

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,440
>> yeah. So like if maybe um

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm trying to think how to describe it.

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,440
So people who play casually will tend to

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,360
say um oh if you do this with this

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,840
character that's cheap and you shouldn't

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
do that. Whereas the you know the

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
community at large and people who play

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,799
seriously tend to say well if you can do

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
something you can't do something you

92
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,959
should be allowed to do it and if you

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,360
can't overcome it that's your own fault.

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,760
>> Okay. is like violating a community

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,879
norm.

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,959
>> Yeah, kind

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,720
>> like it's allowed in the rules,

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,720
>> but it's like against like the community

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,720
norm

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,879
that

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Evan Owen

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
>> Owen sorry

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,919
>> so I have a bunch of stuff which is

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,840
related to griefing just generally um so

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
let's just go for the one which is one

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,120
of my favorites

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,479
um so this is griefing for comic effects

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
or role playing griefing but doing it in

109
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,960
a way which you are then going to write

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,040
a blog about and from your character's

111
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,560
perspective. Um the griefing makes

112
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,400
sense. Uh so there is a there is a

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,080
particular player that played EverQuest.

114
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,880
His name is Fancy the Famous Bard. Um he

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,560
was on the good team side

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,320
and um he he griefed evil because evil

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
is bad.

118
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,840
So people who would play evil

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,840
characters, he would run around and

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,840
annoy in a really frustrating way, which

121
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
eventually caused the makers of

122
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,120
EverQuest to change the rules of the

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
server so that bad people could kill

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
him, whereas previously they weren't

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
allowed. They weren't able to.

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,600
>> What did he do?

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
>> Um, so there was this thing there was

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
this mechanic in EverQuest where if you

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,759
were close to a monster, it became

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,479
aggressive and attacked you.

131
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,560
>> Yeah. Um, so he had a lowle character

132
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,360
that was able to run really fast and

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
>> I've heard of him

134
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,759
>> would run around and then run over the

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,199
top of evil people and then the the

136
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
monsters would detach from him and then

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
kill them.

138
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
>> Yeah.

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,759
>> Yeah.

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,400
>> But Oh, yeah. And the the catch was that

141
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,479
um the the server was a no rules server.

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,240
Aside from that is like so you can't

143
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,759
complain to GMs about player

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,960
misbehavior.

145
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,360
Aside from there was a built-in

146
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
protection for players so that if

147
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,759
they're like level four or below, so

148
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
very low level, they can't be killed by

149
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,319
higher level players. Um, and so he just

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,479
sat on the cusp of that yet was still

151
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
able to use his ability to go around and

152
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,680
people who are much higher level. And it

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,479
was it was pretty great. And he did it

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,440
all totally in character as well, which

155
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,440
is what makes it super good.

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,600
Is that me? Okay. Uh I thought of I

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,199
think of portal when they ask you to use

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,199
them as your portal.

159
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
>> You have to burn up the cube.

160
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,400
>> Yeah. You don't want to and they make

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,560
you and you try to like leave without it

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,319
for a few times and you try to break. It

163
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
doesn't work.

164
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,000
>> It's very sad.

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,319
>> I didn't want to do it.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
I thought of uh Jason Roer's Sleep is

167
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
Dead.

168
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
>> Um

169
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
what was that one?

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,360
>> It's more of like a storytelling tool

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,919
where you have one player can control

172
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,599
like the the 2D world and then you have

173
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,120
one player who is the player and they

174
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
can interact with it.

175
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
>> Oh.

176
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,800
>> And each player has like 30 seconds to

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,440
make some kind of action and then you

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,919
make a story going back and forth. And

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,039
um what happens is you can play online

180
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,880
with people and uh like the controller

181
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,639
character will or player will have some

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,160
kind of story that they want to tell and

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
so it's up to the player whether or not

184
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,560
they want to go along with the story and

185
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,280
act like a character in their world or

186
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,479
like try and break the story.

187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,960
>> Okay. What's the name of it again?

188
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,960
>> Sleep is dead.

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,440
>> So actually or brief you say

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,440
>> kind of.

191
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,280
>> Is that the same person as passing?

192
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
>> Yes.

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,840
>> Okay.

194
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,599
>> Um, in Ocarina of Time, there's the

195
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,199
treasure box gambling game. You can

196
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,400
actually cheat if you use the lens of

197
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,319
truth through boxes. So, it's a built-in

198
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,319
mechanic, but that sort of allows you to

199
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,319
cheat.

200
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,680
>> You just got to do that legit.

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
>> Yeah.

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
You can get money easily anyway. It's

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,800
not really good.

204
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,160
>> I do that.

205
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,160
>> I do that completely chip.

206
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000
>> Lucky man.

207
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,440
>> So in the sip hord there's a

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,879
pretty much every sip there's some sort

209
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,080
of slavery mechanic. But I guess in S

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,120
force example I know uh many players

211
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,479
don't seem to mind the fact that we

212
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,080
would all consider that slavery is

213
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,479
ethically wrong. But in in game it's

214
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
actually affectionately called whipping

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
and is considered a very efficient way

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,880
of converting food into

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,880
>> whipping whipping

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
unit.

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
>> Okay. So it's efficient but it's

220
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
slavery. But you combine it, you use

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,519
granaries to offset the population loss.

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,440
And if you spam farms, it becomes a very

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,640
effective way to uh produce, especially

224
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
in hell for your

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,240
>> usually used to exploit a lot of people

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,240
that way.

227
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,040
>> Anyh who,

228
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,959
>> um so in Sims, my friend used to do this

229
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,720
all the time. You just like off your

230
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,920
characters by putting them in a lot of

231
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,920
like the pool and then

232
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,440
>> but you have to watch them flail around

233
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,480
and die

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,480
>> and get tired and

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,880
>> um I have a few I guess a more obscure

236
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,880
example that kind of goes along the

237
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,560
lines of briefing is uh discussions over

238
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,320
the point of the game in communities in

239
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,399
MMOs. Uh specifically, there was

240
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,040
apparently a

241
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,519
huge problem in an obscure mode called

242
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,360
Skys where a large community of the

243
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
players was there to basically

244
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,040
anthropomorphic RP and a large community

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
of the players there was there to play

246
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,800
to win because it had a large combat

247
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,959
economy system. Um, and this effectively

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,680
almost tore the game apart because it

249
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,440
was such a small number of people um

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,440
over what should be the point of this

251
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
game when mechanically so many things

252
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
are bad.

253
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,640
>> Uh, also in Cal Hard you can roll up

254
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:36,360
people

255
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,360
and then a star. It was traumatizing.

256
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,440
>> Yeah, but they're in a giant ball of

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,079
awesome. That's true.

258
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,079
It's not really murder.

259
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,000
[Music]

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,079
>> They don't suffocate on the inside of

261
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,079
the cavary first.

262
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,680
>> It's like a gour. Once you're in there,

263
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,279
you know, it's a better way.

264
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,760
>> You're grateful.

265
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,279
Um, so in fear there's um there's a nail

266
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
gun

267
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,800
and when

268
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,839
>> can't end well

269
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
>> and when you kill people with it, uh,

270
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,720
the game does a really good job of

271
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,120
spectacularly nailing them to surfaces

272
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
in the environment. So if you if like

273
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
someone jumps and then you shoot them in

274
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,680
the shoulder, you'll like you can like

275
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,040
nail them up to the ceiling. And if you

276
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,800
nail them multiple times, you can have

277
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
them like hanging by hand and by their

278
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,519
head and by a foot from the ceiling or

279
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,200
something or from the wall. Anyway,

280
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,600
>> on awesome. Yeah, on forums there were

281
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
entire threads devoted devoted to

282
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,240
sharing

283
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,440
screenshots of your most spectacular

284
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,240
nails like like you know just like the

285
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,120
absolutely most gruesome like you know

286
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,519
five nails to the eye suspending a guy

287
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,519
from a pole kind of thing. And

288
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
um anyway, and there was just a lot of

289
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
debate on these threads cuz most people

290
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
be like, "Yeah, look at this picture.

291
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,760
This one's awesome." And thinking, you

292
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
know, has blood splatters everywhere and

293
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,680
all that, but every like third or fourth

294
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,160
post it be like, "You guys are so messed

295
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,279
up." You know, this is like this is

296
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,200
wrong. And it was and it was it's not

297
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,120
real, you idiot. You know, like but it

298
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,399
but but the fact that you like it is

299
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
still real. Well, then people would

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
argue at, you know, at great lengths

301
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
over this. I just remember chanting upon

302
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,959
these forms and being like, "Is this

303
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,200
messed up?" I'm not sure.

304
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,120
>> So, is it more

305
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,600
efficient in the game to use the nail

306
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
gun to kill people than other

307
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,720
>> It's a hell of a lot more fun.

308
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,120
>> Okay.

309
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,639
>> Um,

310
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
>> but it's not like the game forces you to

311
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,880
do it if you would not want to.

312
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
>> No, it doesn't. You could use other

313
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
guns, but at some point, you know, if

314
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,639
you don't have enough ammo for other

315
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,120
guns, you do you would switch to nail

316
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
gun, I guess. It's a good gun. Shotgun's

317
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
kind of fun, too. It disintegrates

318
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,120
people at short range.

319
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,120
>> Okay.

320
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,000
>> A gun that turns people into skeletons.

321
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,680
>> Yes, that one was in the expansion.

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
>> Yes. No, it wasn't the original. The

323
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,959
sniper rifle was a rail gun that shoots

324
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,240
a beam of electricity and turns people

325
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,240
vaporizes the flesh off other opponents.

326
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,240
What?

327
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,920
>> Um, Grand Theft Auto, you can get a

328
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,160
prostitute for money, get health, and

329
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,000
then potentially kill the prostitute and

330
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,120
get your money back.

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,839
>> The hook or cheat.

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,760
>> Yeah. Um, and then like some of the ones

333
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,519
related to that is like Bioshock where

334
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,760
like you can either kill the little

335
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,760
sisters or and harvest them for like

336
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,480
lots of good or like lots of points

337
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
rather or like save them and get a

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,360
smaller amount of points but like you

339
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
feel better about yourself which

340
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,279
actually in the end ends up being the

341
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,560
better way to go. But

342
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
>> yeah, you get more. It's like you get

343
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
more to save.

344
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
>> Yeah, cuz well cuz like at like you get

345
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,560
small like if you kill them and harvest

346
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,399
them you get like 10 points let's say.

347
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,560
If you save them, you get like five

348
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,800
points, but then after like 10 saves,

349
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
you get like a bonus of like 100 points.

350
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
So, it ends up being like more efficient

351
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,800
or not like more efficient in the long

352
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,560
run to save them. More efficient in the

353
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,760
short run to kill them.

354
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
>> And also, if you're going to kill them,

355
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,839
you should kill them all,

356
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,600
>> right?

357
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
>> Don't just knock off one.

358
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,959
>> Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,800
>> Yeah. Okay. Uh in Age of Empires 3,

360
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,079
there's uh when you're colonizing your

361
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
colony, you have the option of

362
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,519
expediting the native people. So like to

363
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,040
help you uh fight like basically to help

364
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,519
you fight.

365
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,480
>> How do you how is this presented to like

366
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,959
explain?

367
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,519
>> No, I mean you like present them. You

368
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:46,639
establish an outpost inside of their um

369
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,160
residence area and you supposedly trade

370
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
with them, but I mean there's nothing

371
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,639
really there in the game. You just

372
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
literally just put a house of yours

373
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,120
inside of their colony.

374
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
>> Nice.

375
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
>> Also, Microsoft's selling that for 10

376
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,279
cents.

377
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
>> Yeah. inverse.

378
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,160
>> Yeah. Yeah.

379
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,120
>> I think it was just yesterday.

380
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
>> Yeah.

381
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,160
>> I'm not sure.

382
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,440
>> Um I guess infamous you can choose

383
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,959
whether to be bad or good like go around

384
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,399
killing people or to help them survive

385
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,760
postapocalyptic world.

386
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,800
>> And I guess you can kind of do the same

387
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:26,320
thing in Fallout.

388
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:29,120
Well, also, um, Infamous forces you more

389
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,720
to choose. Remember Ash was playing that

390
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,320
in our class and she said like you

391
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,160
really had to go one way or the other to

392
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
get, you know, it's like on either end

393
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,360
of the spectrum there were special

394
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,320
abilities. If you stay in the middle,

395
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,800
you got nothing.

396
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
>> Yeah.

397
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,839
>> Really note

398
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,279
>> follow. I just follow I mean there are

399
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,959
certain things you can build off. So

400
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,000
there's also like in Fallout you can

401
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,759
gain like people that travel with you

402
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,519
like based off neutral

403
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,199
>> oh sorry um I was going to say in

404
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
Fallout as well like in in Fallout 3

405
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,519
there's one particular really good

406
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,199
example um where you get trapped in like

407
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,199
this dream world that this guy is

408
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,360
creating for you and a bunch of other

409
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,519
people um which you don't know that it's

410
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,880
a dream world at first like you know

411
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
it's a dream or something but you don't

412
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,519
know that these are real people in the

413
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,440
dream with you and he tells you to kill

414
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,399
the other people in the dream in order

415
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,040
to like let you get out cuz he's in

416
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,560
complete control of it. Um, and you can

417
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
kill them and you'll get out fine. All

418
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,079
the people will be dead. Um, or there's

419
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,240
ways that aren't like you're not told,

420
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,320
but there's there are ways to like just

421
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,560
go around all of it and just get out

422
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,560
without killing anyone.

423
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,680
>> They stole that from I guess in Balders

424
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,160
2. There's the similar thing. was

425
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,160
actually going to talk.

426
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,480
>> Y

427
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,360
>> So I guess the first thing I'll mention

428
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,919
is uh items but

429
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,439
>> just watching.

430
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,640
>> Yeah, just uh go out of all of them. how

431
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,760
so many times you'll be fighting

432
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
monsters and all of a sudden a bunch of

433
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,400
civilians come by and you can just let

434
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,319
them go, but there's no fun that if you

435
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
kill them, you get life and experience.

436
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,039
So, it's better to reward you for

437
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,039
killing them.

438
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,000
>> Yeah,

439
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,559
>> you get you get some life back. Maybe

440
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,840
some usually do that in the story,

441
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,520
>> huh?

442
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
>> You're Kratos.

443
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
>> Kratos.

444
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,559
>> You are the god of war. Well, you become

445
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,160
the god, but pretty much you just go

446
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,039
around kill hackers and slashing

447
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,760
everything up.

448
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,880
>> Okay. So, you get these are just in

449
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,160
civilians who are doing nothing.

450
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,440
>> Yeah. Who do they're just running

451
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,120
running for their lives from scary

452
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
monsters and then you come and just like

453
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
hack them all into pieces.

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,240
>> Well, also there's in the in the game

455
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,600
you could there's like the second one in

456
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,080
order to pass on you have to translate

457
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,000
something and then translate it you get

458
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,000
a priest. You smash your head to it and

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,520
then they say they have to sacrifice in

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,080
blood. So you just smash them into

461
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,960
pieces until the the blood sacrifice.

462
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
>> Yeah.

463
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
>> This feels so good.

464
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,600
>> Do you happen to do that?

465
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,000
>> Yeah. Oh, okay.

466
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,280
In Indigo Prophecy, uh you switch

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,640
between different sets of characters.

468
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
One of them is a guy who committed a

469
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,720
murder and then you switch to the cops

470
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,640
who are trying to catch him. And so in

471
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,360
one of the earlier scenes you play as

472
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,880
the cops, you bring in a witness and you

473
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,960
um you're trying to make up the artist

474
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
rendering of what the murderer looks

475
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,440
like. And so you can choose whether or

476
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
not to make a faithful rendering and

477
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,520
bring the cops closer to catching him or

478
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,160
to make one that looks not nothing like

479
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,600
him so you can like evade them when you

480
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
play as the other guy.

481
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,160
>> Interesting.

482
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,919
>> If you uh make it not look like you as

483
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
killer

484
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,520
I think he just there are other clues he

485
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,480
has to find in order to finally track

486
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,960
him down.

487
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
>> Can you

488
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,480
win this game?

489
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,480
>> Yeah.

490
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
>> Yeah.

491
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,679
>> I mean, is the goal to catch the killer

492
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,200
for the killer to get away or is

493
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,480
>> it's actually an adventure game. So, the

494
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,480
goal is to get the story.

495
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,840
Hello.

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,400
>> Um, so in the LAR that I played a long

497
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,520
time ago, I was allowed to draw one item

498
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,360
from a location every hour. The game ran

499
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,760
from noon to midnight on three different

500
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,640
days. Um, but I couldn't play before 2

501
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,640
p.m. So, I come in at 2 p.m. How many

502
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,799
items am I was I allowed to draw at the

503
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,720
be when I came in the game? Um, given

504
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,200
that I only missed two hours of game.

505
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,280
And what happens? And if the answer is,

506
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,720
well, I can make that up. And what

507
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,520
happens if I miss an hour halfway

508
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,280
through and if I forget? Um, so yeah, no

509
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,960
one's looking.

510
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
>> Oh, what did you do?

511
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
>> What did I do?

512
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
>> Yes.

513
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
>> What did I do? I think I threw more than

514
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,480
one item at the beginning. Okay.

515
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,360
>> And I made sure I never forgot.

516
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,679
>> So, honor system. A lot of are based on

517
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,679
honor system.

518
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,039
So, in uh Final Fantasy 7, uh like a lot

519
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,799
of Japanese RPGs, you get used to the

520
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,200
idea of walking into people's houses and

521
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,600
just leaving any items you find.

522
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,559
>> Except in FF7, they actually mix it up a

523
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,840
couple times. There are a couple

524
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,039
instances where you go in there and do

525
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
that and the item is fairly

526
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,720
insignificant. Like, you could buy it

527
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,480
easily, like a couple pieces of gold or

528
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,679
gill or whatever it is, and then the

529
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
person walks out of their kitchen or

530
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,039
something. It's like, did did you just

531
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,360
take my item? And you have the option of

532
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,880
saying yes or no. And if you say no,

533
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,960
then you get to keep it. But if you say

534
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,200
yes, they're like, "What the hell? Give

535
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,200
it back."

536
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
>> That was interesting.

537
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
>> Yeah.

538
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
>> I had something that hasn't really been

539
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,039
touched on.

540
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,240
>> Okay.

541
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,880
>> So, when you're running a very large

542
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,600
scale guild in an MMO, you reach a point

543
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,159
where you need to distribute loot from

544
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,760
these high-end rating things. Like the

545
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,280
kind of community optimal thing to do is

546
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,840
for the people who are in charge of the

547
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,679
guild to allocate who gets what so that

548
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,960
you can for instance like kit out the

549
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,919
characters that it's most important for

550
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,559
the guild to have for gear to progress.

551
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,240
But for the most part actual members of

552
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,159
the guild don't really like that because

553
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
you kind of wouldn't like to receive

554
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,960
some kind of reward for having put in

555
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,720
time for the guild and going a long time

556
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,280
without ever having gotten anything is

557
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,120
really frustrating. So people come up

558
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,679
with these intricate systems

559
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
>> DK

560
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,039
>> for DKP.

561
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,520
>> Yeah. For distributing your um resources

562
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,799
essentially to try to balance the

563
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,960
interests of the individual and the

564
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,559
interests of the community.

565
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,440
>> How many of you are unsure what DKP is

566
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,200
driving kill points?

567
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
There are these sometimes elaborate

568
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,760
schemes for if you participate in these

569
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,880
raids, you get so many points. Um, and

570
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,919
the idea is like the guild claims

571
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,240
everything that drops supposedly and uh

572
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,159
you build up points and at some point

573
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
you have enough to buy, you know, a

574
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,520
certain item. So, like let's say you're

575
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,960
on a raid and you just got something

576
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,960
really cool last time and something

577
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,880
drops this time that you could really

578
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
use even though you're there, you don't

579
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,520
necessarily get it because you just

580
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,520
spent all your decrim

581
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,679
primary source of your problem.

582
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,679
>> People play.

583
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,080
>> You learn that by going on raids and

584
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,320
then catch them in practice.

585
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,240
>> And they're a blockout day, too.

586
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,919
>> So, running one of these things is

587
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,280
actually surprisingly complicated and

588
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,919
hard. Um, particularly, so my little

589
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,960
experience, I ran a guild which which

590
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,640
incorporated this. Um, one problem that

591
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,559
happens is that if you have fixed prices

592
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,840
for things, then you kind of get DKP

593
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,280
inflation as prices change and what

594
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,559
happens at whatever you and it's

595
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,919
incredibly complicated to work out and

596
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,840
you got to repric everything constantly.

597
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,000
So instead, we went for a auction based

598
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,720
system where people kind of bid on

599
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,960
things and then prices correct

600
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,120
themselves. However, people can collude

601
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
in auctions in auctions which then

602
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,640
causes a resentment in people who aren't

603
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,960
in on the collusion and the whole thing

604
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,480
is just a nightmare.

605
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,960
And no, I don't run a guild anymore. I'm

606
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,799
really happy.

607
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,360
>> Okay.

608
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,679
>> Um, in games like Pokemon or Animal

609
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,919
Crossing, uh, you can decide whether or

610
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,080
not to change the time on your DS or

611
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
GameCube.

612
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,000
Like when Pokemon Gold and Silver came

613
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,039
out, I was like 10. I had a bedtime. I

614
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,240
didn't have a lot of time to catch all

615
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,400
the nighttime Pokemon.

616
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,360
>> You can do that to manipulate the RNG

617
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,200
and uh, get the stats you want. Perfect.

618
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,240
>> There's also uh times whenever you do

619
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,679
the um random number generator hacks in

620
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,080
games in order to get in order to get a

621
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,480
certain drop that's normally like 1% but

622
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,400
you can increase it up to like almost

623
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,480
100.

624
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,600
But what I was going to say was that

625
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,919
Fallout 3 u so in Fallout 3 you can

626
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,279
pickpocket people and something you do

627
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
when you pickpocket as long as you don't

628
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,400
get caught. You can take a grenade from

629
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,919
your inventory and place it in their

630
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,360
pocket and all of a sudden they be like,

631
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,360
"Oh my god, there's a grenade. Run

632
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,279
away." And it will blow up inside their

633
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,080
pocket and they will blow.

634
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,480
>> What game?

635
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
>> Fall.

636
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,480
>> Fall asleep. It's also And the funny

637
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,200
thing is that's that's actually an

638
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,039
achievement to blow someone up.

639
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
So you get other than the joy and

640
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,080
giggles and

641
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
>> well you can also you get you you they

642
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,840
start from the joy and giggles

643
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
>> you get that you can well yeah you can

644
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,279
pick their pocket so you can whatever

645
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,640
they have in their pocket you can get

646
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,640
>> that is still left.

647
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,919
>> Yeah. Well no I mean you take it out you

648
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,279
take it out as you're putting the

649
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
grenade in.

650
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,799
>> Uh

651
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,320
>> you wouldn't want that boot to be

652
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,200
damaged by the grenade.

653
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,159
>> Put the grenade after

654
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
>> you're just hiding the evidence.

655
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,480
>> Yeah. You're just putting them in at the

656
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,760
same time simultaneously.

657
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,760
And it can be traded

658
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,159
examples we haven't touched on.

659
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,279
>> So I used to play a lot of Ultima online

660
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,960
and they had a bunch of really

661
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,159
sophisticated rules that applied in

662
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,120
certain situations and didn't apply in

663
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,120
situations. So uh there were a lot of

664
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,039
times in the game you just flat out lie

665
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,640
to people and have them go into

666
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,480
situations that were unsafe for them.

667
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,799
For example, if people were in your

668
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,919
house uh In an early version of the

669
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,520
game, if people are inside of your

670
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,679
house, they're automatically flagged as

671
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,960
like attackable by you because they're

672
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,720
because they're in your house and you

673
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,000
might not have let them in. And they can

674
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,760
like run outside their house and they'll

675
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,440
be unattackable by you. But you can also

676
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
like put a trash barrel in front of your

677
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,279
door, which only you can destroy and

678
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,799
nobody else can destroy and they can't

679
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,960
run through that. So you like invite

680
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,480
them in to like trade them something or

681
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,679
join your guild and they're in your

682
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,200
house and then you put a trash barrel

683
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,039
there so they can never leave and you

684
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,919
just kill them

685
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,520
>> or like

686
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
>> or just leave them there, right? or just

687
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,240
leave it. There were there were tons and

688
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,760
tons of ways.

689
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,679
>> Was so cool with this stuff. It's

690
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,240
>> Oh, it's really bad. It's really bad. I

691
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,480
was part of a guild that that did this

692
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,760
to me and then like I told them that I

693
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
had a couple other things. I was like

694
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,760
10. It's pretty sick. A bunch of ways to

695
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,880
like steal tons and tons of money from

696
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,039
people and they didn't realize they

697
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,520
could do it.

698
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,000
>> Yeah.

699
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,080
>> But I feel like just blatantly lying to

700
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,960
people as a as a tactic instead of just

701
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
being mean to them. Okay.

702
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah.

703
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,039
>> Uh the question of uh real world play

704
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,880
for in game items especially in

705
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,159
competitive games

706
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,799
>> um whether or not it's allowed by the

707
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
GMs.

708
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,960
>> Well,

709
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,960
>> I mean those are two different

710
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,640
questions. One is ethical question from

711
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,480
a player standpoint and the other is

712
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
what does it mean in terms of

713
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
>> the player character relation

714
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
>> in the game.

715
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,120
>> Okay.

716
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
>> Oh yeah. I was going to say one thing

717
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,000
that comes up in um especially in board

718
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,279
games they have um a lot of positive

719
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,720
feedbacks called kingmaking and um good

720
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,960
examples are like in Monopoly or

721
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
Settlers or Munchkin and how it works is

722
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,679
like let's say you know you and Owen and

723
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,200
I are playing Settlers and uh typically

724
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,520
what'll happen is say Owen is winning

725
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,960
but I'm typically really far behind or

726
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,679
someone is going to be in a position

727
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,440
where they have no chance of winning. So

728
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,679
hypothetically like he's winning you're

729
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,600
close second and I'm distant third. What

730
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
people do is say, "Hey, Mia, I will give

731
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,360
you everything for your one level card

732
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,600
and then you can win because I'm mad at

733
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,799
all." Right. And that comes up, like you

734
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,399
said, in Monopoly and there's this

735
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,080
question of like, is that a really jerky

736
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,360
thing to do? You know, the rules don't

737
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,440
disallow it.

738
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,080
>> That's kind of an ongoing debate.

739
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,080
>> Yes, it is a jerk.

740
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,799
>> Similarly, Monopoly rules don't

741
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,039
specifically allow like if I have two

742
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,279
orange, we'll like exchange them and

743
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,320
promise each other immunity. properties

744
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,840
or like something that you're not

745
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,080
allowed to actually promise each other

746
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,840
or if you have two reds. I have a red

747
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,000
I'll give it to you and you promise me

748
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,760
half the profits or something like that

749
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,240
where clearly the third person is now

750
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,480
shut out of the game and can't win

751
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,880
because we have an early advantage even

752
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,919
though we're like agreeing to things

753
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,799
that aren't explicitly allowed.

754
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,240
>> Maybe you play Dragon Age.

755
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,279
>> You see

756
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,880
>> I've seen a play.

757
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,919
>> Okay. I've just I'm playing for it right

758
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,600
now. I've been thinking about these

759
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,200
issues a lot. Actually, on my first

760
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,880
playthrough, there's like scene where

761
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,000
there's a kid possessed by a demon. You

762
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,520
have the choice whether to kill him or

763
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,559
not. First time I killed him,

764
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,320
>> I thought everybody did.

765
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,799
>> I had no compulsion about it. Like,

766
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,799
yeah, he's demon.

767
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,080
Turns out everybody really hated that,

768
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,919
you know, all the other characters, my

769
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,240
companions. And this this play time

770
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,600
through, I was like, ah, try it. It's

771
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:18,399
like all this extra work involved. And

772
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:20,960
um but it seems like in the game um

773
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,120
whether you want to do the good thing or

774
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
not, it generally works to your

775
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,480
advantage to do the good thing because

776
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,000
you get like more stuff either better

777
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,880
approval ratings from your companions

778
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,960
who then like unlock bonuses or um you

779
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,679
get stuff. Whereas, you know, being the

780
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,279
jerk

781
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,600
>> kind of depends on who your companions

782
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,559
are.

783
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,279
>> Yeah.

784
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:43,120
>> Does it approves? Um, people like the

785
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,840
the like elven assassin. I can't

786
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,039
remember what his name is.

787
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,919
>> Oh, I'm pretty sure approves as well. He

788
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,039
likes all the jerky things.

789
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,919
>> I didn't have the first play through.

790
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,279
>> Also, um, that one guy, the berserker

791
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,760
guy, um, that you can spot. No, no,

792
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,000
another guy. Um, I think you can get him

793
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,080
on your team at least. He's in the

794
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,799
temple where there's that big dragon and

795
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,760
where you're like doing some ash quest

796
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,840
or something. Um, and like he wants you

797
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,880
to pour dragon blood on the ashes or

798
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,320
something. I'm pretty sure you can get

799
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
them on your team. Am I right or am I

800
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,840
wrong?

801
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,960
>> But I know you can get them as part of

802
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,240
your final army and they're pretty good

803
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,720
>> and they're bad.

804
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,120
>> Okay.

805
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,159
>> Yeah,

806
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,440
>> I just chose poorly my companions like

807
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,679
moralistic ones. I kill a kid.

808
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,600
>> Yeah. Okay.

809
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,279
In the reading that you did, um, Seart

810
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,840
talks about, you know, different

811
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,279
choices, um, and and the way that game

812
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,480
designers are are putting these

813
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,799
together. And he talks about two

814
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
different categories, the open and the

815
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,720
closed ethical systems.

816
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,200
And, um, the open was, you know, more

817
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
letting players kind of determine for

818
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,720
themselves the stance that they want to

819
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,720
take and kind of seeing how that goes

820
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,360
through. whereas the closed is the

821
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,440
system kind of you know forces a

822
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,760
particular way of playing upon you. And

823
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,240
so just kind of going through these

824
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,279
here, where do you see them falling in

825
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,279
terms of closed and open?

826
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,159
>> Um I'm confused what closed means. So

827
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,000
you said open means that you have the

828
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,600
decision like on how to value your

829
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,120
actions and what or what to do. Um both

830
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,960
well like he says for example, you know,

831
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,200
in the Sims with drowning, um he

832
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,520
mentions The Sims as an open game

833
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,799
>> where you can do what you want and uh

834
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,480
kind of think about what happens.

835
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,840
>> I have a definite closed example. It's

836
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
not up there. There might be a closed

837
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,159
example up there. I'm just missing. But

838
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,039
um in the first Modern Warfare game,

839
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,960
they have a flashback uh sequence where

840
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,440
you have to snipe

841
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,480
>> the future bad guy Zakayv. And even

842
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,120
though in the game story he survives

843
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,559
your attempt to kill him, if you don't

844
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,480
actually hit him with the bullet, the

845
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,519
game won't let you progress.

846
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
>> So you have to go and basically snipe

847
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,399
this dude no matter what. The game won't

848
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,919
won't let you do it. And that's just

849
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,480
part of the story. That's how it works.

850
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,320
And it's dubiously moral that you should

851
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,960
be meddling in such affairs. But you

852
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,799
know,

853
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,880
>> and it actually comes back to bite you

854
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,720
later in the game because well, you're

855
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,840
at this you're at the place where it's

856
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,919
causing problems for you. The fact that

857
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,279
you tried to save this guy and then they

858
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,919
play the flashback in which you have to

859
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,600
do it. Um and it's all directed, you

860
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,640
know, you didn't close this.

861
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,480
>> Yeah.

862
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,799
>> Isn't like the Q murder close as well?

863
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,240
Cuz like you don't have a choice like

864
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,720
that you have to kill them to move on.

865
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,320
The what?

866
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,840
>> The cube murder like in uh

867
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
>> Oh, the

868
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
>> Oh, the cube.

869
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
>> Yeah,

870
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,720
>> I'm thinking cube.

871
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,760
>> Yeah. Yeah, that would be close because

872
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,440
you you simply can't move on. You just

873
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,880
have to deal with your

874
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,880
>> joke. Yeah. Yeah. No, exactly.

875
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,080
>> Start vacation is currently closed.

876
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,600
>> Yeah.

877
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:09,519
>> You feel bad about those people. You

878
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,519
just can't play Tamari. I'm sorry. Uh

879
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,559
I have a question actually about um

880
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,039
probably when we asked like the steepest

881
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,320
death briefing. It seems to me that was

882
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,640
intended by design

883
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,000
briefing briefing directly in the cube.

884
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,480
Like the idea that I'm a GM, you're a

885
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,960
player and part of the challenge of the

886
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,960
GM is not knowing whether your player is

887
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,039
going to play along with you, but that's

888
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,200
part of the game. So I don't know if

889
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,200
that's something

890
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,840
That tension is intended.

891
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,760
>> I don't know.

892
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,399
>> Well, I mean,

893
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,960
>> it's still open, right?

894
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,039
>> I would say this one is open, I guess,

895
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,760
>> because you are allowed to do what you

896
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
want.

897
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,720
>> I mean, the example he gives for

898
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,840
closedended is one of them is manhunt,

899
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,679
>> where you have to kill people and you

900
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,600
know, the more grizzly you kill them,

901
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,880
the better. And so like if you don't

902
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,919
like it, you know, there's just no way

903
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,599
to get through the game. And the other

904
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,040
example he also gives is um Shadow of

905
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,040
the Colossus.

906
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,760
>> And that one especially where it's sort

907
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,079
of not really it's ambiguous in terms of

908
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,359
like, okay, I have to kill these things.

909
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,560
And you know, if you play through you

910
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,520
realize like, well, wait a minute,

911
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,520
they're just sort of hanging out.

912
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,520
They're not really doing anything

913
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,760
necessarily bad, but I have to keep

914
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,480
killing them anyhow. Then you can start

915
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,159
to feel sort of guilty, but it's what

916
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,079
you have to do to play the game. So you

917
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,079
would say that's that's a closed system.

918
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,679
So uh let's see I would almost say

919
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,679
Indigo Prophecy might be closed because

920
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,320
you have to go on with the story which

921
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,520
in order you have to make decisions and

922
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,240
such in order to go progress on I feel

923
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,240
like isn't is that right?

924
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,400
>> I think the idea is that close would be

925
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,400
you don't have to make decisions like

926
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
close is like if you want to play the

927
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,680
game you have to make this moral

928
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,800
decision. You don't have a choice in the

929
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,560
moral decision. You have to be evil or

930
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,079
like and that that's that's one thing.

931
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,920
And another game could be you have to be

932
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,760
good. But if you have the decision

933
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
between both paths and that's open, I

934
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,280
believe. Right.

935
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,200
>> The premise behind Indigo Prophecy was

936
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,400
that like you could choose to do any

937
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
action and the game would just have a

938
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
different ending as a result. Though I

939
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,599
think in practice it only had a few

940
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,800
endings, but the premise was sort of

941
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,640
that it would have like countless

942
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,640
endings depending on your actions.

943
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,160
pretty sure that Age of Empires 3 is

944
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,720
going to have some closed

945
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,359
>> um

946
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,599
>> native exploitation because for the

947
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,359
campaigns at least I'm pretty sure there

948
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
are like

949
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,720
>> conditions for completing a scenario

950
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,200
which

951
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,200
is pretty

952
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,520
>> the hooker sheet is open

953
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,079
>> most of the mess are open

954
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,800
>> yeah follow through is definitely

955
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,839
>> the western style one.

956
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,760
>> The fear nail gun is is actually

957
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,680
>> the nail gun is what?

958
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,359
>> I don't know anyone who's gotten through

959
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,040
fear without killing someone with a nail

960
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,119
gun at some point.

961
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,119
>> I mean,

962
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,119
>> I'm wondering actually like you can run

963
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,119
out of ammo and everything else.

964
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,000
>> Yeah. Can you punch things?

965
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,240
>> Yeah, you can. Yeah,

966
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,680
>> you can't run out of ammo. You can

967
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,400
actually kung fu kick things which is

968
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,200
pretty cool.

969
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,480
>> Nice

970
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,480
>> in slow.

971
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,920
>> In fact, I would almost say all the rest

972
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,800
of them seem open.

973
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
>> Pretty open.

974
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,280
>> One of my favorite things.

975
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,440
>> You don't have to do this at any point,

976
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,440
do you?

977
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,160
>> Okay. So, most of these What did we say

978
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,720
about?

979
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
>> Oh,

980
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,920
>> okay.

981
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
So,

982
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,960
>> regarding Bioshock,

983
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,640
>> would that be open or closed?

984
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,320
>> I mean, there's you have a choice, but

985
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,200
it's in your best interest to do one or

986
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,240
the other.

987
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,119
>> Mhm.

988
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,920
>> Well, is it really?

989
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,079
>> So, if you have one only one thing you

990
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,160
can do, it's clearly closed. If you have

991
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,000
only two things you can do that are very

992
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,599
clearly defined, is it really an open

993
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,359
system or is it just a closed system

994
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,040
with two paths?

995
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,359
impressionist arguing was closed.

996
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,880
>> Yeah,

997
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,280
>> because you weren't self-evaluating the

998
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
system was determining whether what you

999
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,880
were doing was good or bad.

1000
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,599
>> I was thinking so like I thought

1001
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,599
infamous like the goods would also be

1002
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,599
closed.

1003
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,599
>> Some of them I think there's a

1004
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,920
difference between only having one

1005
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,720
option the system telling you which

1006
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,720
option is the right option.

1007
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,839
So in that case, some of these turned

1008
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,720
from open to

1009
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,200
>> Bioshock,

1010
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,359
>> like Bioshock would then be closed. Like

1011
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,800
Fallout 3, the Dreamland would then be

1012
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,119
closed.

1013
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,839
>> Like telling you what was the right

1014
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,680
optionally

1015
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,800
acceptable option.

1016
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,119
>> Yeah.

1017
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
>> What do you think? Do you think um he's

1018
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,560
saying I know what you're saying because

1019
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,839
he also mentioned the Old Republic as a

1020
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,320
closed option.

1021
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,960
>> Um

1022
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,440
Is it that there are two discreet like

1023
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,520
like good or evil you know the lights

1024
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:31,280
the Jedi or the nar path? Um is Fallout

1025
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,440
that concrete follow three? I mean like

1026
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,000
I know uh so

1027
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,640
>> Infamous is you know you're either going

1028
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
one way or the other. Um but I'm not as

1029
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,320
sure and I'm just asking people who

1030
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,640
played it. Is Fallout 3 that particular

1031
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,160
in how it's kind of is it setting up a

1032
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,400
dichotomy of like the good character

1033
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,960
versus evil or is it much

1034
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,960
>> it's much more of a gradient

1035
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,760
>> yeah

1036
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
more emphasis

1037
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
>> in Boulders Gate it's weird because

1038
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,599
there's two things there's your

1039
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,839
alignment which you pick at the

1040
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,839
beginning of the game

1041
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:06,000
>> uh D&D style that is just fixed but then

1042
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,359
there's this thing that's your

1043
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,599
reputation which can be decreased if you

1044
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,079
do certain things from the game's point

1045
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,320
of view in view of others. So, you can

1046
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,680
get away with doing bad stuff sometimes

1047
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,320
without actually decreasing your

1048
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,560
reputation. You can also just pick a

1049
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,920
like chaotic evil alignment and then do

1050
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,480
only good things and then it's just very

1051
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,400
weird. Um, so I don't exactly remember

1052
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,760
it how the alignment really factors in

1053
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,440
the game play. But there's a moment, for

1054
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,920
example, in the game there's a big story

1055
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,240
for sort of rejoins that afterwards, but

1056
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,839
you have to, you know, ally yourself

1057
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,960
with either the thieves guild or the

1058
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,200
vampires in a in a town who are sort of

1059
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,400
competing factions. Sort of weird, the

1060
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,599
thieves against the vampire because the

1061
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,280
thieves against the vampires, you got to

1062
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:53,200
pick one uh to help you raid a certain

1063
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,200
area. Um, and you don't really have

1064
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,640
other choices and there's no there's not

1065
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,400
one is not

1066
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,400
>> does it make you gooder or evil? They're

1067
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,160
both kind of bad, but you have to do it

1068
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
to kind of find the person that you're

1069
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,400
trying to get.

1070
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,960
>> That's kind of closed.

1071
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,760
>> Yeah.

1072
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,359
>> So, in terms of Boulders Gate 2, I would

1073
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,240
say one there's like the reputation

1074
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,760
stat, which I found never really into,

1075
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,560
which is some type of metric for your

1076
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
That's not true. If you kill everyone,

1077
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,599
then you have to go and start attacking

1078
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,359
them. Do that.

1079
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,440
>> People in your party can duel you for

1080
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,440
your honor if they get upset at you.

1081
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
Kellorn duled me, left my party, and

1082
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,119
then tried to attack because I was too

1083
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,760
evil.

1084
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,520
>> Anyway, so that's uh like very very

1085
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,119
specific actions that will affect your

1086
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
alignment. And there aren't very many of

1087
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,280
those. In addition, you have kind of

1088
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,119
like these scene type decisions which

1089
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,400
are also very black or white, good or

1090
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,920
equal. I would say there's a lot of

1091
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,240
decisions in the game that don't impact

1092
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,280
both of those to have both an ethical

1093
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,119
choice but not nearly as much of a

1094
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,520
mechanical

1095
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,119
impact.

1096
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,960
>> One of the things he also mentions in

1097
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,400
relation to the open system like going

1098
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,280
back to the Sims is that um

1099
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,760
you can do what you want and the game

1100
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,119
doesn't necessarily punish you. you

1101
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,599
know, like you can murder, you know, you

1102
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,400
you can drown your Sims and the rest of

1103
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,480
the Sims in the house like joy in fear

1104
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,680
or, you know, like disapprove of their

1105
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,599
action.

1106
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,200
>> Um, it's just sort of up to you like

1107
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,319
whether you want to feel bad about it or

1108
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,359
not or or you know, the game has no

1109
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,480
larger response other than uh light the

1110
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,160
Sim die once because I let him set the

1111
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,960
stone on fire and I foolishly mold for

1112
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,560
his life and got his zombie back. Turns

1113
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,760
out the only way zombie is happy in the

1114
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,040
game is if he makes everybody else

1115
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,200
unhappy. So then I had to kill zombie.

1116
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,520
But

1117
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,200
so that was another kind of element to

1118
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,720
it. One of the things that he talks

1119
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,400
about in general in relation to all of

1120
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,599
this and a lot of these kind of fit is

1121
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,240
like ethics through statistics. You like

1122
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,319
that somehow ethical systems are on this

1123
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,680
point or sliding scale and that you know

1124
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,359
you're heading towards good or you're

1125
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,720
heading towards evil. We were even

1126
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,560
mentioning this before class started

1127
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,800
that, you know, you can blow up an

1128
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,800
entire town, but then if you know, like

1129
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,160
you give like three beggars 50 cents

1130
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,400
each, suddenly, you know, you're back at

1131
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,040
neutral because of the way that these

1132
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,319
lighting systems work, you know, in

1133
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,440
bizarrely mechanical.

1134
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,640
>> Yeah, you you can buy reputation back by

1135
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,640
donating to temples.

1136
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,000
>> It's like indulgences.

1137
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,280
>> Yeah, it is exactly like

1138
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,640
>> I want that not going to happen.

1139
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
I have to close this now because I'm

1140
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,520
getting high off of the microphones. I

1141
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,800
wanted to show you an example um of one

1142
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,280
that we haven't talked about yet.

1143
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,880
Somebody mentioned Call of Duty. This is

1144
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,119
actually from last year. It's not

1145
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,640
Castro, which is the new one. Um but

1146
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,000
>> is it the Russian hostage thing?

1147
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,000
>> Yeah, it's the no Russian level

1148
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,000
>> from Modern Warfare 2.

1149
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,560
>> It's like a competition.

1150
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,040
This is um so this was last year's

1151
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,040
modern uh Call of Duty and this was the

1152
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,280
optional level. You did not have to play

1153
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,160
it and of course it caused a big storm

1154
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,599
when it was released. Um I'm just going

1155
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,359
to play it and then we can talk about it

1156
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,000
after.

1157
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,400
>> So what's has anyone played this?

1158
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,960
>> Yeah.

1159
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,040
>> Want to um provide a little context or

1160
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:32,400
explain the a little bit more?

1161
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,440
So the convoluted plot is that this is a

1162
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,599
false flag attack which is staged by a

1163
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,720
terrorist organization which is meant to

1164
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,640
frame the CIA to start a war between

1165
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,480
Russia and the US. And so the idea here

1166
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,359
is that you are playing a character who

1167
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,760
is undercover as part of the CIA who was

1168
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,560
part of this terrorist organization.

1169
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,880
And then you end up being double crossed

1170
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,319
because they as it was just revealed at

1171
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,680
the end they knew that you were a CIA

1172
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,280
agent and they're trying to pin the

1173
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,040
attack on America.

1174
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,960
>> So that's that's you have the option

1175
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,000
>> story context. the option of shooting

1176
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,760
Makarov in the back or

1177
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,560
>> if you try and shoot Makarov then the

1178
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,160
game then the level ends with a fail

1179
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,839
>> um and can't progress in the game. If

1180
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,160
you try and get through the level

1181
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,640
without shooting any civilians the level

1182
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,440
also ends off discover decides that

1183
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,200
you're a traitor and shoots you

1184
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,560
before doing anything else

1185
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,599
>> before he's supposed to shoot you

1186
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,960
>> before he's supposed to shoot you. I

1187
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,160
seem to remember.

1188
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,839
>> I I think you can get through the

1189
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,359
mission by not shooting any civilians,

1190
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,880
but you can't get through without

1191
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,680
shooting any of the cops.

1192
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,200
>> Yeah. Like something

1193
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,880
>> if you don't shoot the cops, I think you

1194
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,440
can.

1195
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,920
>> Yeah. You still have to shoot civilians.

1196
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,359
>> Yeah.

1197
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,599
>> Maybe different difficulty settings as

1198
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,119
well.

1199
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,200
>> Yeah. I don't know. Also, that guy was

1200
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,800
incredibly diligent about killing

1201
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,960
civilians.

1202
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,280
>> I mean, I I was I was impressed. I did

1203
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,280
not play that level that way. Oh, I

1204
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
think

1205
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,920
that's

1206
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,440
>> Yeah, that was uh that guy took his work

1207
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,440
to heart. Like

1208
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,839
>> I don't think that I would have like

1209
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,560
like Owen says if I was I haven't played

1210
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,800
Modern Warfare 2 yet, but or Black Ops

1211
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,640
for that matter, but don't feel like it

1212
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,560
would it would come to me that it was

1213
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,160
really necessary to just hunt down every

1214
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,720
last

1215
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,119
>> thorough. It was very thorough.

1216
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,680
>> Yeah, blend in. And but you know it's

1217
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,200
also interesting that you're the dupe in

1218
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,480
this, right? You think, well, I'm

1219
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,000
killing all of these people

1220
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,160
>> so that I can then kill him probably or

1221
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,839
something,

1222
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,119
>> right? Or it's for a greater good,

1223
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,960
right? That you know, I'm going to get

1224
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,079
in with this group and and help bring

1225
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,000
down this terrorist cell or haha, you

1226
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,960
know, not so much.

1227
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,839
>> And I mean, Call of Duty like has anyone

1228
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,480
played Black Ops?

1229
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,920
There's the scene in it, another uh

1230
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,880
level where you can assassinate Castro

1231
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,319
>> and um I was just watching it off Castro

1232
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,640
>> this morning and uh

1233
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,839
>> is it they they

1234
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,040
Russian uh Cuba objected

1235
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,440
>> um to to the video game.

1236
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,760
But um I watched that level. It's not

1237
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,520
nearly as exciting as this one. Um

1238
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,160
although it's interesting in that you uh

1239
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,839
he's you infiltrate his compound, you

1240
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,079
know, you get up to he's like in his

1241
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:27,040
bedroom with his or whatever she is and

1242
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,040
um you shoot him and in this uh clip the

1243
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,000
guy shot him in the head and it's it

1244
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,000
slows down to bullet time actually and

1245
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,800
you see it enter his forehead and he

1246
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,599
falls over and and then the enraged

1247
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,440
lover grabs the machine gun and starts

1248
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,920
firing at you in her negligence so you

1249
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,440
have to kill her too. And yeah, Cuba is

1250
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,359
outraged,

1251
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,920
but I I don't think it takes a lot to

1252
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,680
get Cuba mad anyway.

1253
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,000
>> Can you score statistics?

1254
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,839
>> Don't like statistics.

1255
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,040
>> 495 likes, 85 dislikes.

1256
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:05,280
>> It's pretty high for dislikes.

1257
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:07,200
>> For something that's not like video,

1258
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,560
>> um

1259
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,160
I I No. Yes. I I in the previous Modern

1260
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,920
Warfare game, there's actually It

1261
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,240
it it I haven't seen anyone draw this

1262
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,319
parallel, but there is a level where you

1263
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,800
are in the middle of a firefight, a US

1264
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:28,880
marine in some Middle Eastern wars,

1265
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,680
and you're told to shoot at enemies who

1266
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,319
are coming on the on your center, but

1267
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,760
they're at such a range that you cannot

1268
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,280
tell friend. there's you're absolutely

1269
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,440
certain that whatever you're shooting

1270
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,920
at, there's a 50% chance that there's

1271
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,160
actually some one one of the allies.

1272
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,680
>> There there's also the really creepy um

1273
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,920
>> that's the gunship sequence. the gunship

1274
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,280
>> which is which is which is uh which gets

1275
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,960
most of the attention but I I I but but

1276
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,599
the I was surprised by the subtlety of

1277
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,160
the the the sequence where you are just

1278
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,400
in the middle of a firefight in in

1279
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,800
Modern Warfare one because it has that

1280
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,000
situation of the you are being told to

1281
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,280
kill but you

1282
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,560
may not even though everyone on on um

1283
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,319
that you might be shooting at is a

1284
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,119
combatant you may not want to shoot

1285
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,560
everyone. in this space, you know, maybe

1286
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,319
I felt that actually made a more

1287
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,400
interesting subtle point of well,

1288
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,319
actually that's kind of what the

1289
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,839
situation of being in the Middle East

1290
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,720
right now is like it's hard to tell

1291
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,040
where

1292
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,680
>> Yeah.

1293
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,640
Um, I was thinking about this because I

1294
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,760
actually um I did an interview last week

1295
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,599
or two weeks ago with some radio people

1296
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,880
and it was about Black Ops being

1297
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,839
released because it's like the best

1298
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,280
selling entertainment video ever and uh

1299
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,800
they introduced it of course on the

1300
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,000
segment as the ultraviolent video game

1301
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,480
>> Call of Duty.

1302
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,160
>> H

1303
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,839
>> that's pretty accurate. It is, but it's

1304
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,000
and one of the thing, one of the

1305
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,280
questions that they asked that each

1306
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,040
affiliate asked over and over is, you

1307
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,040
know, they mentioned the caster level.

1308
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,599
They said the video games gone too far.

1309
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,720
You know, is there is there a line that

1310
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,720
that shouldn't be crossed? And I'm sure

1311
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,480
if they had I mean, none of these people

1312
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,680
actually played video games, so you

1313
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,440
know, they had they were just reading

1314
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,760
their script.

1315
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,720
This might have even fit even better,

1316
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,599
you know, in terms of how

1317
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,599
>> this is pretty I'm surprised this got

1318
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,280
through.

1319
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,839
>> Well, it's an optional level,

1320
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,920
>> right?

1321
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,839
>> You know, you don't have to do it.

1322
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,040
Interesting comment right there. You

1323
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,680
know, JFK airport US citizens.

1324
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,920
>> But, you know, leaving aside the just

1325
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,440
like the the knee-jerk kind of gamer

1326
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,760
defense, well, it's just for fun or it's

1327
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,240
just a video game. I mean, how do you

1328
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,000
answer that question? I mean, I know

1329
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,839
what I spew to them, but I'm just

1330
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,160
curious in terms of like what is what

1331
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,559
does it mean and beyond just like games

1332
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:01,040
as like statistics for like the good or

1333
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,720
the dark side? Um, you know, is there a

1334
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,200
point you think where it can go too far

1335
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,559
with the game? What um what's the

1336
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,720
assumption behind that question?

1337
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,200
this really

1338
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,160
disturbing news report I was reading

1339
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,040
about this Japanese game called Wave

1340
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,240
Play.

1341
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,400
>> Oh yeah.

1342
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,160
>> And the disturbing for me it was clear

1343
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,960
like this is totally messed up. Can't

1344
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,599
believe that this is like this exists.

1345
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,680
But the part that was disturbing was the

1346
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:34,319
the defense put forth by the developers

1347
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,319
and they were say who are you guys to be

1348
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,760
telling us this is messed up. You

1349
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,400
Americans, you make games all the time

1350
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,920
where you have to kill people. Murder is

1351
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,960
a much worse crime than rape. Our game

1352
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,839
is not nearly as bad as for say this.

1353
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,359
And I was just like, wait, no, but but

1354
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,359
that's more messed up. But but what and

1355
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,960
and I don't know what what to think of

1356
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,599
it. Um South Park.

1357
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,359
>> What?

1358
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,319
>> South Park episode that addresses South

1359
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,200
Park.

1360
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:07,520
>> Not seen that South Park

1361
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,720
actually. Um just on that on that game

1362
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,599
in particular, there was a lot of

1363
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,760
backlash I heard in Japan about um

1364
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,079
Replay. Mainly because the game had been

1365
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,680
out for maybe 2 years and gone

1366
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,520
completely unnoticed until basically the

1367
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,720
West heard about it, America and Europe,

1368
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,880
because I think it showed up on like

1369
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,480
Amazon.com or something at some point.

1370
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,559
And of course there was a gigantic

1371
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,800
controversy and the media blew it up

1372
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,480
completely. And so then in Japan I think

1373
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
I think it was it banned in Japan I

1374
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,160
think.

1375
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,720
>> No.

1376
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,480
>> So something like Japanese politicians

1377
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,960
out for a while like negative attention

1378
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,559
all the time.

1379
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,480
>> Apparently like Japanese politicians

1380
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,240
started cracking down on these types of

1381
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,599
games and a lot of fans got like really

1382
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,240
angry and they said well this is just

1383
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,000
like your western eur eurosentric view.

1384
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,480
It's like and why is this backlashing

1385
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,440
onto us kind of thing. The only reason

1386
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,440
why there was a backlash was because of

1387
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,200
political attention, not necessarily

1388
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,520
because of moral.

1389
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,359
>> Well, I mean, a lot of our moral

1390
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,960
framework is sort of Judeo-Christian in

1391
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,200
nature.

1392
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,200
And I was I read an entire entire

1393
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:13,440
Wikipedia article on such things

1394
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,880
afterwards. Uh, child pornography

1395
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,880
as as long as it doesn't actually use

1396
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,400
child actors. So like representations,

1397
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,440
animated, 3D, whatever, is not illegal

1398
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,440
in Japan. U and and there's no real

1399
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,040
political pressure either to make it

1400
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,920
illegal. It's just not part of the

1401
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,200
public consciousness that's something

1402
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,160
that needs to be made illegal. Um

1403
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,400
and and the point is not a a weird point

1404
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,319
like completely crazy that that you know

1405
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,280
killing people is probably the worst

1406
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:45,800
crime and and you know and the West

1407
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,800
makes games advocate that all the time.

1408
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,240
>> So the question

1409
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,079
Well, in the radio interview with that

1410
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,480
answer

1411
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,960
question in terms of like the question

1412
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,640
of uh whether or not a game crosses a

1413
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,160
line first assumes that there is a line

1414
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,240
to be crossed and

1415
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,000
>> I guess second I guess my answer would

1416
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,839
be yes there is a line but that line is

1417
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
basically whether or not people buy the

1418
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,720
game. If people buy the game, the game

1419
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,319
hasn't really crossed the line.

1420
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,960
>> So, see this image reminds me of like

1421
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:20,640
the video reminds me of remember the

1422
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,160
game of 9/11 where you are a person on

1423
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,359
one of the top floors.

1424
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,800
>> Oh, you can jump.

1425
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:26,480
>> Yeah. Well, that's the only way to end

1426
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,200
the game. You can go anywhere you want,

1427
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,040
but there's no escape. And so, the only

1428
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,680
way to end the game is to jump out of

1429
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,599
window.

1430
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,440
>> And that that had the same response. I

1431
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,720
think

1432
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,240
>> I was just going to say back on the

1433
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,720
point of like is there a line or not? I

1434
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,559
think the line is not a line on whether

1435
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,760
like it becomes okay or not. It's a line

1436
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,880
between I know we've mentioned this

1437
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,960
before, but like between like

1438
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,079
pornography and art. Like like there's a

1439
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,680
line like if you're you know there's

1440
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,440
there's ways to like take pictures of

1441
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,119
like naked human bodies and like it's

1442
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,359
artful like people respect it and all

1443
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,680
that. And like there's there's ways in

1444
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:03,599
games to represent killing and rape and

1445
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,839
all that kind of stuff in a way that

1446
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,680
provides a message within this framework

1447
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,440
that makes it okay. And there were

1448
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,800
there's like there's games where like

1449
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,160
you know I think Manhunt was one of

1450
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,400
these where it's like there's no real

1451
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,119
like point other than just like

1452
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,640
displaying just terrible terrible images

1453
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,400
for the sake of displaying them. And

1454
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,839
like in my mind it's very very similar

1455
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,800
to like the discussion of like is that

1456
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,640
image like pornography art and so I

1457
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,319
think that's that's the right way to go

1458
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,800
with this kind of thing in particular.

1459
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,280
Like I feel that there's this question

1460
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,559
of like is it doing anything meaningful

1461
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,119
in the game other than just being

1462
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,359
virtuous and in this case it's

1463
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,960
definitely yes like it progresses the

1464
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:47,520
plot um kind of

1465
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,119
makes you think I guess a bit about the

1466
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,559
characters that are involved like

1467
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,920
there's there's actual there's character

1468
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,800
development of Marov of Marov here. Um

1469
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,119
it's showing the shady dealings of the

1470
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,559
CIA and all this kind of business. So

1471
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,520
like it's also making a political

1472
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:06,000
statement at the same time. Um so yeah,

1473
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,319
I mean it's it's not just nailing

1474
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,680
people's eyes to the ceiling or what

1475
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,920
have you.

1476
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,119
>> I definitely feel like there I I was

1477
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,559
thinking like are there any games that

1478
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,640
are over the line? I definitely imagine

1479
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,440
a game would be over the line. Like you

1480
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,119
could imagine if like in Rafe or

1481
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,440
whatever it's called there were like a

1482
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,119
customizable character thing advertised

1483
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,720
like rape your neighbors or something

1484
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,200
like that. I would be uncomfortable with

1485
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,200
something like that.

1486
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,200
So I feel like I I almost wanted to say

1487
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,559
that there is no line to make people buy

1488
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,200
it, but I feel like there are some

1489
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,200
things where like they would be over the

1490
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,160
line regardless of whether people buy

1491
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,599
them.

1492
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,640
>> People might even buy them because they

1493
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,920
are over this line.

1494
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,599
>> Oh yeah, of course. That's why you would

1495
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,280
buy that.

1496
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:51,520
>> What about how many of you have uh

1497
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,599
played or seen Super Combine Master RPG?

1498
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,599
How many of you have heard of it?

1499
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,240
>> Okay. I mean, does that game cross a

1500
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,760
line?

1501
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,680
Can somebody describe this?

1502
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,680
>> I mean, I get an idea from the title.

1503
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:13,760
>> Attent it's it's kind of a Super

1504
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:16,240
Nintendo era styled RPG. It's it it has

1505
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,359
you walking around in a sort of Final

1506
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:23,520
Fantasy Nintendo

1507
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:27,200
era kind of graphics with quotes and

1508
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,720
dialogue that have been

1509
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,760
um that have been collected from the

1510
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:37,280
actual news reports uh or and you know

1511
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:39,200
the the deliverables um uh diaries and

1512
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,680
stuff like that

1513
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:47,599
and uh and yeah it it it it is largely

1514
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,480
about the events leading up to and the

1515
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,480
massacre itself and yes you do go around

1516
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,280
and I I can't remember whether you

1517
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,240
actually

1518
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,400
>> you do everything

1519
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,160
>> yeah you you shoot

1520
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,240
You have to plant you you have to sneak

1521
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,799
into the school. I forget which one you

1522
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,280
start off as either, you know, gold or

1523
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,280
Harris, but you you pick up your friend.

1524
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
It's very RPG-ish in the beginning where

1525
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,559
you're in your room because you touch

1526
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,319
objects and it gives flashbacks to like

1527
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,319
your friendship with this guy like

1528
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,799
learning how to make pipe bombs behind

1529
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,000
the convenience store and you pick them

1530
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,960
up, you go to the school, you have to

1531
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,559
sneak in and plant some bombs and after

1532
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,280
those go off and you move through the

1533
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,960
school and you're shooting and um it's

1534
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,720
interesting. Brian fire this five times

1535
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,480
now, but I showed it to a class once uh

1536
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,720
in Ohio, my old school, and

1537
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,960
we're I'm like sneaking into the school,

1538
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,359
right? And there are security cameras

1539
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,359
you have to avoid and uh students who

1540
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,960
can't be seen by them either. And

1541
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,040
there's a point where, you know, I'm

1542
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,799
trying to manipulate the character and

1543
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,240
and everyone class like, "Oh, that way,

1544
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,680
that way, that way. Oh, oh, you know,

1545
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,599
you blew it. You got seen. You got

1546
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,760
kicked out. You get it." And it was like

1547
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,040
this moment of like typical gaming. Ah,

1548
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,640
I did it. And then you realize like I

1549
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,079
got kicked out of the school because I

1550
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,000
was trying to plant a bomb. This was

1551
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,079
based on something that really happened.

1552
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,680
And it was that moment of like you were

1553
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,760
saying with the friendly fire and not,

1554
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,839
you know, not sure who you're shooting.

1555
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,160
And it was like, wow.

1556
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,280
>> You know, this is something that made me

1557
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,960
think about what about all those other

1558
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,920
games where I'm happy to kill people and

1559
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,440
I don't really think about the

1560
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,599
consequences. And this is a game where

1561
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,319
you were forced to. say I think there's

1562
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,599
a really interesting parallel in a film

1563
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,359
um that I can think of with the battle

1564
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:31,040
of Alers. I don't know if you've seen

1565
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:36,000
this, but so there's this scene where

1566
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,760
you're following um the insurgents who

1567
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,960
are these two women who've managed to

1568
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,200
smuggle bombs into a cafe which is

1569
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,040
basically just a a civilian hangout

1570
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:50,880
which is largely um frequented by the

1571
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:54,000
the ruling French um section of society

1572
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,559
there. And there's this incredibly tense

1573
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,319
scene where they're trying to like leave

1574
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,720
their bombs

1575
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,839
in the cafe without being detected and

1576
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,520
get out of there. And you're like, "Oh

1577
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,960
my god,

1578
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,559
are they going to be able to make it? I

1579
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,920
hope that they can bomb this cafe." And

1580
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,280
you're like,

1581
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,280
>> "What are they thinking? This is

1582
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,200
terrible."

1583
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,960
And it definitely you definitely have

1584
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,520
that same kind of tension though. Yeah.

1585
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,960
I feel like people spend devote too much

1586
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,440
emotional energy into getting offended.

1587
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,319
Um people really pour their heart and

1588
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:32,559
souls into getting offended by things.

1589
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:36,480
Um and the the line for me is is it does

1590
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:38,400
it advocate and is it instructional?

1591
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,280
If it's not either of those two things,

1592
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,440
it doesn't affect me really. And if you

1593
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,280
really want to go out and play some

1594
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,799
messed up it's not my none of my

1595
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,119
business.

1596
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,079
and my line is not going to be the same

1597
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,000
as your line. It's not going to be the

1598
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,400
same as someone else's line. And because

1599
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
there is no easily definable line, it

1600
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,960
really scares me that someone could

1601
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,960
define a line. And since since I don't

1602
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,440
like that idea, I'd rather say that as

1603
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,440
long as it's not advoc,

1604
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,839
you know, my attitudes are so liberal

1605
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,280
and someone else's attitudes might be so

1606
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,319
conservative and oh god, someone else's

1607
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,839
attitudes might be even more liberal

1608
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,040
than mine. and be okay with things that

1609
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,559
I wouldn't feel comfortable with. If I

1610
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,079
was allowed to draw a line, someone else

1611
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,520
could draw it somewhere, you know,

1612
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,240
either before or after, and that would

1613
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,359
just mess everything up. And and so, you

1614
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,880
know, that that that's how I kind of

1615
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,200
feel about it. And I think that the

1616
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,640
environment right now kind of is tends

1617
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,119
towards that. Um, in that

1618
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,440
>> what

1619
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,720
>> the the line drawing the

1620
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,599
>> tends towards line drawing.

1621
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,440
>> Yeah. People in general are not people

1622
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,040
who make games are not intrinsically on

1623
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,960
average really messed up and so tend to

1624
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,119
make stuff that they feel generally

1625
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,680
comfortable with. Uh and those who are

1626
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:03,200
messed up, you know, I mean you just

1627
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,480
draw attention to them really by giving

1628
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:09,760
them publicity anyway. But but uh for

1629
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,000
every person who says that that you know

1630
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,599
what what game like Diablo II got an M

1631
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,880
rating because of violence. Now if you

1632
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,319
look at it today, it's like little

1633
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,240
sprites whacking at each other, you

1634
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,640
know, but that was the line back then.

1635
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,559
and and if that's the line today then

1636
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,079
that this stuff is is just absolutely

1637
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,839
horrendous and should not be

1638
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,359
disseminated. I think it should be and

1639
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,839
someone else might think that what I

1640
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:31,599
think is okay is not okay and it's just

1641
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,400
going to be what I think is not okay is

1642
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,760
okay and

1643
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,000
it's very complicated.

1644
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,480
>> Just got to get death threats.

1645
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,440
>> Yeah.

1646
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,520
>> For releasing this game. I I strongly

1647
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,160
like to

1648
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:49,040
uh to to agree with the a lot of effort

1649
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,000
being put into the line drawing u and

1650
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:54,720
especially public discussion

1651
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,480
uh the the the public display of hand

1652
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,280
drawing the line here mostly by

1653
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,359
politicians but people with with some

1654
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,559
sort of u

1655
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,520
>> possibly self often self-interested

1656
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,720
agenda you know it's like for um both

1657
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,760
and both by the game industry and

1658
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,359
It seems it seems like there's more

1659
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,880
effort

1660
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:23,599
either being used to figure out what is

1661
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,559
offensive and what is not offensive than

1662
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:29,359
to possibly

1663
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,760
uh to discuss the the the need that some

1664
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,440
things can should be able to offend.

1665
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,680
Then we should have stuff that allow

1666
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,119
that that that needs to exist. Well,

1667
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,599
then because it's so hard to actually

1668
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,599
figure out where the line is. It's like

1669
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,319
then then there needs to be some stuff

1670
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,040
that crosses because maybe the line you

1671
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,559
can't draw.

1672
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,760
>> Yeah. And it's a method to desensitize

1673
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,680
adults to violence. There's so much

1674
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,559
violence these days. Be better if you

1675
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,079
didn't freak out at every level.

1676
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,599
>> I think it's totally okay to be freaked

1677
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,359
out at things. I think that you should

1678
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,599
definitely say when you're offended by

1679
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:03,119
something and I think that should be

1680
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:07,119
open to debate like whether something is

1681
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,760
like a decent artistic expression or

1682
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,520
>> but I mean

1683
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,520
>> I mean like so there's there's a

1684
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,119
difference between

1685
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,280
stating that you find something

1686
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,200
offensive and attempting to have these

1687
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,680
things banned or right so

1688
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,079
>> I agree and I'm totally fine with people

1689
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,520
wasting words on on saying whether it's

1690
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,359
like

1691
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,720
>> no clearly But as long as because you

1692
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,400
are offended, you think I shouldn't be

1693
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,359
able to look at it. That's that's the

1694
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,720
problem.

1695
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,599
>> Okay.

1696
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,920
>> Or even or even better, if by by being

1697
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,480
offended, you get to now make your

1698
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,720
point. You know, it's like, you know,

1699
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,200
this is this is why this offends me and

1700
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,960
this is these are my reasons for it

1701
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,839
might be more informative and actually

1702
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,680
better for society to get that those

1703
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,079
ideas in the open.

1704
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,680
>> People also get offended by proxy. This

1705
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,079
doesn't offend me, but I can see how it

1706
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,920
would affect other

1707
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,640
>> well and people are I think there's also

1708
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,119
a conflation of of taking offense and

1709
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:06,400
discomfort. Um because you know playing

1710
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,760
these games might be uncomfortable. Um

1711
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,880
and I don't think that's necessarily a

1712
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,200
bad thing, you know, if makes you think

1713
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,319
about like what Ellen is saying or like

1714
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,520
this game combat massacre if it makes

1715
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,119
you think about things in a different

1716
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,799
way or like that film. I mean, and

1717
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,400
especially games have the ability to

1718
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:23,839
kind of provoke that in you to make you

1719
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,280
think because you're the one, especially

1720
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,520
these games that force you to do certain

1721
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,960
things. It's like, well, and I mean,

1722
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,799
think about is there a game that you

1723
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,799
absolutely refuse to play because, you

1724
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:35,760
know, there was something in it that you

1725
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:39,599
just really did not want to do.

1726
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,319
>> So, that's fine. Yeah, I think we'll end

1727
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,319
there.
