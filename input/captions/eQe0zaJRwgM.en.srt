1
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,439
so where do we

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,800
stand we gone

3
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:24,199
uh long

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,320
way not yet uh done heat but we've done

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:30,599
temperature and we introduced this

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,840
diagram energy versus entropy

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,760
that allows us to um represent most of

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,399
the results that we have uh uh discussed

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,520
so

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,480
far so I want

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,640
to do a little more with this um

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,120
diagram notice that um it took us a

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,879
while to get to temperature because in

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,199
order to Define temperature we

15
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,760
need uh the state principle the

16
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,000
fundamental relation for the sa

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,600
equilibrium States because it's only for

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,240
those states that we can Define the

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,720
slope of this curve which is the

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,960
temperature in other words states that

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,520
are inside the region these are

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,439
nonstable in general non equilibrium

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,880
states there is no temperature defined

24
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:30,920
there although we will see as we go on

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,680
that uh we may be able

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,600
to uh represent the system as a

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,040
composite of several uh smaller systems

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,720
for that are close to equilibrium so

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,280
that somehow we can assign temperatures

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,680
that's what we do in fluid mechanics

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,399
that's an interesting application of

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,399
what we

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:57,159
doing okay we have seen that with this

34
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,680
diagram we can if I have a generic State

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,640
here and I want to uh presentent what I

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,560
can do the best I can do in a weight

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:12,560
process best in in the sense of trying

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,879
to extract as much energy as possible uh

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,640
from our system in such a way that we

40
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,080
make uh um something useful uh like

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,599
lifting a weight okay the maximum we can

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
do we can do in a weight process is the

43
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:31,200
adiabatic availability of that state

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,239
which is represented here

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,640
by the difference in energy on the

46
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,640
vertical

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,599
line uh and in fact the the final State

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,720
when we reach when we do this maximum we

49
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,080
have done the process reversibly

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,720
otherwise you get

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,319
less and in a weight in a reversible

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,159
weight process the entropy remains

53
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,440
constant we've seen as one of the uh

54
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,959
theorems that we cited and

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,680
so the process that it extracts the

56
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,680
weight process that extracts diabetic

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,840
availability moves vertically down until

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,879
you reach the um lowest uh energy state

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,959
with that entropy you cannot go below so

60
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:20,680
you cannot exract more en more energy

61
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,680
because there are no stat below that

62
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,400
one

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,000
we uh discussed the fact that the

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,000
thermal Reservoir as constant

65
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:41,720
temperature and um you actually have in

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,480
the homework um this uh discussion to

67
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,159
try to reproduce it the definition of

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,439
temperature for a reservoir so for the

69
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,360
reservoir the stable equum State curve

70
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:55,120
is just a straight uh line the allowed

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,480
states are onthel these are also

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,920
reservoirs can have non equilibrium

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,599
States but most of the times we are

74
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,319
interested in their equilibrium stable

75
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,280
equilibrium

76
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:13,799
ons and then we also constructed the

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,000
available energy and I want to so do the

78
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,359
somehow do this again on the Blackboard

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,160
just so that we can uh um see together

80
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,000
this uh uh

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,039
construction I'm going to do it uh in a

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,840
slightly different way so that uh

83
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,840
so that uh we can

84
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:41,360
uh so say that this is our system a and

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,400
this

86
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,400
is It's e sucess

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,720
diagram and this time let's

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,080
do you see in in the view

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:01,960
graph State A1 is to the left of the

90
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,880
final Mutual equilib state to reservoir

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,680
uh which is a so I'm going to do it uh

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,080
just for a change

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,400
differently so I assume now that the

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,400
state is here

95
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,080
A1 and that

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,360
the final State when I will uh reach

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,160
Mutual equilibrium with the reservoir

98
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,160
it's going to be

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,479
here that means

100
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,400
that the

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,199
temperature of the

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,600
reservoir is this

103
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,960
one because when they're in mutual

104
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,199
equilibrium the system and the reservoir

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,160
have the same temperature we haven't

106
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:53,160
proved that yet but uh we we do it uh

107
00:05:49,160 --> 00:06:00,479
hopefully today just after this example

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:04,280
uh so let me draw below here also

109
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,280
the E versus S diagram for the

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,599
reservoir

111
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,240
look so you see that in order to go from

112
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,240
here from this state to this

113
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,759
state the system must decrease its uh uh

114
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,759
its ENT

115
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,199
okay definitely it cannot do it in a

116
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
weight process because in a in a weight

117
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,440
process the most you can do is keep the

118
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
entropy constant but if you're not doing

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,240
things reversibly you generate entropy

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,360
so you going to move to the right not to

121
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,360
the left so in order to do

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,120
that this is the reason

123
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,880
why wanted

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,800
to we

125
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,120
can use the reservoir because we're

126
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,879
considering you're studying the

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,919
uh a diabatic availability available

128
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,240
energy is the diabatic availability of a

129
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:07,039
composite system in which there is a

130
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:11,680
reservoir so my initial state is here I

131
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:16,720
have a reservar and what I want to do is

132
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
lift the weight as much as

133
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,800
possible so the reservoir is

134
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,120
available to do this

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:35,120
job we need to to remove entropy from uh

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,319
the

137
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:44,720
system so we can transfer that

138
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,720
entropy from system a to the

139
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,240
reservoir

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,120
okay so the system must

141
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,680
decrease its uh

142
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,080
entropy from

143
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,080
S1 to

144
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:16,960
Sr the reservoir can take

145
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:19,639
it so okay so the reservoir as a as a

146
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,000
stable equilibrium state with this slope

147
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,000
so it's

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,080
this

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,719
um it must take and y so its entropy

150
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,039
will

151
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,000
increase so the initial state will be

152
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,200
here like R1 and the final state will be

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
here

154
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:49,760
R2 and the entropy uh of the resir will

155
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,959
go from s1r to

156
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
S1 uh

157
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,240
s2r now

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,959
so you would like to give just entropy

159
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,959
to the

160
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,240
reservoir because look so far suppose

161
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,600
you consider here this is the initial

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,760
energy of a and this is the final energy

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,160
of

164
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:26,399
a and we call uh Omega 1

165
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,360
R uh the energy that we transfer to the

166
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
weight so if we could do that

167
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,240
process um ex with without the um use

168
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,640
the need of the reservoir it would be a

169
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,000
weight process for system a and we would

170
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,680
extract this much

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,079
energy okay

172
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,360
but we cannot do it in a weight process

173
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:03,200
because we cannot uh subtract

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,480
uh entropy cannot destroy

175
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,560
entropy so we need to transfer it to the

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,399
res so we need to give it to the resir

177
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,399
and the

178
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,839
reservoir uh in order to accept

179
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,600
entropy you see you would want to move

180
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,160
this initial state of the reservoir to

181
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,640
the right but there are no states to the

182
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,120
right because that's the maximum entropy

183
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,680
for that value for the

184
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:30,040
energy you need to give it also some

185
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,800
energy okay

186
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,800
and that

187
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:40,040
energy is the is the difference between

188
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,040
uh E2 and E1 for the

189
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,040
reservoir

190
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,440
so uh

191
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,440
E2 you last

192
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
subract

193
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,560
that and so all your so you take this

194
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:07,519
segment you put it up here if you

195
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,519
want and it's this

196
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,279
much I mean it's not precise in scale

197
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,600
but this much is that

198
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,560
much so you

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,839
subtract from this energy difference

200
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,680
this energy difference what and what you

201
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:31,240
are left with is

202
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,240
again uh

203
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,720
you see from this point to that

204
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,040
point and that's Omega one R notice that

205
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,200
this point is a geometrical construction

206
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,360
it doesn't correspond to a state because

207
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,920
it's below the stable equum State curve

208
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,600
it's just the construction of bringing

209
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,800
from uh mean translating this energy

210
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,560
difference into there so that I subtract

211
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,160
it from the segment that represents the

212
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,079
difference in energy for the

213
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,040
res and then all I have to do is

214
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,120
remember that

215
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,360
U the stable equilibrium State curve for

216
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:20,079
Reservoir is a straight line

217
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:25,240
so I can rewrite this as t

218
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,240
r time s2r minus

219
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,079
s1r and then I also uh remember that the

220
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,920
amount of entropy that must take that

221
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,720
the restor must take is equal to the

222
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,639
decrease in entropy that I need for my

223
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,639
system so S2 minus

224
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:51,360
S1 uh is equal to uh

225
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:54,360
s S1 a minus

226
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Sr

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,360
a and so we finally

228
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,199
get um the

229
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,959
expression for the available energy that

230
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:10,519
we have uh uh we we want we started with

231
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,519
we wanted to represent

232
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,760
graphically

233
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,399
hey so this brings us uh uh to a very

234
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:33,800
important concept

235
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,279
the uh for applications for applications

236
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,760
in engineering where you want to extract

237
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,920
convert energy from

238
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,079
systems so you need

239
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,079
to and

240
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:52,639
often the systems you start with are in

241
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:55,000
stable equilibrium States maybe hot but

242
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,360
still stable equilibrium

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,120
States for example when you in in a uh

244
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,519
uh steam power plant you just heat up

245
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,279
water you make Steam and that steam is

246
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,040
some sort of a high

247
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:16,480
temperature uh stable equilibrium state

248
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,680
in so here here's the state and you

249
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,720
would like to extract as much energy as

250
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,040
possible so you would like to go down

251
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,480
but going down on the diagram it would

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,800
be any

253
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,880
impossibility I mean a perpetual motion

254
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,800
machine of the second count so it's

255
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
impossible in order to go down in energy

256
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,199
you need to

257
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,199
subtract also

258
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:46,079
some but then you need a

259
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,639
system that takes up that

260
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,959
entropy and usually that role is played

261
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:56,800
by the environment or maybe the nearby

262
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,800
River or or lake or the

263
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,880
sea or the air

264
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,800
that is the system in which

265
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:11,920
you dump the entropy that you must

266
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,440
extract from your

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,279
system okay so it's like an you use the

268
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,279
environment as an entropy

269
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,839
sync but the environment has its own

270
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:28,000
needs uh it uh does not take entropy for

271
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,800
free it takes entropy only if you give

272
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,720
it also enough energy so that it can

273
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,720
climb in the uh stable equilibrium State

274
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
curve

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,480
okay so that energy that you are giving

276
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,440
to the environment in in a in a typical

277
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,279
uh Energy Systems

278
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,120
application is

279
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:57,480
not uh a waste sometimes you say well

280
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,959
I'm wasting energy no no it's it's not

281
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,680
waste you use using the environment for

282
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,920
a very important function you're using

283
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,319
the energy there that's not where the

284
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,800
inefficiency of our your power plant is

285
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,480
the inefficiencies come from the

286
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,839
internal irreversibilities that are in

287
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,360
your

288
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,079
Machinery instead the

289
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,440
role

290
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:27,920
um the role of the of the r work here uh

291
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,199
is uh is important because otherwise it

292
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,240
wouldn't uh uh you you wouldn't be able

293
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,839
to do anything

294
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,199
useful yeah we'll we'll come back to

295
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:45,279
this when I do a quick review of heat

296
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,560
engines uh and uh exy stuff in in a

297
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,079
couple of

298
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,560
lectures okay but

299
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,360
today I want

300
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,839
to go into some

301
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:03,519
details on how we um

302
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,199
uh show that uh for systems to be mutual

303
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,640
equilibrium you need the quality of

304
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,079
temperatures when they can exchange

305
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,959
energy you need the quality of pressures

306
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,439
when they can exchange volume you need

307
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,679
quality of chemical potentials of the

308
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,720
various constituents for those

309
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,160
constituents that can be transferred

310
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:27,240
from one system to the

311
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:29,880
other and the way we prove this is by

312
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,679
means of the uh Max maimum entropy

313
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,080
principle you remember that we proved

314
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,080
that

315
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,799
U the stable equilibrium

316
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,640
state is the maximum entropy one among

317
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,960
those states that have the same energy

318
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,240
and amounts and parameters I'm not going

319
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,799
to repeat amounts and parameters let's

320
00:17:49,240 --> 00:18:00,440
keep them fixed for the entire day so

321
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:04,159
how does we how do does the proof um um

322
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:09,280
work you say all right let's start from

323
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,960
two systems A and B that are in mutual

324
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,120
equilibrium therefore the composite

325
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,000
system C this is the E versus S diagram

326
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,000
of the composite system of the

327
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:29,799
two so the composite system is in

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,159
um is on the stable State curve because

329
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,400
um by definition of mutual equilibrium

330
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,440
it's when the two systems the composite

331
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,360
is inable

332
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,200
equili

333
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,400
okay so now what we do is all right

334
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,640
let's construct another state we'll call

335
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,280
it

336
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,280
C1 is the same

337
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,480
energy uh but a different

338
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,880
state being a different state with the

339
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,880
same energy it necessarily has a lesser

340
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,760
entropy okay we have many choices for

341
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:12,360
this other state C1 so we are going to

342
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,360
choose one that is easy for us in some

343
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,320
sense so for

344
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,240
example here's my system a here's my

345
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,159
system

346
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,400
B uh in the mutual equilibrium state so

347
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:33,880
now these are the the

348
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,080
the partial the the local um energy

349
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,640
entropy

350
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,280
diagrams sometimes I forget to write the

351
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,960
es because I give it for granted but I

352
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,720
shouldn't all

353
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,520
right uh so let's say that this is

354
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,000
temperature

355
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,120
t0 of system a and this is temperature

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,320
t0 of system

357
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:01,039
B and we were going to we want to prove

358
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,960
so I build it in already in the in this

359
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
construction that the two temperatures

360
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,480
must

361
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,480
be okay so I

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,559
start

363
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,039
from uh them being in a stable equum

364
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,559
State and then I consider another state

365
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,559
which is this

366
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,840
one with the same energy for the

367
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:30,440
composite but different for the parts so

368
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:34,720
let's see uh I've put let me arbitrarily

369
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:39,280
choose a a small amount of energy

370
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:43,280
de and therefore assume that uh my

371
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,919
system a I'll make it bigger so as to

372
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:52,039
presentent it it's as an

373
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,880
energy um Higher by by an amount

374
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:59,240
de and

375
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,440
B as an energy smaller by the same

376
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,200
amount so that since energy is additive

377
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,320
the total energy remains constant and

378
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,039
therefore the composite system it still

379
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,400
has the same

380
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,279
energy plus I mean I I have many choices

381
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,120
on how to do this but I'm going to

382
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:20,679
choose the easy way easy for our proof

383
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,200
so that uh both system a and system

384
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:27,400
B change their energies but the

385
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,400
remaining stable equum state

386
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:37,039
right so this is how I construct State

387
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,520
uh A1 and B1 so as to make up the

388
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
composite

389
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:49,960
C1 um since I want to do

390
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:55,440
um also equality of pressure I want to

391
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,440
prove also that think also of the

392
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,840
volume that changes so this become said

393
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,240
three-dimensional surface I'm not going

394
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,440
to represent it otherwise it gets too

395
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,159
messy but

396
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,880
imagine um that in addition to changing

397
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:15,159
the energy I'm also going to change the

398
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,919
volume

399
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:22,279
so the partition

400
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,279
between uh system A and B are is movable

401
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,559
and let let's move the uh the partition

402
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:32,320
to slightly to the right so that a gains

403
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:37,440
a little volume DV and B uh yields a

404
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:40,080
little volume DV okay so now we

405
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,080
constructed this state C1 that has the

406
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,360
same energy and also the same volume for

407
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,360
system

408
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:54,240
C

409
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:59,080
okay and what we want to uh um make use

410
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:02,679
of is the fact that the maximum ENT so

411
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:06,360
that that the entropy of um of C in

412
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:10,760
state zero is greater than that in say

413
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:15,440
in C1 so that I can write it this

414
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:19,520
way S1 C minus S10 must be less than Z

415
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,120
okay so we start we want to compute this

416
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,480
and the end we end up uh uh imposing

417
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,559
that it is it must be

418
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,000
negative okay then

419
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,840
the next steps are simply using the

420
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,840
additivity of

421
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,480
entropy so in state initial and final

422
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:43,720
State the entropy of C is the sum of the

423
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,720
entropies of A and

424
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,200
B just uh rearrange so that it's the

425
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320
additivity of the entropy

426
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,799
differences and then because of our

427
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,880
construction because we selected this

428
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,640
particular stage that U uh uh still

429
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,080
belong to the stable equilibrium State

430
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:08,559
curve we can use a tailor series

431
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,720
expansion of the fundamental relation

432
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:15,600
which describes this curve to represent

433
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,600
uh how the entropy changes for the

434
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,200
subsystems you

435
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:30,000
remember um let's see yeah we had the s

436
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,520
or stable

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,840
equilibrium is a function like that and

438
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,840
if I want to to

439
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,840
compute

440
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,440
uh the value of

441
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,600
uh so this represents this curve so if I

442
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,880
want to

443
00:24:52,600 --> 00:25:02,039
compute uh the difference of say

444
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,720
S2 minus S one this being State one and

445
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,120
this being state

446
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,919
two or actually sorry let let's make it

447
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,919
zero and

448
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,559
one so S1 minus s z right that's what we

449
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,559
want

450
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,399
yeah I can do a stor series

451
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,200
expansion uh around the initial State

452
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:31,559
the initial point of the the function so

453
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,559
around

454
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:39,600
e0 so it will be let me do it only for

455
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,679
as if it were only a function of energy

456
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,919
so this is like forget about these ones

457
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:49,240
for the moment so that would be

458
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,880
S of uh

459
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,640
e0

460
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:58,399
plus uh S

461
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,760
Prime of e0 times

462
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:07,120
E1 minus

463
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:10,000
e0 plus s double Prime uh divided by

464
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,279
two or two factorial whatever it's the

465
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,679
same times E1 minus

466
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,200
e0 squared plus dot dot dot and the

467
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,200
series

468
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,159
continues of course in the limit as a as

469
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,320
the E1 minus e0 is B the first uh the

470
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,039
the dominant terms are the the first

471
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,679
ones that you find in the expansion so

472
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:39,000
that's what we are doing here with the

473
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,520
notion that this S Prime is what we call

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,520
the inverse

475
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,279
temperature and when you do this also in

476
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:50,159
terms of the second variable is the

477
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,159
volume that's what we called pressure

478
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,520
over

479
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,520
temperature so here is

480
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,840
the that expans f for system

481
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:03,840
a the second

482
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,520
derivatives um let me write them as

483
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,039
D2 because it it contains several terms

484
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,159
since I'm doing that in terms of two

485
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:19,520
varibles

486
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,640
subsequent slide will have the details

487
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,399
and we do the same for system

488
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,840
B then we use the

489
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:33,480
fact well then we combine terms

490
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:40,240
and uh here is what we get 1 / T minus 1

491
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:44,320
/ t for B A and D * D p/ T minus p/ t a

492
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,919
DB plus the second uh differentials so

493
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,919
as plus dos dos

494
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,919
dos

495
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:58,640
okay so what can we infer and this must

496
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,519
be negative strictly negative

497
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,399
of

498
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,440
course notice and remember that when you

499
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,279
do a series expansion the

500
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,480
first the terms here like this one are

501
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:15,640
evaluated at the initial State okay so

502
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,720
they do not depend on uh how much you

503
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,679
move

504
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,760
around

505
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,120
so these terms in parenthesis and that

506
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,519
term is s parenthesis is

507
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:33,480
fixed by the initial state state zero

508
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,080
it's independent of how you move around

509
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,240
to another state so it's dependent on De

510
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
and

511
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,159
DV and on the other

512
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,559
hand you see here I could have chosen to

513
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,799
give to like uh to choose another state

514
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,559
of a with higher energy but also one

515
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,960
with lower energy so I could have chosen

516
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,000
de to be positive or

517
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,559
negative large or small positive or

518
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,679
negative whatever as long as of course b

519
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:11,519
gets the opposite equal and

520
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:16,720
opposite so that means that de and DV

521
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,720
can be chosen arbitrarily positive or

522
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,600
negative and if if these terms in

523
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,679
parenthesis were different than zero

524
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,039
suppose they were

525
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,080
positive then I could choose a positive

526
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,000
de and this would be a dominating term

527
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,000
in the

528
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,720
series violating the fact that that

529
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,559
sound must be

530
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,360
negative so the only possibility due to

531
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,760
the arbitrariness of the choice of DV

532
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,919
and de is that these terms in

533
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,919
parenthesis be equal to

534
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,039
zero and of course then the burden to

535
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,960
keep the inequality

536
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,960
satisfied is going to be shifted to the

537
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,080
second order terms in the expansion

538
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,919
which are going to be

539
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,840
negative right

540
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:09,440
so essentially what we proved here is

541
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,000
that in order for that system here to be

542
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,919
in a a stable equilibrium State the two

543
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,559
temperatures must be

544
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,559
equal and also the two pressures must be

545
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,200
equal so above here is the same as

546
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:35,000
before uh I simply wrote more

547
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,760
explicitly the expression for the um

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,760
second order

549
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,880
differential which

550
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:46,559
is uh must be nonp positive so it's

551
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,200
either zero or

552
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,559
negative if it is zero it's the third

553
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,760
order terms and fourth and and and go on

554
00:30:52,559 --> 00:31:02,399
uh that must uh obey must be take up uh

555
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,080
uh uh and satisfy this Inequality For

556
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,799
example see if I have a

557
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,720
reservoir the second derivative is equal

558
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,679
to

559
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,919
zero of the the fundamental relation so

560
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,279
for this Reservoir I need that somewhere

561
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:23,760
in along the the line

562
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:29,720
uh the there is a derivative which is

563
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,720
negative and uh since

564
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:36,279
a straight line isn't like that it means

565
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,000
that the this straight line in practice

566
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:42,799
is really an approximation so in other

567
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,080
words a real Reservoir with a true

568
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,919
straight line as a stable equum State

569
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,919
curve cannot exist it would violate this

570
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,760
so so the the the reservoir is is an

571
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,399
approximation extremely good

572
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,960
approximation if you make it uh uh like

573
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,080
water at the triple point with

574
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,080
sufficient amount of water but if you go

575
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,760
to small very small uh

576
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,240
amounts uh then you may have

577
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,240
difficulties uh constructing a real uh

578
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,880
Reservoir

579
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,559
okay so we proved the I mean equality of

580
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,000
temperature and quality of pressure and

581
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,200
we proved

582
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,200
also the sign of the second derivatives

583
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,480
of this uh of the fundamental

584
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,919
relation the reason why I have drawn the

585
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,639
E sucess diagram this way and not the

586
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:45,399
other way so with the concavity

587
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,679
upward is now proved

588
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:50,880
here the second derivative of s with

589
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,679
respect to e is negative or zero

590
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,840
negative or

591
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,799
zero the same you can

592
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,960
prove since this form differential form

593
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:06,799
must be negative for all possible values

594
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:11,799
uh you uh you

595
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,679
need that the it's a it's a quadratic

596
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:15,639
form and you need that the the

597
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,679
coefficient The Matrix of coefficients

598
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:21,399
be positive uh I meaning negative

599
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,639
definite or actually non positive

600
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,760
definite meaning that for example not

601
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:29,399
only the terms on the diagonal which are

602
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,000
these two but also so the determinant

603
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:35,519
must be non negative I mean non

604
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,360
positive okay so which gives us also

605
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:43,200
this expression

606
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:46,799
here okay now uh we can do also but more

607
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,399
quickly the proof for

608
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,480
when instead of

609
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:56,320
um yeah here um instead of putting the

610
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,000
the movable piston I should have um I

611
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,360
must change this um um drawing this

612
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,880
should be should be replaced with a

613
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,880
porous

614
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,720
material not nonmovable so this is

615
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,040
should be a porous

616
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:18,520
material that would um allow the

617
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,040
transfer of constituent I of so of

618
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:25,040
molecules of atoms of typ I only one

619
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
time

620
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,919
so they are in mutual equilibrium at the

621
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,760
big a state

622
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:39,720
zero and we construct a state uh another

623
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:45,720
state with the same energy by shifting

624
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:49,320
some energy from A to B and also some

625
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:53,079
amounts so I I give a I take a with some

626
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:56,320
more uh particles all that type and Me

627
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:59,640
by the less particle so it's like moving

628
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,640
them from from B to a

629
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,480
well exactly the same procedure I'm

630
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,880
going to exploit the fact that the

631
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,720
entropy of S1 must be less than that of

632
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,240
S

633
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,920
zero only that when I do the series

634
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,119
expansion okay for the energy it's still

635
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,720
the same but um now I'm not I'm not

636
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,480
changing the volume and changing the

637
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:30,960
amount so instead of p/ T the partial

638
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,920
derivative with respect to Amounts is

639
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,920
minus the chemical potential

640
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,960
overt combine in the same

641
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,119
way and this

642
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:51,359
term by the arbitrariness of our choice

643
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:55,480
of system C1 of say of State C1 so the

644
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,960
amounts dni the difference are

645
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,760
arbitrary like the energy and therefore

646
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,359
we find the same conclusion that these

647
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,359
coefficients must be uh

648
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:15,119
zero and uh of course also that second

649
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,280
uh order differential must must be non

650
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,760
positive we prove therefore that we need

651
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,440
the equality of temperature and equality

652
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,800
of the chemical potentials of that

653
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,400
constituent in the two

654
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,079
systems for Mutual equilibrium and we we

655
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,040
prove some

656
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,040
other convexity or concavity

657
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,640
relations in fact if you do it for

658
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,599
several

659
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,599
variables you end up with the fact that

660
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,800
uh uh all these second derivatives must

661
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
be

662
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:03,000
zero but more than that

663
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:07,280
uh this Matrix which is the H Matrix of

664
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,680
uh partial all the possible second order

665
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,200
partial derivatives uh must

666
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:18,480
be negative definite or negative semi

667
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:22,280
definite and U and uh and therefore you

668
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,680
can apply all your uh all that you know

669
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,680
about positive definite matrices and so

670
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:33,599
on and obtain the number of

671
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,480
inequalities for example from some of

672
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,280
these uh one of these inequalities that

673
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,720
is is well known is that the specific

674
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,319
heat of a substance which is related to

675
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,839
the second derivative of s with respect

676
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:48,839
to e uh must be

677
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,839
posit but as you see

678
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:59,319
here the the there's only one result you

679
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,319
can you could obtain

680
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,319
several

681
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,119
okay now by the same

682
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,880
technique to prove the inequalities we

683
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,839
can also prove um another interesting

684
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,760
relation which is known as the Y

685
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,839
plus uh equation for a surface tension

686
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,640
so let me do

687
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:31,000
um this because um it's po so useful for

688
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,440
those of

689
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,760
you who are in the fluid mechanics or

690
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,760
mechanics of interfaces for example

691
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:48,119
take the

692
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:53,119
system which is a which contains a

693
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:58,720
drop so this stands for drop say of

694
00:38:53,119 --> 00:39:04,560
uh h of one phase

695
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,560
in immerse or surrounded by another

696
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,839
phase and there are many examples here

697
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,400
and just put three of

698
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:16,160
them it could be let's start with the

699
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,200
last one it could be liquid and

700
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,440
Vapor so a drop of liquid and outside

701
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,680
you got Vapor like water VAP or VAP of

702
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,680
any

703
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,720
substance or or you you could have a

704
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,079
like

705
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,839
air on the

706
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,880
outside uh which is partially dissolved

707
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:40,160
here's a drop of water in which there is

708
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,560
some air

709
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,040
dissolved it's not air like CO2 or some

710
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,480
other

711
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,000
substance or you could have two liquids

712
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:54,599
like oil and water that are not missible

713
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,079
so in the bulk of each one you don't

714
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:02,480
find uh any of the other

715
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,720
but in the interfacial

716
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:11,040
region they

717
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,040
must U live together these different

718
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:18,200
molecules so in this region the

719
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,280
properties of this layer which is

720
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,520
generally very

721
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:28,800
thin and therefore you can uh these

722
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:33,000
properties uh of the substance uh feel

723
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,440
the different um forces intermolecular

724
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,400
forces than any of the two BS because

725
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,000
here you have just forces

726
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,560
between the's say gray molecules here

727
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,839
you have

728
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,280
U just intermolecular forces of the the

729
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:51,560
dark molecules and here you have some

730
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,839
and

731
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,839
some so they are really different

732
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,839
systems

733
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,720
and the fact that the the interface is

734
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,800
interfacial region is is is generally

735
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,280
very very thin allows you to model it

736
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,960
you can model it of course in a

737
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,720
continuous

738
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,960
way but here we're going to do it uh uh

739
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,359
like when you do Anga plus equation you

740
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,720
model it in a much simpler way as if it

741
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:28,400
was just

742
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,400
another very thin system

743
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,599
uh when which which can exchange

744
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:40,640
molecules uh on both

745
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:45,000
sides but on the right it can exchange

746
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,720
only dark molecule on the left only gray

747
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,960
molecules whereas the situation in which

748
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:55,560
you have coexistence of the two can only

749
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,560
move uh along the surface in a 2d

750
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:03,160
geometry

751
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:06,200
so it's it's only by moving along this

752
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:10,480
um Circle here if it is if it is a

753
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,760
spherical uh geometry that you can find

754
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,680
this

755
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,680
coexisting uh

756
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,480
situation and it it's the same kind of

757
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,920
idea when you have

758
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,760
a phase separation when you when the

759
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,440
system in order to reach stable

760
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:36,720
equilibrium doesn't

761
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:40,040
um doesn't find it um um doesn't find

762
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,800
the maximum entropy state by by

763
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,119
remaining homogeneous but it separates

764
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,559
so

765
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,760
molecules like to go uh to bump to each

766
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,480
other and become a liquid on one side

767
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,480
and on the other side you got the water

768
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,119
we the interface

769
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:04,599
interfacial region is a very very thin

770
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:07,240
region in which the density changes

771
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,240
drastically now the factor of a thousand

772
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,640
is the density difference between the

773
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,880
liquid and the vapor like for example

774
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,960
for

775
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:22,839
water so the density drops in a

776
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:26,119
matter of a uh few

777
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,960
uh what is

778
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,800
it

779
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,640
nanometers uh

780
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:38,079
drops uh it drops uh by a factor of a

781
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:42,520
th all right

782
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,520
so if we have a system like

783
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:50,760
this it's

784
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,680
confined on a layer so its extension is

785
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,640
not measured in terms of

786
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:01,160
thickness but it's only in terms of the

787
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:04,559
surface area where it can uh

788
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,359
develop so for that system the parameter

789
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,559
of the

790
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:12,559
geometrical

791
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:15,680
um container or or let's say mental

792
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,000
container that uh where those mod

793
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,559
molecules are

794
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,720
confined uh is not the

795
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:25,200
volume but it's it's the surface

796
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,520
area or if you want it is still the

797
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,839
volume but the volume can be split in

798
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,839
the surface area and a very thin

799
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:41,440
layer so area of the surface becomes a

800
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,040
parameter for that

801
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:50,960
system which plays a parallel

802
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:56,480
role all that played by volume for M

803
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:58,599
systems and like we Define p over the

804
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,319
the partial derivative of fundamental

805
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:02,079
from the stable equilibrium state of

806
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,079
fundamental relation with respect to

807
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,079
volume we call it P /

808
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:12,040
t for this particular

809
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:16,680
system the derivative of s with respect

810
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,680
to a we call it minus Sigma /

811
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,880
T and if

812
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,400
we invert the function we see that you

813
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,359
can see like the for the bul system the

814
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,760
pressure is minus the derivative of the

815
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:36,280
uh energy with respect to to volume of

816
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:40,800
the uh energy form of the fundamental

817
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,520
relation and for the interface system

818
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,720
it's the sigma the surface we call it

819
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,839
surface tension is the partial of the

820
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,599
energy with respect to a with without a

821
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,240
minus sign that's why one is a pressure

822
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,880
the other is a tension

823
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,119
so okay so that that is for the

824
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,200
definition

825
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,520
so now we can play the

826
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,680
same uh

827
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,680
role the same U

828
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,760
trick of applying the maximum entropy

829
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,680
principle to see what happens at Mutual

830
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:20,000
equilibrium between those three

831
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:21,960
phases those three systems b d and the

832
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,599
interface

833
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:30,440
C and the trick is to construct another

834
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:33,160
state we call it F1 because now I'm

835
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:37,040
running out of letters so

836
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:40,160
f is the composite system of B CD so

837
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,520
this overall system is

838
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:48,960
f I'm not using letter A because now a

839
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:53,000
is the area so that's uh used up okay so

840
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:56,000
uh so we need to construct another

841
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,040
state and the way we do it is by

842
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,119
changing

843
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,240
we do it in a particular

844
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:07,079
Way by

845
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,079
changing um the

846
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:15,640
shape per perturbing the the the shape

847
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,640
of the original uh drop

848
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:27,079
in and then we proceed in the same

849
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:29,800
way we have uh we

850
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:32,160
we want to prove that this thing is

851
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,760
negative there is a yeah there is

852
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,280
negative here is the minus the

853
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,359
negative

854
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,599
sign we apply additivity we now have

855
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,599
three

856
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,720
systems so the

857
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,319
one

858
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:56,559
uh B and D are like we done before but

859
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:58,760
now we have also system C for which uh

860
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,960
the Tor series expansion in the first

861
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,240
terms in the expansion uh contain the

862
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,359
surface

863
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:13,559
tension of course it's the value like

864
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:15,599
the pressure evaluated at the um stable

865
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,160
equum State

866
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,079
F0 here the dots represent many things

867
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,960
they represent also I should have

868
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:25,640
written also but I didn't have space

869
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,760
enough on The View graph the derivative

870
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,760
will check to the amount

871
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,960
and the second order

872
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:41,160
terms but in order to focus on on the

873
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:43,280
interesting part new part let me

874
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,839
choose a

875
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,960
particular

876
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:54,640
uh situation in which this very

877
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:54,640
particular value state as1 in which

878
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,400
uh I have U Already

879
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,240
satisfied the temperature

880
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,680
equality

881
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,640
condition I already satisfied the the

882
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,640
chemical potential

883
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:18,960
equality and so all I am interested in

884
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:23,119
is changing the

885
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,280
volume okay so that allows us to

886
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,240
essentially concentrate on these three

887
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,680
terms this one

888
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,680
that one and that

889
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,720
one and by getting rid of uh yeah there

890
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,640
was there should be a one / T here that

891
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,920
disappeared I have to fix also that on

892
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,200
the do

893
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,200
graph uh

894
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:51,720
P because these temperatures are assumed

895
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:56,359
to be equal so I'm left with this

896
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:59,680
equation and this equation has to be uh

897
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,680
NE negative strictly

898
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:07,480
negative but as we will find out is

899
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:12,480
that again because of the arbitrarily

900
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:18,200
arbitrariness of uh the choices of U the

901
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:21,880
change in in the geometry in the

902
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:24,440
volume it will turn out to have to be

903
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,359
zero and so the burden for the

904
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:34,160
inequality will be uh uh carried by the

905
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:36,680
extra uh additional terms

906
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,920
okay all

907
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,920
right so yes uh again also here I have

908
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,760
to fix the view graph so this is just

909
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,200
smaller to make room for something

910
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:52,000
else uh all right so now there is an

911
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,000
easy way of proceeding here is assume a

912
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,799
geometry if we assume a geometry just to

913
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,680
see what what comes out

914
00:50:57,799 --> 00:51:02,839
so if you assume for example spherical

915
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,839
geometry of the

916
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:12,599
drop and we assume that we uh change the

917
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:15,720
volume so we we consider a perturbed

918
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:17,720
state with a volume slightly

919
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:21,599
increased by an

920
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:24,680
amount if R was the radius of the drop

921
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,799
it becomes R plus Dr or the Epsilon

922
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,520
Epsilon to stress the fact that it's

923
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:35,079
small

924
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:37,240
okay okay so the area of U of the

925
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:40,240
interface of the surface of the sphere

926
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,240
is 4 pi r

927
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,559
squ the volume that is

928
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:54,520
the if if I increase this the sphere

929
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,119
from this solid light to the dash line

930
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,760
the increase in volume is is equal to

931
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:05,240
the surface the area

932
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:07,640
times uh the shift in so times the

933
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,440
Epsilon so that's

934
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:13,880
DV and that's what happens what appears

935
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,880
in this part of the

936
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:21,160
equation also the since I am um going

937
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:24,280
from small to large also the area

938
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:28,680
changes now the area changes

939
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:34,359
because the radius uh is changed so I go

940
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:37,359
from 4 pi r 2 to 4 pi r + D

941
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:37,359
Epsilon

942
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,559
squared

943
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,799
and if I forget about the D Epsilon

944
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,000
Square because it's small with respect

945
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:50,839
to the put it to the

946
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,280
others what I'm left

947
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:58,440
is so one of these cancels with that I'm

948
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,440
left left with 8 pi r

949
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:05,000
V and this is the change in area that I

950
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:10,440
put

951
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,240
here still the the Epsilon is

952
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,440
arbitrary so that expression now becomes

953
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,119
this

954
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,200
expression and it should be equal to

955
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,440
zero for I mean negative for arbitary

956
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,640
values of the

957
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,920
Epsilon they could have chosen also the

958
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:29,839
Epsilon negative instead of positive

959
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,839
and still that should be satisfied so

960
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,680
essentially it's just what multiplies

961
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:39,680
the Epsilon that has to be

962
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:41,559
zero so the 4 pi r squ r 4 pi r cancels

963
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,040
and you get this expression here there

964
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:46,400
is a two that uh emerges from the 8

965
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,400
divided by

966
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,440
four and so you find that the condition

967
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,799
for Mutual equilibrium between those

968
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,000
three systems is that the pressure in

969
00:53:53,799 --> 00:54:00,240
the inside the drop must differ

970
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,359
must be greater than the pressure uh of

971
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,440
the

972
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:08,920
outside by the surface tension

973
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,920
multiplied by 2/

974
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:16,440
R now if you repeat that for a

975
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:21,440
cylindrical

976
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:24,000
shape we just keep that but here are the

977
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,880
details uh you get a similar expression

978
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,520
only with one / r

979
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:34,240
okay but the true

980
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,240
story is that

981
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:41,240
uh we don't know this shape so we we

982
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,799
shouldn't in principle assume that

983
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,799
shape

984
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,799
because

985
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,920
uh in principle who who tells us that uh

986
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,119
the shape should be spherical or

987
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,960
geometri or or

988
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:02,599
cylindrical that is also a

989
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:05,640
result of this maximum entropy principle

990
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,720
and the young La

991
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,400
plus

992
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:15,599
it it's a bit complicated so Ian it took

993
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:18,000
me days to construct this uh these u

994
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,920
pictures so I'm not going to spend too

995
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,960
much time on them but simply uh I assume

996
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,400
that you know that if I have a surface

997
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,359
space uh I can can define principal radi

998
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,880
of

999
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:39,960
curvature and uh there like in a

1000
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:44,160
sphere or in ellipsoid you could have uh

1001
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,720
the centers of curvature on the same

1002
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,640
side of the

1003
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:52,559
surface but in a subtle point or of your

1004
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,480
surface you could have the centers of

1005
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:59,119
cure on the two opposite sides so for

1006
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,119
example so suppose this is the

1007
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,839
drop in this

1008
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:06,839
situation you have one Center of

1009
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:11,599
curvature inside the drop and one

1010
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:11,599
outside whereas here they're both

1011
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,599
inside and uh but you see this is a

1012
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,039
local

1013
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,720
picture if you have an arbitrary shape

1014
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,720
you suppose if you have a drop of

1015
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:31,440
arbitrary shape like for example when

1016
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:35,640
you have a a drop of water in gravity

1017
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,640
field uh you know this is the

1018
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:39,880
shape uh

1019
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:46,359
so the local

1020
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,920
curvature and the the surface must be

1021
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:52,520
represented somehow by running over the

1022
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,839
entire surface with local variables and

1023
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,480
integrating so in order to calculate the

1024
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:58,480
entire area you have to do an

1025
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:05,520
integral of these uh local

1026
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,240
areas so here is a lot of uh uh

1027
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,920
Expressions that I hope are correct that

1028
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:16,000
allows you that um describe this um

1029
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:19,200
geometrical uh situations

1030
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,079
one for the system when the two centers

1031
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,200
are on the two sides of the surface and

1032
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,520
one for this the case in which they are

1033
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,240
on both on the same side

1034
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,680
the the

1035
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,520
difference is it

1036
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,319
locally the the purpose of these

1037
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,760
formulas here is to

1038
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:43,079
compute the

1039
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:46,200
ratio of the area change to the volume

1040
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:48,160
change as you shift to see remember that

1041
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,920
we were talking about this situation we

1042
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:57,200
want to um perturb the shape of of the

1043
00:57:52,920 --> 00:58:00,520
drop and go to uh a

1044
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:04,319
another state and we comp we want to

1045
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:07,559
compute the volume and the area so the

1046
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:10,520
what is important is the ratio of the

1047
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:14,960
area change over the volume change and

1048
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:17,400
that's why here we uh we compute it for

1049
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,720
locally so as I

1050
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:25,559
perturb uh the move the the surface that

1051
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:30,400
entails a Chang in volume Delta V and a

1052
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:33,079
changing surface area Delta a and they

1053
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:37,839
and this ratio is related to the inverse

1054
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:40,000
it's called the uh mean local

1055
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:42,359
curvature it's the sum of two

1056
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,960
contributions but it is an algebraic sum

1057
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:50,119
because one of the U when the radius out

1058
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,319
is on the other side it has a negative

1059
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:54,839
in

1060
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:58,079
front Okay so if we go back to our

1061
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:02,680
picture here and try TR to

1062
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:06,079
compute these areas and this uh changing

1063
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,319
volume we have to integrate somehow over

1064
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,760
the entire

1065
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:13,200
surface that's why I need a double

1066
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:17,440
integral over some variables so Theta

1067
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:21,680
one and Theta 2 maybe is a is a way to

1068
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,680
describe a local uh

1069
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,319
angles and uh

1070
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,280
and then if you okay if you go on and do

1071
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:35,839
all the the math you calculate again the

1072
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,799
change in area it's again R plus the

1073
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:41,200
Epsilon and

1074
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:43,920
R now it's plus or minus the Epsilon

1075
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:50,160
because when you when you move the

1076
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:52,640
surface on one side in this case uh

1077
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,359
um one

1078
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,799
radius of curvature increases and the

1079
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:00,520
other decrease

1080
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:04,680
phes by the amount the

1081
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:08,240
EP and so uh in the

1082
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,280
end you get a double

1083
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,680
integral over

1084
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:15,240
the surface

1085
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:18,880
coordinates and the D

1086
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,119
Epsilon now you you you can choose

1087
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,680
arbitrarily the D Epsilon at every

1088
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,880
location in the in the in the

1089
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,599
surface and that's arbitrary so that

1090
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:34,119
integral must be equal to

1091
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:37,240
zero for arbitrary choices of how you

1092
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:37,240
want to distribute the

1093
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:46,000
epsilons which says that therefore is

1094
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,000
the integrand that must be equal to

1095
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:55,920
zero and so you find that you can

1096
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:55,920
rewrite it this way

1097
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:05,039
and you find that therefore the sum of

1098
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,640
the of the inverse of the radi of

1099
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,960
curvature so the mean

1100
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,680
curvature which in principle could be

1101
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,240
different

1102
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:18,079
locally from point to

1103
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,480
point must be equal to this ratio of

1104
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,119
difference in

1105
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:26,799
pressure and different and surface

1106
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:30,760
tension which is something that uh

1107
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,760
that doesn't depend on location of the

1108
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:41,000
ccle so that means so this

1109
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:44,559
result means that the the average uh

1110
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,119
curvature must be uniform must be equal

1111
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,599
everywhere on the surface when you are

1112
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,599
in mutual

1113
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,400
equilibrium like in a

1114
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,440
sphere like in a cylindrical situation

1115
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:02,760
there are some

1116
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:06,000
other uh interesting surfaces if you

1117
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:11,079
look up in u the

1118
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:13,960
Wikipedia um surfaces of the uh constant

1119
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:18,200
mean curvature you find that somebody

1120
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,200
has found a very interesting shape

1121
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:26,240
where it's a more complicated than a

1122
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:28,680
than than a sphere all right Plus of

1123
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,359
course so this is the main result the

1124
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:34,839
uniformity of the mean curvature and

1125
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:37,960
this is the standard uh Yang plus

1126
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:42,079
equation for where system for a for a

1127
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:44,319
surface with the two uh different radi

1128
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,319
of uh

1129
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,319
curvish

1130
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:58,599
okay okay so now we are already

1131
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:01,839
for the next

1132
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:04,799
move we want to prove the Claus

1133
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:08,079
statement of the

1134
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:11,319
second so we want to capitalize now on

1135
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:14,160
the fact that a

1136
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:17,920
system

1137
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,920
uh systems can

1138
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:22,720
exchange energy and entropy

1139
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:32,359
and we would like to consider this

1140
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:37,000
particular situation two systems A and

1141
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:37,000
B initially in stable equilibrium

1142
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:44,880
States uh for Simplicity for the moment

1143
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,880
we just consider fixed volume fixed

1144
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:54,240
amounts and we want to transfer uh some

1145
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,240
energy from one to the

1146
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:01,720
other the question question is is it

1147
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,720
always possible or when is it

1148
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,960
possible do I me do I need to transfer

1149
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:12,880
also some entropy in order to make it

1150
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:18,160
possible okay so that's the question

1151
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:20,599
answered by the Claus uh the the

1152
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,960
inequalities that we will uh that we

1153
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:26,279
will uh prove right

1154
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,480
now so look

1155
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:32,039
it's again the same story as we started

1156
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,559
with if my system a starts in a stable

1157
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:37,400
equilibrium State here and I want to

1158
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:41,319
extract energy so that I give it to

1159
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:43,359
system B I need to go down in energy but

1160
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:46,599
in order to go down in energy I also

1161
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,599
need to go down in

1162
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,720
ENT so the so already from the picture

1163
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,480
we

1164
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,000
see a geometric

1165
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:03,359
proof we will we will have view graphs

1166
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
that do that more detail but also more

1167
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:09,520
complicated

1168
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,599
uh but first let's do it with

1169
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:16,359
equations so how do we Model A system we

1170
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,359
make energy balances and entropy

1171
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:24,039
balances and

1172
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:27,000
uh let's consider a small change in uh

1173
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:29,520
in a small amount of energy

1174
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,640
transferred all right so if I

1175
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,559
make the energy balance for system a

1176
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,400
simply says that the rate I mean that

1177
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:42,359
the change in the energy of a is uh

1178
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:45,240
equal to uh minus the amount that I uh

1179
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:49,680
gave to B that I extracted from

1180
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:52,799
a and for system B its energy change is

1181
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:57,359
equal to the amount that it

1182
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:57,359
received notice the arrows

1183
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:04,960
uh the arrows tell you when

1184
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:07,319
these uh symbols are positive it means

1185
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,680
that the flow has been in the direction

1186
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:09,680
of the

1187
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,279
arrow entropy

1188
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,559
balance the change in the entropy of

1189
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:26,279
system

1190
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:28,880
a okay as it goes uh to the left

1191
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:32,160
is equal to two contributions one is the

1192
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,680
entropy that has been transferred out of

1193
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,760
system

1194
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:40,039
a and the other if any is the entropy

1195
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,400
that has been produced by

1196
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:44,680
irreversibility Within systa if the

1197
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,839
process is

1198
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:51,200
irreversible if you do it reversibly

1199
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:54,079
this one isn't there but if you do it

1200
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,559
irreversibly this one this term must be

1201
01:06:54,079 --> 01:07:00,079
greater than zero

1202
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,720
for system B the entropy balance says

1203
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:07,440
that the change in the entropy of

1204
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:11,799
B is equal to the entropy that it

1205
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:17,400
received from a plus if any the entropy

1206
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:17,400
that was generated Within Me by the

1207
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:23,480
RSE

1208
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,480
now again

1209
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:32,760
uh this is State uh

1210
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,920
A1

1211
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:47,799
that's and we

1212
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:50,920
moved we extracted this much

1213
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:56,960
energy I call it Delta

1214
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,960
E A out of a it goes into B

1215
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:05,119
okay if

1216
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:08,559
I I do not

1217
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:11,640
necessarily uh have to go to the stable

1218
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,839
equilibrium State I could go to any of

1219
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,839
these

1220
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,279
states and

1221
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,799
principle well maybe maybe I cannot go

1222
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:26,640
all that far but that will depend

1223
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:29,719
because if I want to go this far I need

1224
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,400
a system on the other side that since I

1225
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:34,679
reduce the entropy I need a system that

1226
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:37,440
picks up that entropies it it has to

1227
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:40,799
have uh the ability to do

1228
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:45,000
that so at a certain stage we will uh

1229
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,159
see that we cannot go too far uh uh to

1230
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,440
the

1231
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:57,440
left but in any case these are the

1232
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:57,440
possible changes of state of system a

1233
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:07,480
what I know is that the stable

1234
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,279
equilibrium State for the new value of

1235
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,199
the energy is the one that has the

1236
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:15,600
highest

1237
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:16,759
entr so gain maximum entropy PR so the

1238
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,799
entropy

1239
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:23,239
S2 of the find the entropy of State A2

1240
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:27,880
suppose that's this

1241
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:29,480
one is less then the uh maximum entropy

1242
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,920
corresponding to that value of the

1243
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,000
energy which is the entropy of the

1244
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,520
stable equilibrium

1245
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,759
State corresponding

1246
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:44,719
to the new value of the

1247
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:48,319
energy okay so here

1248
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:51,679
is uh the inequality and here the factor

1249
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:57,600
is the fundamental relation for which we

1250
01:09:51,679 --> 01:10:00,880
can do as usual uh a series expansion

1251
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,760
around State

1252
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:07,400
one it will have a linear

1253
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:09,120
term and let's keep also the second

1254
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,880
order

1255
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:15,880
ter plus Dots

1256
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,880
Dots

1257
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,159
okay so uh you see this expression it's

1258
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:27,159
S2

1259
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:33,080
S1 but S2 is S1 plus

1260
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:40,440
DS so we can uh uh take the S1 on the

1261
01:10:36,679 --> 01:10:42,960
left hand side here it becomes the S and

1262
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:47,679
uh here is the rewriting so

1263
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,920
DS is equal to d e over t plus the

1264
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,719
second

1265
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:54,159
derivative plus Dots Dots

1266
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,840
Dots what do we know about the second

1267
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:59,560
derivatives

1268
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,960
when we just proved that they are

1269
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,040
negative okay

1270
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:07,560
so if this is a negative number and this

1271
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:11,360
is a squared

1272
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:11,360
number this thing will

1273
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:18,760
subtract therefore this will be less

1274
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,760
than just d e over

1275
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,679
T there is an exception

1276
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:31,440
though if the system is a re were that

1277
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:31,440
second derivative is equal to zero

1278
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:40,400
right uh so here we would have an equal

1279
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:46,400
sign for if a is s were and the same

1280
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:46,400
identical um treatment goes for system

1281
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:57,679
B okay so now we can put these all

1282
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,480
together just uh shuffled things around

1283
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:06,159
up to here it's the same that we've seen

1284
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:06,159
so far now let me combine U those

1285
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:21,400
equations said we have 1 two 3 four five

1286
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:26,360
six we can eliminate four variables and

1287
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,360
the remain two equations

1288
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:35,159
I let you do the algebra it's it's um

1289
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:38,120
it's easy

1290
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:40,239
enough and since I want to concentrate

1291
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:43,840
on the energy and entropy transfers so

1292
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:46,239
the Delta e and the Delta s uh these are

1293
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,920
the variables that I keep eliminate the

1294
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,920
other the other Force

1295
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:57,600
changes so this is for system um for

1296
01:12:54,600 --> 01:13:01,040
system a from the balances from system a

1297
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,040
and this is from system

1298
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:09,239
B they both contain Delta

1299
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:11,840
s so I can combine these two in a single

1300
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:14,480
uh uh train of

1301
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:19,320
inequalities where Delta

1302
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:21,920
s the entropy exchange is at the

1303
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:26,639
center and it's

1304
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:29,199
less than if I add the and to be

1305
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:32,080
produced by reversibility and this must

1306
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:36,199
be less than Delta the energy over

1307
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:39,880
t1b and on the other side side this

1308
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:44,440
is greater than if I subtract something

1309
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:47,120
positive and it is in turn uh greater

1310
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:50,960
than the energy over

1311
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,920
T great all right so this is interesting

1312
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,920
by

1313
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,920
itself because

1314
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,960
it says all right remember we started

1315
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:07,239
from our two systems in two different

1316
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:10,560
temper two different two states sa equum

1317
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:15,239
states with different temperature so T1

1318
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,239
a and t1b are

1319
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,880
different and here we found uh uh we

1320
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:27,159
find a if you forget about if you look

1321
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,400
on only at the Central and the two

1322
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:31,719
extremes of these

1323
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:35,520
inequalities it

1324
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:39,760
says that definitely if you want to have

1325
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:43,280
a finite I mean not a finite but nonzero

1326
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,280
transfer of energy from A to

1327
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:53,159
B uh you

1328
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:53,159
need an entropy change an entropy

1329
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:58,679
transfer with some value that stays

1330
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,480
within this

1331
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:07,320
interval of the energy transfer divided

1332
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:07,320
by uh the two temperatures of the two uh

1333
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,880
systems uh

1334
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,520
okay so let me let me do it

1335
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,360
uh so it says

1336
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:34,679
what is it I could write that

1337
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,679
inequality this

1338
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:48,440
way take things on the left hand

1339
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:48,440
side and uh am I right if I do

1340
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:58,320
this yeah I'm taking

1341
01:15:53,560 --> 01:16:02,639
this all the way to the other side right

1342
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:05,560
okay so what does that tell me if I want

1343
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:07,280
Delta e

1344
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,400
a

1345
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:13,679
positive in other words if I want to

1346
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,679
transfer energy from A to

1347
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,199
B if this is positive that has to be

1348
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:21,440
negative if this has to be

1349
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:24,760
negative uh it means that the second

1350
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:28,280
term must be bigger than the first one

1351
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:30,920
okay okay uh so that means that the

1352
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,960
denominator must be

1353
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,960
smaller so that

1354
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,960
implies t uh 1

1355
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:43,120
a greater than

1356
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:46,600
t1b is that what we expected

1357
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:50,679
yeah we can transfer

1358
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:53,320
energies only in the direction from the

1359
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:56,360
hot to the

1360
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:59,080
cold that's close your statement of the

1361
01:16:56,360 --> 01:17:01,400
second law of course if you want this

1362
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,840
negative it can do it only in the

1363
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,840
opposite

1364
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:15,120
situation

1365
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:18,320
next and all right so that's uh so by

1366
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:22,639
looking at the two end

1367
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:25,199
parts you uh we proved that was a

1368
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:29,719
statement of the second law that uh uh

1369
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:32,560
energy cannot uh uh flow spontaneously

1370
01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:36,239
and spontaneously is well while there

1371
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:39,960
are no other external effects you're

1372
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:42,800
considering a system in which this is a

1373
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:49,080
composite A and B is

1374
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:51,560
isolated so uh only can only occur from

1375
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,560
hot to cold high temperature to low

1376
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,560
temperature

1377
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
if there is a

1378
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:03,639
finite if the two systems initially are

1379
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,639
at different

1380
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:14,360
temperatures it says that the there must

1381
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:14,360
be also an eltropy transfer between the

1382
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:22,880
two and this entropy transfer must be

1383
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:22,880
contained between these two

1384
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,440
extremes it doesn't have have to have a

1385
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:31,679
specific value as long as it is within

1386
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,679
that

1387
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:40,239
interval and

1388
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:43,679
clearly if the

1389
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:43,679
temperatures are

1390
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:51,679
positive as they are for the most

1391
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,440
systems uh that entropy transfer occurs

1392
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,320
in the same direction as the energy

1393
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:59,120
transfer

1394
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:03,080
so the sign of Delta

1395
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:05,400
S I mean if this is positive temperature

1396
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,159
is positive so this is a positive number

1397
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:10,679
and Delta s must be greater than a

1398
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:10,679
positive number so it's positive

1399
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:19,159
two I need also to transfer entropy

1400
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:19,159
which is also uh the geometrical idea

1401
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:33,840
here yeah D NM all what do it 2 a 3 y

1402
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:38,520
z yes yeah let's discuss

1403
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,520
that um this is just a way to identify

1404
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:44,840
the inequalities because I'm interested

1405
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:48,920
also in when are the strict equalities

1406
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,920
valid in these various

1407
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:55,320
situations and uh so I kept the trace of

1408
01:19:53,400 --> 01:20:00,440
where they came from

1409
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:03,760
for example one a comes from here

1410
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:07,320
if system a under go a reversible

1411
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:12,280
process so that the uh there's no

1412
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:16,360
entropy produced in a this becomes a

1413
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:19,600
strict equality okay and you and so this

1414
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:23,120
becomes here's one a so this becomes a

1415
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:27,080
strict equality when this is

1416
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:31,600
zero that Al so for system

1417
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:34,639
B then we have uh uh like 3 a oh no I'm

1418
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:38,760
sorry 2 a is

1419
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:40,760
here when is the uh strict quality

1420
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,120
valid

1421
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:47,280
okay remember there is is where we did

1422
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,280
the taor series

1423
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:54,159
expansion so if we if we remain on the

1424
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:58,440
curve for the stable equilibrium stat so

1425
01:20:54,159 --> 01:21:02,320
if state two of system a uh is stable

1426
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:05,040
equilibrium uh we have strict equality

1427
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:10,280
because we are in the maximum entropy uh

1428
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:14,480
State here if you instead go somewhere

1429
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:17,040
inside uh then you have an inequality a

1430
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,000
strict inequality so in other words that

1431
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,840
inequality measures how distance you are

1432
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,840
from

1433
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:26,440
equilibrium

1434
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:32,199
okay so that means that if system a ends

1435
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:37,320
up in stable equilibrium State you have

1436
01:21:32,199 --> 01:21:42,560
the equality here in 2 a them for

1437
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:42,560
2B ah 3 a and

1438
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:49,920
3B are

1439
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:52,040
um okay when do I have equality there we

1440
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:55,000
said it if we have a

1441
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:58,000
reservoir if we have a reservoir the

1442
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,199
second derivatives are zero and

1443
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:07,239
therefore this is equal uh so in order

1444
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:13,320
for the DS a to be strictly

1445
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:16,560
equal to D EA over T1 I need both these

1446
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:19,320
inequalities to be strict equalities so

1447
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:24,800
I need system a to end in a stable equum

1448
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:27,560
State and system a to be a resir

1449
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,560
even for

1450
01:22:29,639 --> 01:22:34,960
me

1451
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:36,120
now it's clear also that since these two

1452
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,719
extreme

1453
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:41,560
values are different if I start from

1454
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:44,600
different

1455
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:48,760
temperatures okay it's

1456
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:52,120
impossible that all the strict

1457
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:55,520
inequalities equalities apply at once

1458
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:59,199
otherwise I would have a situ in which

1459
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,199
one number is different from a different

1460
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:08,080
number okay but for example suppose

1461
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,639
system a is a

1462
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,320
reservoir and suppose it does end in a

1463
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,920
stable equilibrium

1464
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,280
State and suppose that there is no

1465
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:22,280
entropy produced by reversibility within

1466
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:24,639
a okay that is enough for this strict

1467
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:27,440
equality to apply and that strict equ

1468
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:30,840
quality to apply so that means that the

1469
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:34,040
amount of entropy that is uh uh

1470
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:37,040
extracted from a is equal to the amount

1471
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:39,679
of energy extracted divided by the

1472
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,679
temperature of

1473
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:48,760
a and

1474
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:51,400
that's we're converging to the idea of a

1475
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:55,480
heat interaction because that will be a

1476
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:59,040
heat interaction when the ratio of the

1477
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:00,760
energy to the entropy exchanged is equal

1478
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:04,639
to the

1479
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:08,600
uh the temperature of the system that

1480
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,600
gives the end the and the

1481
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:18,360
energy okay but so if if a is a resir

1482
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:23,360
and ends up in an an equilibrium

1483
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:24,840
State then suppose then either this one

1484
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,600
or the other one

1485
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:32,280
must not be uh strict equal cannot be

1486
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:36,000
strict equality so uh either if system

1487
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:39,080
B if you insist that system B also ends

1488
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,760
in a stable equilibrium State and maybe

1489
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:44,280
it's also a reservoir so now we have

1490
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,280
having two

1491
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:51,760
reservoirs uh it means so this one is

1492
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:54,719
equal so it means that this one cannot

1493
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,320
be equal and therefore it means that you

1494
01:24:54,719 --> 01:25:01,880
have you need to generate some

1495
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:01,880
entropy by reversibility in system

1496
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:10,080
B which we can

1497
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,080
uh we can

1498
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,880
uh we can picture this

1499
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:24,600
way oh no

1500
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:26,600
sorry I said worse

1501
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:30,040
we do it

1502
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,040
here system

1503
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:34,600
a system

1504
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:42,239
B okay it just say A and B and you know

1505
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,800
what we mean energy versus

1506
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:48,800
Center so if I extract

1507
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,800
energy

1508
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:56,239
uh from

1509
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:56,239
a it ends up in a stable

1510
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:03,960
State and no

1511
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:06,159
entropy production by irreversibility

1512
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:10,280
here now system

1513
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:10,280
B must take that same

1514
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:17,280
energy so somehow I should take a

1515
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,280
segment this

1516
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:26,239
much uh it receives an entropy which is

1517
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,239
equal to this

1518
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,320
so it

1519
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:36,600
goes

1520
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:39,880
here so the effect of the interaction

1521
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,280
with a is to transfer this much energy

1522
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:45,880
and this much

1523
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:48,560
entropy to b b ends up in a non-e

1524
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:52,360
equilibrium State and if you want it to

1525
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:56,239
go to an equilibrium state it needs to

1526
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,239
generate this entropy by reverse

1527
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,159
possibility all right so this is a

1528
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,760
complicated picture that

1529
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:18,000
I it's another couple of days of uh uh

1530
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:18,000
playing with um PowerPoint but

1531
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:26,119
um it does uh

1532
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:33,639
provide a geometrical explanation of

1533
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:38,400
this uh train of

1534
01:27:33,639 --> 01:27:39,840
inequalities essentially showing that um

1535
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,679
the

1536
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:46,040
entropy

1537
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:48,639
change or actually the entropy

1538
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:51,119
transferred is between a minimum and a

1539
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:54,600
maximum value that is

1540
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,920
uh related to the slopes the local

1541
01:27:54,600 --> 01:28:00,880
slopes of the table stable equilibrium

1542
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:00,880
states of the two systems A and

1543
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:08,520
B and I think there is also an even more

1544
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,520
complicated

1545
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:16,239
one you

1546
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:16,239
see

1547
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,840
um clus uh

1548
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:29,920
statement we proved it for incin

1549
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:29,920
decimal um amounts of energy

1550
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:36,840
transfer but what about you want to

1551
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:39,840
extract a finite amount of

1552
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,840
energy

1553
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:48,560
okay well finite amount of

1554
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:51,440
energy uh it is U

1555
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:55,920
again we

1556
01:28:51,440 --> 01:29:00,280
cannot reason this way I'm starting from

1557
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:03,760
system a in state A1 and I want to

1558
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:03,760
extract this much

1559
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:11,040
energy so as I said it could

1560
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:11,040
go in any of these

1561
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:16,639
states system B starts from

1562
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:22,080
here it receives that

1563
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:28,239
energy and and in principle it can go in

1564
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:31,239
any of these

1565
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:31,239
states

1566
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:37,920
okay so that means that if you give to

1567
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:42,239
be this much energy it is able to

1568
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:43,760
accommodate only this much entropy it

1569
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,119
cannot go to the right to the right

1570
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,080
because there are no states there so

1571
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:48,960
this is the

1572
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:52,560
max the maximum amount of entropy that

1573
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:55,880
we can accommodate and

1574
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:59,239
therefore that's the maximum amount of

1575
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:02,000
entropy that a can

1576
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:07,840
decrease so that means that

1577
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:10,320
somehow uh uh a can only go uh down to

1578
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,880
here and that is

1579
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:17,520
uh the meaning of this construction so

1580
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:21,080
uh there is a limited range of possible

1581
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:24,080
values and here is the is the analytic

1582
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,080
expression

1583
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:32,360
for the Claus inequality let's call it

1584
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,360
Claus inequality for um

1585
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:38,440
for

1586
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:42,239
yeah uh

1587
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:42,239
okay yeah we have 5

1588
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:50,920
minutes I think it's enough oops I know

1589
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:53,360
next yeah sorry I decided I I decided

1590
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:55,840
that I couldn't get this far but so I

1591
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:59,119
don't have VI graphs anymore so next

1592
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:03,800
time we'll do work and uh and heat but

1593
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:06,440
let me anticipate the idea first of all

1594
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:10,360
we Define

1595
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:14,040
work as an interaction in which there is

1596
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:14,040
no entropy

1597
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:21,639
transfer see that we we shifted the the

1598
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,440
order of of of typical presentation

1599
01:31:21,639 --> 01:31:25,440
usually in fine

1600
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:31,600
uh see here we are using entropy to

1601
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,600
Define

1602
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,119
work and um the

1603
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:44,199
other anything that transfers entropy is

1604
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,199
a non-w work

1605
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:51,080
interaction and if

1606
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:55,880
uh if there is an entropy

1607
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:58,719
transfer is not necessarily always heat

1608
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:00,080
we're going to call heat a very special

1609
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,480
limiting

1610
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:06,320
situation essentially that limiting

1611
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:10,040
situation that is captured by this train

1612
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,040
of inequalities

1613
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:19,239
here when you squeeze the

1614
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:20,719
interval in which the entropy transfer

1615
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:23,600
values are

1616
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:27,040
confined and you squeeze that interval

1617
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,920
it becomes just a single

1618
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:33,199
possibility how do you squeeze that

1619
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:37,159
interval by having the two systems begin

1620
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:38,880
at close temperatures close and close or

1621
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:41,480
actually in the limit in which the two

1622
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:46,760
systems have the same

1623
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:50,000
temperature the the entropy transfer as

1624
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:53,000
a precise value it doesn't have any more

1625
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,920
in range just a precise single value

1626
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,080
which is equal to to the energy

1627
01:32:54,920 --> 01:33:00,560
transferred divided by the temperature

1628
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:04,119
of the two systems that's we call it

1629
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:07,280
heat and that's so energy we will call

1630
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:10,600
it Q so Q over

1631
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:12,119
T so the entropy transfer will be the

1632
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:15,960
heat over the

1633
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:19,320
temperature which I'm sure is uh the way

1634
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:22,440
you have seen

1635
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:25,760
uh probably the definition of entropy in

1636
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,760
previous uh courses

1637
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:35,480
okay so yeah I think we can stop uh here

1638
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,480
for today
