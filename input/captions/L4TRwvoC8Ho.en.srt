1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,080
Um, hi. Can you hear me? Great. Thanks.

2
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,960
It's um, it's a pleasure to be here with

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,240
you all this morning and with Zayb who I

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,679
have known now for I don't know 10 years

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,399
or something like that. three mothers

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,480
out front. Um, so I want to talk to you

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
today about something that's maybe a

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,440
little bit different from what others

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,680
will be talking to you about over the

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,399
course of the day. Uh, and that is

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
power. Not the kind of power that you

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,440
spent a lot of the day talking about and

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
we'll be talking more about this

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,960
afternoon, but people power.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,600
Um, and I want to encourage you to think

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
about climate change as a ultimately a

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
problem of political power. So when we

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,280
take a step back and we think about why

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,080
it is that after decades and decades of

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,479
science and consensus in the scientific

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,960
community that we are indeed heating the

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,920
earth and with catastrophic implications

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
for life on this planet as we know it

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,720
have to think about what it is that is

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,880
preventing us from making more progress.

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,880
And we need to think about the powers on

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,600
the left hand side of the scale which

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,280
represent the fossil fuel industry, the

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,880
prochemical industry, uh the banks and

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,759
investors that make money from the

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,759
industry, the politicians that are being

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
heavily influenced by the industry. I

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
think the oil and gas industry spent

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
$230

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,479
million or so getting Trump elected,

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,960
probably more than that. Um and then of

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,799
course just status quo like people are

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,840
kind of resistant to change in general

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,360
and we have an entire economy based on

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,280
uh that's built on uh fossil fuels. Um

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,320
so the question is what do we do about

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,280
that? And what we do at mothers outfront

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,560
is we talk about building power and we

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,759
engage in the process of building power.

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,560
So ultimately it's the question is how

46
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,599
do we drive transformational change of

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,200
the level that we need in order to shift

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,560
the scale so we can actually win

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,280
campaigns and uh create the conditions

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,599
for network geothermal and other

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,040
important technologies to come in etc

52
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,160
etc and to do so in an equitable manner.

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,239
So, as it turns out, transformational

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,319
change throughout American history and

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,800
around the world has really largely been

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,080
possible because of social movements.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,160
So, it's large large numbers of people

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,280
coming together out of a sense of shared

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,400
values and a sense of outrage at the

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,200
disconnect between the world they people

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
want and the world as it is and people

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
coming together, learning how to

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,319
organize together and drive campaigns

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,239
for change. So that has been the case

65
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,239
whether it's the civil rights movement,

66
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,640
women's rights, abolitionism before

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,040
that, LGBTQ rights, the early

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,000
environmental movement, and we're seeing

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,159
bits of it and not enough of it yet with

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
sort of the what you see of the climate

71
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,080
movement across the country. So how does

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,680
this relate to Mothers Outfront? Um I'll

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
tell you a little bit about my story

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,959
which is uh I am the mother of two

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,879
daughters and when they were quite young

76
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,280
I had one of those moments of absolute

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,799
despair uh looking at the climate crisis

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,200
through the lens of the for the first

79
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
time of being a mom and thinking about

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,840
the kind of world that my children would

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,000
be growing up in and thinking well that

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,519
I can't not try to do something about

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,920
this but I don't know if I can go back.

84
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
Yeah, but I was the little person on the

85
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,879
right hand side of the scale. I was one

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,239
person, a mom, not a scientist, not an

87
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,080
elected official, not a policy expert,

88
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,640
wondering what could I possibly do to

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,280
affect this enormous overwhelming set of

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,879
challenges. And around that time, I had

91
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,519
the opportunity to meet a man by the

92
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,200
name of Marshall Gans, who teaches

93
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,239
organizing at the Harvard Kennedy

94
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,160
School. And I called him up and I said,

95
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,000
"Will you please meet with me?" And he

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,520
graciously said, "Yes." He had no idea

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
who I was. And in about half an hour of

98
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
meeting Marshall, he explained to me the

99
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,800
power of social movement building, its

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
role in American history. And

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,800
importantly, that organizing to build

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,280
social movements is a practice that

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,759
anybody can learn. Any one of you can

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,240
become an organizer.

105
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,400
And so I teamed up with a couple of moms

106
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
and we started getting together with

107
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
other moms. We invited we had one-on-one

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,759
meetings. We invited them to house

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,919
parties and we started forming teams of

110
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
moms and providing a structure that

111
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,080
allowed them to come together, think

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
about what they wanted to work on

113
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,039
together and start implementing

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,280
campaigns.

115
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,320
So we were starting to build the right

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,840
hand side of the scale and Zanb and Ania

117
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
who was supposed to be moderating the

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,800
session and unfortunately had to leave

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,960
um were both integral parts of the early

120
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,960
days of Mothers Outfront as was Nathan

121
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Phillips.

122
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:33,199
So we started organizing about 12 years

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,160
ago and our downtown Boston team led by

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,560
Aniia among others

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
was trying to figure out what it is that

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
they wanted to work on for their

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,960
campaign. And lo and behold, this

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
article comes out in the Boston Globe

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,080
about a study that Nathan Phillips was

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,880
involved in um indicating the role of

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,360
gas leaks in killing trees and

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,600
highlighting the number of gas leaks all

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,400
across the Boston area. And it was

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,520
shocking. And that is when our downtown

135
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,520
Boston team of moms said, "Aha, this is

136
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
what we want to work on. It's a concrete

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,160
thing. It's killing trees up and down

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,720
the blocks in our neighborhood. We want

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,720
to take this on.

140
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:23,199
And amazingly, this little organization

141
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,360
called HEAT had created maps show they

142
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,919
had taken the data available publicly

143
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,520
available information, input it into

144
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,680
spreadsheets and created maps of of of

145
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,360
different neighborhoods across Boston

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,919
showing just how many leaks there were.

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,160
This is a perfect organizing tool

148
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,160
because it allowed us at Mothers

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,960
Outfront to take something that was

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,960
invisible to everybody and make it

151
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
visible.

152
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,600
And so what happened next was that Ania

153
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,440
and others took it upon themselves to go

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,360
out and reach out to other Mothers

155
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,199
Outfront teams that we had formed across

156
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:08,080
the state by then. and they

157
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:10,800
all 16 of our teams got involved

158
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,280
and Aniia and others made presentations

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
saying you need to know about gas leaks.

160
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,479
This is why they're bad. Yes, they're

161
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,680
killing trees. They're also bad for our

162
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,039
health and they're major drivers of

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,319
climate change. And that was the process

164
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,199
of engaging the other teams that we had

165
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,120
done the work of creating all across the

166
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,120
state of Massachusetts

167
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,240
in this fight against the gas leaks.

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,840
So, this was um this was a very cold

169
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,680
January day when a bunch of us got

170
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,680
together under Ania's direction and

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,960
equipped with the maps of where the gas

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,840
leaks were. We fanned out across Boston

173
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,120
and we tagged, physically tagged every

174
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,000
gas leak in the city. And this exercise

175
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,240
of physically tagging gas leaks was

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,440
repeated in communities across the

177
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,400
Boston area, thereby again making the

178
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,400
invisible visible. And people for the

179
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,759
first time were making this connection

180
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,680
between gas leaks killing my trees that

181
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,879
I sort of know about because I smell

182
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
them when I walk around and and where

183
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,280
they're located and what we can actually

184
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,240
do about it. So, we called attention on

185
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,240
all the tags to the responsible company

186
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
and all the gas companies started

187
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,560
getting harassed by lots of people very

188
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,039
upset that there were these gas leaks

189
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,719
all over the place. So, the people in

190
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
orange, in case you're wondering,

191
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
they're supposed to be gas leaks

192
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,719
themselves. So, anyway, we had a little

193
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,480
fun with it, too.

194
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,480
So there we are tagging gas leaks

195
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,240
and in the process during while we were

196
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,240
also tagging gas leaks it was part of a

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,560
broader campaign. It wasn't just about

198
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,800
tagging gas leaks. It was a whole

199
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,720
strategy. So we met with elected

200
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
officials in various towns and cities

201
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,640
across the state.

202
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,480
We rallied rallied in front of the state

203
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,880
house. We rallied in front of what's

204
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,560
that? That's I think the Cambridge um

205
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Cambridge state house.

206
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,839
We spoke up and we testified. We

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,560
testified at city city city meetings in

208
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
the city of Boston. Um you can see Zanab

209
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
there. That's a knee on the far left who

210
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,959
was supposed to be here. Nathan Phillips

211
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,600
joined us for a lot of these activities

212
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,680
and we collaborated. We teamed up with I

213
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,080
mean we never work alone because you

214
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,880
cannot achieve your goals as a

215
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,880
relatively small organization. So we

216
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
knew we needed allies. Of course, we had

217
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,440
heat working with us because we used

218
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,320
their maps. You can see Nathan Phillips

219
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
down here. And we created we brought in

220
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
as many allies as we possibly could and

221
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,320
in the process even created a whole new

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,600
organization that then was called the

223
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,959
Gas Leaks Allies and is now called the

224
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,959
Gas Transition Allies. Um and that is a

225
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
group of organizations that continues to

226
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,040
meet on a regular basis to talk about

227
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,519
how we drive important policy forward in

228
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,120
the state.

229
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,560
We also sought out unlikely partners and

230
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:23,440
this is where geothermal networks come

231
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:27,120
in. So Zanb was part of and the arrow is

232
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
pointing to um what was her name? Mary

233
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,320
>> Marcy.

234
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,920
>> Marcy Reid, thank you. who was then um

235
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,320
the president of National Grid in

236
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,680
Massachusetts. And um this is actually a

237
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,279
funny story. So Marcy was refusing to

238
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,880
meet with us. And we all were tweeting

239
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,680
with her the day that we were tagging

240
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,440
gas leaks across the city of Boston. And

241
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,120
by the end of the day, she's like,

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
"Okay, okay, okay. I'm going to meet,

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,600
you know, I'll meet with you." Um so it

244
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,600
was very effective. But when we went in

245
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,519
to meet with the CEO of Eversource, it

246
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,240
was Zanb and a few others from Mothers

247
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,320
Outfront and I think Audrey from HEAT.

248
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,959
And they went in and they sat down with

249
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,600
Bill Aley who was asked before the

250
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,600
meeting if he thought he needed security

251
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
because he was they were so accustomed

252
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,120
to the company coming under sort of

253
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
pressure from advocacy groups. And he

254
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
said, "No, I don't think I need

255
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,040
security. It's a group of moms." and he

256
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,279
sat down with a group of moms and Zayan

257
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,600
and the others in the room started by

258
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,079
talking about why they were there which

259
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,240
was for their children and Zay said I

260
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,839
have three children these are their ages

261
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,760
this is why I'm here I'm worried for

262
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,120
their future

263
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,079
and Aley sort of paused and he said oh

264
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
well I have three children too and they

265
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
they form this connection around their

266
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
shared concern about their children he

267
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,399
said of course I'm concerned for my

268
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,880
children too and it it it created an

269
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,680
opening and an opportunity for

270
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,760
collaboration and that was the beginning

271
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,920
of the reason why you're all here today

272
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,079
to learn about geothermal networks. So

273
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,399
I think the lesson in all of this is

274
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:13,040
that building power is absolutely

275
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,959
essential for creating the conditions we

276
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,760
need for the level of transformational

277
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,920
change we need to create the future that

278
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,079
we all want for our children and our

279
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,959
grandchildren and future generations.

280
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,639
Uh, and I think every time you think

281
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,360
about the climate crisis, I would always

282
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,560
I would encourage you to always think

283
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,800
about where does building power fit into

284
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,800
my thinking here because it's a

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
critically important piece and we all

286
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,920
have to be thinking about it and

287
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,720
hopefully be part of building that power

288
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,200
and implementing that power. So, thank

289
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,200
you very much.
