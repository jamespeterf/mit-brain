Good morning. I'm really um happy to be

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,280
here on this side of the boot camp. I uh

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,799
was I think in the second MIT boot camp,

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,479
entrepreneur boot camp uh cohort um and

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,159
it was an intense experience. It wasn't

20
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,799
healthcare specific um but it was very

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,240
um formative for me and began my journey

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,200
as an entrepreneur. Uh I'm going to tell

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,560
you my story and the story of my

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,880
company. uh throughout this session. So,

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
um I'm gonna not do a formal

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,079
introduction right now um at this

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,759
moment, but um I want to first say hello

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,439
to everybody I got to meet in the

29
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,240

you. Shout out.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,040
And I'm going to just start out by

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,200
throwing out a question because I think

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,439
this is it's important to kind of root

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,759
ourselves in what my um intention was in

36
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,320
transitioning, you know, or or just

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
embarking on the work that that I do.

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,000
And so, uh, I'm just going to ask any,

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:06,240
you know, anybody here ever have the

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,280

for you to try to embark on something

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,480
new like a behavior change?

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,599
Well, in the beginning you

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,680
it's always hard and it's hard to keep

58
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,040
up like with the habit especially when

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,200
you're trying to read something about

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,200
your dig

61
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,120
able to

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
Yeah.

63
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,879
Yeah, I I saw somebody put lifech

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,959
changing

65
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,959
um which means that it was probably um

66
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,959
your

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,760
All right, we'll come back to you.

68
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,799
Anybody else have a a a one-word um

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,239
story for for a lifestyle change?

70
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,400
Painful. I see painful.

71
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,480
I mean, in general, right, it's hard

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,080
work and full of ups and downs, right?

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,000
Um, and you know, it's hard to, you

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
know, is and and for those of us who are

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,120
in pretty good health, I mean, that that

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
can feel just like a um, you know, a

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,159
thing that maybe we we keep coming back

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,400
to and trying, it's it's, you know, it

79
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,799
become it raises its level of importance

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,879
when it becomes a matter of life and

81
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,040
death. um or or even harder if it

82
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
becomes a matter of consequence but

83
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,680
you're not really feeling any of the

84
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,160
negative consequences um in the in in

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,800
the moment of opportunity to make a

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,600
difference in your future health. I

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,280
would add the additional complication or

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,280
complexity that when you are not able to

89
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,080
meet your basic needs in life or if you

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,520
have a complex comorbidity like mental

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,600
health or other issues you know getting

92
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,639
it together is really difficult and you

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,400
know in in my experience taking care of

94
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,880
people and and working with people in

95
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,400
that situation I it was both difficult

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,360
as a clinician to feel unsuccessful, not

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,160
able to provide people with the kind of

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,199
support that they needed uh and to watch

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,600
people face the consequences. And so my

100
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,479
story is really about how I was trying

101
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,560
to help myself while also trying to help

102
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,000
my patients because I was starting to

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,080
feel burned out uh by the lack of

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
progress that I was making with people.

105
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,600
Um and and I just felt like I couldn't

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,880
have another conversation about quitting

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,320
smoking without better tools. And so I

108
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,800
started to but out of the my own drive

109
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,639
to try to make um my patients

110
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,960
better serve my patients trying to find

111
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,759
better ways to deliver health care. I

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,560
also have a personal story with um my

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,360
husband who experienced um a very

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,720
serious brush with cancer and thankfully

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,160
I had a very good outcome but a a very

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,440
ex difficult experience. Um and those

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,000
kind of um those experiences informed my

118
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
journey from uh being a primary care

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,039
doctor to a paliative care doctor,

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
health services researcher to ultimately

121
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,280
what I spend most of my my time doing

122
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,919
today which is trying to deliver better

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,080
health care um through uh as an

124
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,560
entrepreneur. So I'm going to try to use

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,840
some slides to tell my story but I

126
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
really would like this to be

127
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,080
interactive. So, please, if you have

128
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,120

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,919
I can see my slides, but I cannot see

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,639

138
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,919

139
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,759
can't? No. Okay, let me try this again.

140
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,479
I'm going to try to do it so that I can

141
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:02,199

142
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,199

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,639
Hang on a sec.

145
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,440

147
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,120

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,280
Okay,

here we go. Share.

150
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,800
All right. And then

151
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
slideshow.

152
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,360
We can see them right away. How's that?

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
Now I can see you and I can see my size.

154
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,319
Sorry about that. All right. So, we're

155
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,639
gonna talk today about translating

156
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,000
health services research into healthcare

157
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,479
entrepreneurship. And you know in my

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,360
experience as a researcher most of the

159
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,400
time uh research questions or people

160
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,199
pursue research questions um or pathways

161
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,000
that really have something to do with uh

162
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:21,759
their own passion or or curiosity. So my

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,479
story began began that way as well. So I

164
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,720
um I'll tell you I started out I'm from

165
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,440
the area here. I grew up in Arlington,

166
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,039
Massachusetts. I went to Bentley College

167
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,240
to study business. And um after spending

168
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,640
a couple of years working for a a think

169
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,240
tank uh that was working on the internet

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,000
for the military, I made the decision to

171
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,880
uh go to medical school and I changed

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,480
gears, went to Wake Forest University

173
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,959
Medical School in North Carolina. And uh

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,440
from Wake Forest, I uh went to

175
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,600
California to um study family medicine

176
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
at Adventist Health primarily because I

177
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,959
thought, "Oh, I'm going to go in the

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,680
Peace Corps and I want to deliver a lot

179
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,320
of babies and take care of people from

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
cradle to grave and learn Spanish." And

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,640
so I ended up in California for 10

182
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,920
years. And um in East Los Angeles where

183
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,839
my practice was, I was experiencing a

184
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,320
lot of um difficulties delivering care

185
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,040
to my patients. And I couldn't figure

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,120
out I didn't understand why it was so

187
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,000
difficult to get services for my

188
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,040
patients at that time and why they were

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,320
experiencing poor health outcomes. Um

190
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,279
and so I kind of embarked on a on a

191
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
journey um through epidemiology. I

192
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,519
wanted to build up my skills to

193
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,839
understand and and study what I was

194
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,000
seeing in my practice. And so I got a

195
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,640
master's in clinical research at UCLA

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,399
and I started studying childhood obesity

197
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,120
of all things because at the time I did

198
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,560
a lot of maternal child health and I

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,800
just started to see ch very very young

200
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,040
children, infants, toddlers,

201
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,920
preschoolers with obesity and it was the

202
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
very beginning of the um obesity

203
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,320
epidemic in childhood. And when I went

204
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,040
to the library to get the answers where

205
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,560
I always went to get answers, there was

206
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,519
no literature about obesity in children

207
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,240
at that age level. And I started going

208
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,320
and looking for people who were experts

209
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,240
in the area and they would tell me, "Oh,

210
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,120
they're just chubby babies. They grow

211
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,839
out of it." And you know, fast forward

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,760
20 years later, we know that children um

213
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
there is an epidemic in very young

214
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,399
children and even in infants and

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,720
toddlers of being overweight and that

216
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,680
those con those have consequences uh

217
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,800
lifelong consequences. But at the time

218
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,279
um I was just starting to understand how

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,880
to translate what I was seeing in my

220
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,839
practice in a population level way. And

221
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,959
that became kind of a fascination for me

222
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,000
because I was talking to patients and

223
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,720
they were telling me how um you know

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
difficult it was to manage their child's

225
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,079
diet and I thought that daycare programs

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,640
were the problem and I went and talked

227
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,279
to a woman who studied uh early

228
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,120
childhood education and she re basically

229
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
laughed me out of the room and told me I

230
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,800
had it all wrong and that it was

231
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,720
actually structured daycare that was

232
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,760
helping children stay healthy.

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,760
And I started to realize that um there

234
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,640
was a there was a process to

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,320
understanding one how to translate a

236
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,839
question that I was experiencing in

237
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,079
clinic into a researchable question that

238
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,760
would then turn into a solution because

239
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,160
what I didn't want was to just

240
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,880
understand a problem. I wanted to find a

241
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,600
solution. And that is really the story

242
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,000
of my journey from becoming a researcher

243
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,079
to um going into um entrepreneurship. I

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,640
ended up coming back to Massachusetts

245
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,240
and I joined the faculty at Boston

246
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,120
University at Boston Medical Center

247
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,279
where I was for 16 years doing um health

248
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,399
services research and that was really a

249
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,399
formative experience because my very

250
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,279
first research project was called

251
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,639
project red the re-engineered discharge

252
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,120
and it went viral while I was on that

253
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,160
study. It was one of three studies that

254
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,000
came out at the same time that the

255
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,120
federal government started issuing

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,639
penalties for hospital readmissions. And

257
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,920
so immediately there was an unbelievable

258
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,000
demand for Project Red implementation.

259
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,240
And I became an implementation

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,880
specialist without really even planning

261
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,519
to because there was such a demand for

262
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,480
an evidence-based solution to avoid

263
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,800
penalties. And so my experience told me

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
that good research should go out into

265
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,480
the world and make a difference. Today,

266
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,000
Project Red is one of the top 50

267
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,800
research studies um ever disseminated um

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,360
around the world really. And so that was

269
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,720
my first in you know insight about

270
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,880
research and um it really informed my

271
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
next in important study which I'm going

272
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,920
to share with you called women in

273
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,279
control. So designing research that

274
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,519
solves a real problem with potential

275
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,560
real solutions. That was what I really

276
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,240
wanted to do. So when you do research,

277
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,399
I'm sure some of you out there are

278
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,079
researchers and know how this process

279
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,160
works. You know, you have to start with

280
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
a researchable question. And for

281
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,680
clinicians, a lot of times, you know,

282
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,360
you understand the problem, but you

283
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
don't know how to formulate it into a

284
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,839
researchable question so that you can

285
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,040
develop evidence around it. And what's

286
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,320
been very interesting for me in going,

287
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,040
you know, going from a research

288
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,519
environment to a a entrepreneur

289
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,240
environment is the what I think of as an

290
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,480
artificial line between what is rigorous

291
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,600
research evidence and what's considered

292
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,000
real world evidence. And I would love to

293
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,920
have a conversation about that uh while

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,720
we are here today, which is you know to

295
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,000
me evidence is evidence. It's got to be

296
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,399
rigorously gathered, interpreted, and

297
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,959
and um and uh and analyzed in order to

298
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,800
be in informative. And the the the what

299
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,440
I think of as an artificial distinction

300
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,000
between research um and real world

301
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,399
evidence um is something that I

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,360
encountered in my life in my in my

303
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,920
journey from research to um

304
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,160
entrepreneurship. So the research

305
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,480
question what happened was I started

306
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,680
working on project red and we started

307
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,600
working on um chatbot systems now called

308
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,320
embodied conversational agents and uh to

309
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,040
fill the role of educating people at the

310
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,440
point of hospital discharge. And that

311
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,399
introduced me to this com human computer

312
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:02,399
interaction that is a um com that is was

313
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,000
um a a device a human uh character

314
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,199
teaching people their discharge

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,959
education. Um and from there I started

316
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,680
to study technology to fill gaps in

317
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,639
healthc care services. And in that

318
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,360
process I was introduced to immersive

319
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,399
technology a virtual world gaming uh

320
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,600
systems and we wanted to see if we could

321
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:30,240
use that system to um address gaps in

322
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,839
care delivery uh models that were

323
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,199
unscalable but effective. So that led to

324
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,480
my work called women in control. So the

325
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,880
women in control study was designed to

326
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,560
look at a model of care called group

327
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,399
based medical care visits and whether we

328
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,800
could make those that model of care

329
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,399
scalable with the use of technology. Now

330
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,079
you have to put yourself in the mindset

331
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,880
of you know pre- pandemic like 2010

332
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,199
before technology was really as

333
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,079
ubiquitous as it is today or even in the

334
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:08,160
five years following. So um we were

335
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,480
really looking at using really um you

336
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,639
know innovative but really unfamiliar

337
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
technology in a group of patients that

338
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,600
were facing significant barriers to

339
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,560
health care but also had digital

340
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,160
barriers to you know to accessing health

341
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
care as well. So they weren't familiar

342
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,320
with technology and they didn't have

343
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,560
good access to care and as a result had

344
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,320
poor health outcomes.

345
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,040
Does anybody have any questions or

346
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,600
comments up until this point about the

347
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,600
research process?

348
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,720
Any comments?

349
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,040
Anybody here familiar with research?

350
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,560
Just so I know who my audience is. I

351
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,519
don't want to over uh over share my

352
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,040
research um expertise here, but I'll

353
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,959
keep going. Okay. So um so we did this

354
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,639
study called women in control. We wanted

355
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:06,480
to look at diabetes. We were looking at

356
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,199
an important medical condition that had

357
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,240
been studied up to that moment a model

358
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,880
of care for chronic disease management

359
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,600
that uh was effective

360
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,079
was a population level solution but was

361
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,240
unscalable in its uh implementation in

362
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,799
real world settings. So in in-person

363
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,480
settings and so that study was called

364
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,760
women in control and our our question

365
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,760
let me just minimize this here. So we

366
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,320
what did the evidence show us? The

367
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,559
evidence showed us that um and and in

368
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,960
research generally when you're

369
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,960
developing a research question like in

370
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,919
entrepreneurship you do your customer

371
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,520
discovery process. In in research, we

372
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
usually look at what is the evidence

373
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,400
already available to answer this

374
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,480
question. Um and and what are the gaps

375
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,679
and then the research should address the

376
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,760
gaps. And so what the evidence showed us

377
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,679
was that there was poor access to

378
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,559
effective chronic disease management

379
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,480
among uh underserved populations that

380
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,200
were leading to poor health outcomes and

381
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
health disparities. There was a model of

382
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
care with a lot of evidence called

383
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
medical group visits where instead of

384
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,840
having one-on-one appointments, people

385
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,080
come together for a 2hour appointment uh

386
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,480
in groups of about 10 with a clinician

387
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,799
and an educator, they get

388
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,679
self-management education to teach them

389
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,720
how to manage the disease. They get peer

390
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,160
support which teaches them strategies

391
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,559
for implementing those care programs in

392
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,960
their home life. They get medical

393
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,039
management counseling and it's a

394
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,280
tremendously satisfying model of care

395
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,400
for patients and clinicians. The problem

396
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,440
is the typical barriers to cost

397
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
effectiveness and efficiency. No shows

398
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
transportation, child care

399
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,679
responsibilities, managing group

400
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,760
infrastructure in primary care settings

401
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,760
and billing issues. So there was here's

402
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,360
a great model of care. It works for

403
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,760
population health, but there's

404
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,880
significant barriers to implementation.

405
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,240
And so we wanted to ask, can technology

406
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,799
make this model of care more scalable

407
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,120
and efficient? So we're asking, can we

408
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,600
offer diabetes group visits in a

409
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,240
technology-based environment that will

410
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,840
increase patient engagement,

411
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,840
increase efficiency and cost

412
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,280
effectiveness, and will it be as

413
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,679
effective as in-person classes or

414
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,760
standard of care, which is one-on-one?

415
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,919
So that's how you create a research

416
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,919
question. It's not that different from

417
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:44,320
how you start thinking about how to

418
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,679
build a a a um product. Uh but usually

419
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,440
with the product, you start with the

420
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
customer interviews. So we're starting

421
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,720
with a a problem that we have, which is

422
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,799
how do we use this medical group visit

423
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,200
model of care in a way that's more

424
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,679
effective and efficient.

425
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,520
And so the women in control study was a

426
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,160
comparative effectiveness study. We had

427
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,080
two active arms. One was usual care

428
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,000
which is in-person group visits and the

429
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,880
other was an immersive world translated

430
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,640
curriculum where the women came together

431
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,440
as avatars went through uh 12 weeks of

432
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
of educational programmings and and

433
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,480
medical management as a cohort and we

434
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,360
looked at whether technology would

435
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,919
deliver results that were as good as in

436
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,520
person. We call that non-inferiority

437
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,679
and that means it doesn't have to be

438
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
better. It just has to be as good

439
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,159
because in-person is good but not

440
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,720
scalable. And so we needed it to be

441
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,200
cost-effective, efficient, and equally

442
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,120
as effective clinically. And so we

443
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,720
looked at physical activity, we looked

444
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,039
at glucose control, and we looked at

445
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,440
engagement. And the most important thing

446
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,159
and the pivotal moment for me thinking

447
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,640
like an implementation specialist was

448
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,640
engagement. So, if you don't know

449
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,880
anything about lifestyle uh products,

450
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,559
research that looks at lifestyle change

451
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,200
and lifestyle management usually has

452
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:11,679
extremely high dropout rates. We had 77%

453
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
of our participants complete our

454
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,840
program, our study, which is

455
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,640
exceptional. It's very exceptional to

456
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,000
have that many people stick with the

457
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,000
program. And for me that was uh that

458
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,080
turned on a light bulb that you know

459
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,320
this is good research. It's solving a

460
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,799
big problem with patient engagement,

461
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,559
access to care, health disparities. We

462
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,200
should be trying to find ways to bring

463
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,480
that to the real world. We showed

464
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,799
improvements in A1C for a very high risk

465
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,480
population. The mean A1C was 10, which

466
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,679
if you're a clinician, you know that's

467
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,919
very high um at baseline. And we had a

468
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,960
group of women who were, you know, not

469
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,000
necessarily sedentary um but you know

470
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,120
were needing to be a little bit more

471
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
physically active. And so what happens

472
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,320
after you do a successful research study

473
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,320
is you publish, right? you publish your

474
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,840
results, you publish a bunch of papers,

475
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,840
you present at research meetings and you

476
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,960
know you share your um success and then

477
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,840
you try to build on that success or

478
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,520
disseminate that success. And so my

479
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,559
experience as an implementation

480
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,200
specialist was, you know, I'm going to

481
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,240
try to disseminate this. But at the time

482
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,320
I was uh starting to get a lot of visits

483
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,679
from entrepreneurs like you asking me to

484
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,400
give my opinion about uh their ideas

485
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,480
about new products and I started to get

486
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
curious about what is the entrepreneur

487
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,440
process? Um what what are people doing?

488
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,280
And it seemed like they were moving a

489
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,159
lot faster than I could move as a as a

490
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,039
health services researcher. And so I

491
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:59,120
started to wonder how do I get into that

492
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,080
lane? What does it take to start to um

493
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,320
do uh dissemination through that

494
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,159
pathway? And that's what yes sorry to

495
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,159
interrupt before you go into the next

496
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,520
step there's a question on can you

497
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,320
elaborate more on the billing issues?

498
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,960
On the billing issue.

499
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,080
Yes. Yes. On the billing issue. So the

500
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,679
the issue with medical billing is um

501
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,320
that you um there the insurance

502
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:33,600
companies have um rates for uh how much

503
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,000
they would bill for a group visit versus

504
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,720
how much they would bill for a

505
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
one-on-one encounter. And so the group

506
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,280
visit model was um reimbursement was

507
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,520
much less than um the one-on-one

508
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,760
encounter. And so the people in the

509
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,919
group visit movement have managed to

510
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,559
figure out how to um circumvent that

511
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,280
although it still remains you know an

512
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,600
issue because as you may know there's

513
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,440
two models of of reimbursement from

514
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,360
insurance companies. There's valuebased

515
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,799
compensation where you get like a

516
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,600
monthly subscription or you bill fee for

517
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,480
service which is as people come you can

518
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,960
bill. Now, if you're billing and you

519
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,760
know you have everybody show up, then

520
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,320
you might be able to cover your costs

521
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,159
for implementing a group visit. But if

522
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,919
enough people don't show up, then you

523
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,120
don't get then you can't cover your cost

524
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,480
and then your model becomes, you know, a

525
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,360
a a problem for cost effectiveness. And

526
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,279
so if your major barrier is getting

527
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,760
people there and you can't bill unless

528
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,559
they come, then your model starts to

529
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,880
become weaker. And so, you know, group

530
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,000
visits at that time had faced the

531
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:50,400
barriers of um transportation and

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,919
no-shows that made the the model um

533
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
problematic for the most part.

534
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,840
Engagement was part of the issue as

535
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,400
well. Does that answer the question? I

536
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,279
think

537
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,520
and I guess and and there's another

538
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,600
question. How did you engage those with

539
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,559
limited digital literacy? Exactly. So,

540
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,240
so that was actually one of the most

541
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,120
illuminating um aspects of my what my

542
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,840
very first so the the paper that the my

543
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,840
very first um we did a feasibility study

544
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,400
and that was my introduction to this

545
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,799
work and I did the qualitative

546
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,880
assessment of the women who did

547
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,760
participate in the feasibility in the

548
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,520
feasibility study and at that in that

549
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,520
moment we enrolled 89 women over half of

550
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,400
them had never even sent an email. The

551
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,480
average age was 60 years old. They had

552
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,240
not just low health literacy, they had

553
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:50,240
low digital literacy and poor um poor

554
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,159
diabetes control. And so I was extremely

555
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,080
skeptical that they would be able to

556
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,279
participate in this program because the

557
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,799
the gaming platform was complex. we had

558
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:04,400
to give them um uh computers that would

559
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,120
run the um application and they had to

560
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,679
learn how to use a laptop. They you know

561
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,440
they didn't have they at that time the

562
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,360
many people didn't have smartphones,

563
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,000
they had flip phones. So the whole

564
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,120
aspect of teaching people how to

565
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,200
navigate the technology was part of the

566
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,960
development of agency towards the

567
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,559
disease. And that was what really

568
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,520
captured my attention was that teaching

569
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,799
people how to successfully use the

570
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,120
technology was actually giving them more

571
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,640
confidence to deal with the issues that

572
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,640
they were facing with the disease

573
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,640
management. And there's interesting

574
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,679
literature about that in education as

575
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,640
well that you know using technology to

576
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,360
help people build not just um digital

577
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,240
literacy but literacy about a subject

578
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,480
matter like health actually makes their

579
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,360
confidence in dealing with their health

580
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,520
um stronger and more actionable. And so

581
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,880
we had to create a instructional design

582
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,600
that integrated learning digital skills

583
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,320
with learning health um management

584
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,720
skills. And that's how we delivered our

585
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:18,240
platform. And so each we had people from

586
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,159
from 40 to 82 in women in control. And

587
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,000
some of them it took them longer, but

588
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,360
they were very they had a lot of

589
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
perseverance and we gave them um we we

590
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
gave them um training sessions and if

591
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
they needed extra training sessions, we

592
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,840
would give them individualized

593
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,159
attention. We also had the ability

594
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,559
because we were in control of the

595
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,360
laptops, we could uh remote into their

596
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,600
laptop if they got stuck and help them

597
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,440
get unstuck. So those tools helped us

598
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,960
navigate large groups of people at the

599
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,159
same time with different levels of

600
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,440
digital literacy and we still use those

601
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,600
skills today in seeyou yourself's

602
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,480
program hope app to help people with

603
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,159
digital literacy barriers.

604
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,360
Does that does that help? I think that

605
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:10,320
answers the question. Yeah. Great. All

606
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:13,600
right. So after um after we published um

607
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,320
I started doing talks and and sharing

608
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,600
the results with uh about our success

609
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,520
and um I met through one of my

610
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
presentations. I met the CEO at

611
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,399
Guisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania

612
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,559
which is known to be a very innovative

613
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,799
health system in terms of designing

614
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,399
health service um models and uh Dr.

615
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,760
Fineberg invited us to uh implement

616
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,720
women in control in Pennsylvania and

617
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,520
gave us our first contract and with that

618
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,279
funding I established seeyou yourself

619
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,640
health and um became an entrepreneur. I

620
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,480
it took me a long time I I really uh for

621
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,440
the most part would consider myself a

622
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,720
founder. I took me a long time to really

623
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,159
feel like an entrepreneur. Um but I

624
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,520
decided to take that opportunity to um

625
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,200
go on that journey and uh it's been a

626
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:14,159
life-changing experience uh to both um

627
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,279
try something new um that was really not

628
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,559
in my wheelhouse um and to uh learn the

629
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,559
skills that it takes to be an

630
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,799
entrepreneur. And I would love to ask

631
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,919
another question to the group and just

632
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,279
say who here woke up one day at 5 years

633
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,279
old and said I want to be an

634
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,279
entrepreneur.

635
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,799
I'm guessing that most of you thought I

636
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,840
I want to I want to have a lemonade

637
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,600
stand. Um maybe I want to have a I want

638
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,480
to be a fireman or a or a princess. Um,

639
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,039
but you know, most people most people

640
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,120
don't wake up and say, I you know, I

641
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,720
want to be an entrepreneur when I grow

642
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:58,000
up. And and and yet my greatest obstacle

643
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,760
was I'm not an entrepreneur. Like I

644
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,200
thought to be a doctor, you had to know

645
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,000
you wanted to be a doctor when you were

646
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,880
born. And I learned that, you know, you

647
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,679
could become a doctor. And so I kind of

648
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,840
used that I idea to um allow myself to

649
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,320
take the journey to become an

650
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,640
entrepreneur. And it really was the MIT

651
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,960
program that showed me that I could do

652
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,039
that. You know, I up until that time I

653
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,960
thought entrepreneurs were born and you

654
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,200
know that you you really had to have

655
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,559
that. Um and you do have to have a

656
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
certain disposition to be an

657
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,440
entrepreneur but you can learn what it

658
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,080
takes to be an entrepreneur. And I think

659
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,880
that was um something that I really

660
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,799
contribute to the MIT program um and my

661
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,159
experiences and in the boot camp that

662
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,240
taught me you can become an entrepreneur

663
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,000
um and but you can't do it alone. It's

664
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
definitely not something to do alone and

665
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,840
I I think that is important. So, we set

666
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,559
up um we used the funding from Guisinger

667
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:00,000
to set up See Yourself Health, which is

668
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,600
our um our early stage startup that's

669
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,279
still in the you know that we're still

670
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,039
building and we're still growing and

671
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,039
still launching. Um and we um our

672
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,000
platform is called the Hope app. The

673
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,080
Hope platform B really modeled on hope

674
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,320
uh healthy opportunities and personal

675
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,640
empowerment. And what we're doing is

676
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,520
delivering group- based care with an

677
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:25,360
immersive technology uh platform that we

678
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:28,240
call um immersive an immersive teleaalth

679
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,880
platform and what I had to learn going

680
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,799
from a health services research because

681
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,039
as a researcher your story is kind of

682
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,120
done a a lot of times once the research

683
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,279
is done and you either get an

684
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,519
implementation grant and you study

685
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,840
implementation or you go on to do

686
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,279
something different and your work is

687
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,039
done. Um, and but my experience was good

688
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,559
research should go out into the world

689
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,799
and serve. And so I started to try to

690
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,519
find how how do you take something out

691
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,880
into the world and sustain it outside of

692
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,840
a research um environment? And there was

693
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,080
a lot I had to learn along the way. And

694
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,320
you know, I think the first thing is one

695
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,240
way to do that is to, you know, get

696
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,640
people on your team that have experience

697
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,440
doing that and, you know, know how to do

698
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,159
it. But most entrepreneurs are, you

699
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,880
know, highly motivated, missiondriven

700
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,360
people with a vision, um, but don't know

701
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
all the steps it takes to be successful.

702
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,679
That's my experience. And, and I think

703
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,240
that, you know, it's a very steep

704
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,480
learning curve. Uh, but it's a it's a

705
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,039
very exciting journey and you I think

706
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,880
the the if you have the people to do it

707
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:42,399
that inspire you along the way, then it

708
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,880
can be a very positive experience. So uh

709
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,039
one of the questions that was uh asked

710
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,440
of me was what so what was the problem

711
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,559
that you were trying to solve? And uh

712
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,320
you know we focused on diabetes because

713
00:32:52,559 --> 00:33:00,799
women in control was we were resting our

714
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,559
um our our success on women in control.

715
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,720
And at that time the one of the

716
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,480
questions I was asked was what um

717
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,720
assumptions did you make along the way

718
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,519
that might have been incorrect? And one

719
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,000
of them was that my research was enough.

720
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,960
That my successful research program was

721
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,279
going to be enough to be um convincing

722
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,200
to get people to partner with me that

723
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,440
people would just be dying to partner

724
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,120
with me. Um kind of like what happened

725
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,760
with Project Red because uh you know

726
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,760
that's what my experience was. My what I

727
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,919
didn't realize was that one and this is

728
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,679
something you should be aware of you the

729
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,039
argument that people want to reduce

730
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,880
readmissions isn't the same for all

731
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
stakeholders in the healthcare

732
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,320
ecosystem.

733
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,480
two that you know um that different

734
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,039
stakeholders in in in the healthcare

735
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,880
ecosystem might need to be served at the

736
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,559
same time which is something new about

737
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,120
healthcare right if you're an

738
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,039
entrepreneur in another in another area

739
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,480
you might have one stakeholder that's

740
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,600
you know your decision maker in

741
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,079
healthcare it's multiple you need to you

742
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,320
know your your success depends on

743
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,040
patients adopting or providers adopting

744
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,440
your solution um and health plans being

745
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,280
willing to pay for it or somebody has to

746
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,440
be willing to pay for it. And so one of

747
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,000
my, you know, assumptions going into

748
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,760
this was my research success, you know,

749
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,679
outcomes were going to be enough to get

750
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,159
me um on the path to success. And and it

751
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,399
wasn't. It it got me to the first step,

752
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,599
which was with Guisinger. I I was

753
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,200
extremely fortunate that Dr. Fineberg

754
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,520
was um really um driven by patient

755
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,480
engagement and our success with patient

756
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,720
engagement was um you know the the thing

757
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,760
that got us started but it didn't get us

758
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,760
all the way there. Um so why did we

759
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,000
start diabetes? Because diabetes group

760
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,240
visits was the most established

761
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,119
evidence-based group visit but there are

762
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,119
other group visit models um that you can

763
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,240
translate to. And that's one of the

764
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,040
advantages of doing a platform that can

765
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,599
be translated to other verticals. But

766
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,640
the other thing I learned early in my

767
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,880
entrepreneur journey was stay focused.

768
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,079
Don't try to solve all the problems.

769
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,560
Stay focused. And so today I'm still

770
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,240
working on diabetes because one it's not

771
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,240
solved and two there's a huge business

772
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,480
case board study you know trying to

773
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,480
solve uh problems with diabetes and

774
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,119
three it's because that's where I have

775
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,119
the most experience um but you know

776
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,960
translating it now we have enough

777
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,920
expertise that we can start talking to

778
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,160
people about translating what we do for

779
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,880
people with substance use disorders for

780
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,280
caregivers for I have a group with

781
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,520
autism them uh that's interested in our

782
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,760
platform and our instructional design.

783
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,160
So, you know, that's another lesson that

784
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,200
I had to learn was the discipline of

785
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,119
staying focused. And so, the problem we

786
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,520
were solving is and and this is

787
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,200
something as an entrepreneur

788
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,920
I I I don't know if how long I can't

789
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,720
tell you how many times I had to iterate

790
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,520
on the problem statement. And so if you

791
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,960
find yourself, you know, a year from now

792
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,880
still trying to refine your problem

793
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,560
statement, you're not alone. This is a

794
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,440
hard thing to define. It's very hard to

795
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,119
be able to say your problem statement in

796
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,160
a way that makes, you know, that makes

797
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,720
sense. And so our problem statement is

798
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,640
living with diabetes is a full-time job.

799
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,920
That's what our patients told us. We've

800
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,280
talked to hundreds of patients and many

801
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,599
health um many health system leaders and

802
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,320
and health plan leaders. We did um

803
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,000
participate in the NIH C3I program and

804
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,560
did all the whole customer discovery

805
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,520
process. Um and at this point, you know,

806
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,800
my my informed what was really informing

807
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,680
me was my patient um input. And so

808
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,640
diabetes, a full-time job. Twothirds of

809
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,599
37 million people living with diabetes

810
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,680
struggle to manage their care. And as a

811
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,440
result, almost half have poorly

812
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,079
controlled diabetes, which leads to

813
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,640
complications, unnecessary hospital

814
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,680
visits, consequences, long-term

815
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,839
consequences, and higher cost. And the

816
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,280
hard part about diabetes is what you see

817
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,800
in front of you. There's four

818
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,560
stakeholders.

819
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,000
There's people who are working as care

820
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,680
managers. There's health plan

821
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,880
executives, there's providers, and

822
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,520
there's patients all in the, you know,

823
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,320
stakeholder chain of um, you know,

824
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,880
people that could be impacted by your

825
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,440
product. And so understanding, you know,

826
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,880
who is the where is your entryway into

827
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
the market, which one of these

828
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,760
stakeholders is going to get you there,

829
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,880
um, is important to, you know, your

830
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,200
success in going to market. So 7% of

831
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,359
people with diabetes don't get the

832
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,839
self-management education. they need to

833
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,880
actually be successful in managing it.

834
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,040
As a result, health plans pay, you know,

835
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
two and a half to three times more for a

836
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,359
diabetes patient than they do for a

837
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,640
person with well-controlled diabetes or

838
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,520
no diabetes. There's high rates of ER

839
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,000
use because of that. And half of people

840
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,720
end up facing consequences.

841
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,560
So, as you go on your entrepreneur

842
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,119
journey, you'll become familiar with the

843
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,240
idea of having a persona.

844
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,839
So Martha is our persona. Meet Martha.

845
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,320
Martha is a composite of all the

846
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,880
patients I've ever met with diabetes.

847
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,720
And this like living with diabetes, a

848
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,599
full-time job is a quote from one of my

849
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,000
patients. Martha is probably been living

850
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,320
with diabetes for five years or more.

851
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,880
She has had her ups and downs most of

852
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,560
her life, managing weight and then

853
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,240
managing pre-diabetes and then

854
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,680
ultimately being diagnosed with

855
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,680
diabetes. She is feeling exhausted and

856
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,000
burned out with her attempts to get her

857
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,920
diabetes under control and is starting

858
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,040
to experience a phenomenon known as

859
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,760
burnout, diabetes burnout. And she's not

860
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,040
taking her medicines and she's, you

861
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,720
know, kind of in a a place of giving up.

862
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,280
And as a result, her risk for

863
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,040
complications is increased four-fold.

864
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,440
Her cost of care is going up because

865
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,440
she's facing acute complications. She's

866
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,839
disengaged, not showing up for

867
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,240
appointments, and she has poor control.

868
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,800
And that's this person is experiencing

869
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,760
what we call diabetes distress. And it's

870
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,320
an actual marker that we tr that we

871
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,280
monitor our patients for and is an

872
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,680
indicator of one, who is our target

873
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,760
patient. It's a person with a high

874
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,000
diabetes distress score, and we've

875
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,920
confirmed that with our research data,

876
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,880
and it's a person who's most likely to

877
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,480
improve quickly with our support. And so

878
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,079
when you're thinking about who is your

879
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,000
persona, that's the kind of person

880
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,640
you're, you know, you want to identify

881
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,359
to that level of specificity, you know,

882
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,000
and I would add Martha has a smartphone

883
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,560
and she's comfortable using a tablet,

884
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,480
but she doesn't really use computers and

885
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,520
so she has a little bit of a digital

886
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,560
barrier um to using our tablet, but

887
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,079
she's not um she she's open to learning

888
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,079
and that is our persona. So what is the

889
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,440
problem is self-management? If you're

890
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,839
not familiar with self-management,

891
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,240
substance use disorder requires a

892
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,359
tremendous amount of self-management.

893
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,280
All chronic diseases require patients to

894
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,640
manage complex medications, diet,

895
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,560
exercise, stress, uh navigating the

896
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,680
health care system. There's eight

897
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,480
pillars that people need to master in

898
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,440
over a lifetime in order to live well

899
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,440
with a chronic disease. And what we know

900
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,640
is what I've told you, self-management

901
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,000
training in its form has been successful

902
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,960
but unscalable. And so what you see is

903
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,440
low engagement, limited access. The

904
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,839
benefits Wayne because Medicare only

905
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,119
pays for eight sessions in a patient's

906
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,960
lifetime. There's difficult workflow in

907
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,599
primary care settings, low

908
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,480
reimbursement, and as a result, costly

909
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,560
consequences. So this is the problem

910
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,960
that we are, you know, that we were

911
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,000
really trying to solve is how do we help

912
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,240
people become high-erforming partners in

913
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,720
chronic disease management that meets

914
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,880
the needs at the population level so

915
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,440
that we can actually serve the epidemic

916
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,839
of people every year being diagnosed

917
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,520
with diabetes. I I want to pause for a

918
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,680
second. I saw a couple of hands go up

919
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,480
and I just want to see um if there are

920
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,119
questions coming through that we can um

921
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,160
address before we go further. Anybody

922
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,480
want to question? Yeah, there are some

923
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,440
I'll read them because I think you may

924
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,000
mention it as you go ahead and you can

925
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,240
choose how to answer them. So one is

926
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,640
from Mark is diabetes is a huge market

927
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,800
with large numbers of competitors. From

928
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,960
a market segmentation point of view,

929
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,920
what angle did you decide to follow and

930
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,000
why? Uh from Roger, how pivotal was to

931
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,400
have your clinical trial published and

932
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,960
then and done to fund sorry and launch

933
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,760
your company.

934
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:18,240
Maybe one how long was it? How pivotal?

935
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,359
Oh, how pivotal. How key? Yeah. Yeah.

936
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,839
Yeah. Okay. So, I'm going to talk about

937
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,160
the competitors and and the the intense

938
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,000
competition in diabetes um in a couple

939
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,440
of more slides. So, I I'll pause I'll

940
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
hold off on that one. Um how you know I

941
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,240
actually started trying to uh

942
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,240
disseminate women in control before I

943
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,960
published my findings. Um and so that of

944
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,599
in the middle of the pandemic which was

945
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,040
you know really it was very challenging.

946
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:54,640
I I actually that was another assumption

947
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,680
that I had to face which was have one

948
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,119
having the CEO's support was critical

949
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,920
but it wasn't enough that I had to have

950
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,839
the support of other people in the

951
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,720
system and there were people that were

952
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:13,520
not in support of us and we ended up

953
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:16,720
having significant challenges staying in

954
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,640
uh the the system and and getting the

955
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,119
support that we needed to actually

956
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,160
recruit people to the program. I would

957
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,000
say be very careful in that environment

958
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,000
and I can talk to you a little bit more

959
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,200
about how you navigate those

960
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,440
relationships because even if the CEO

961
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,040
says good, come and bring your platform

962
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,200
to my comp my huge company, there's a

963
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,200
whole infrastructure of people that have

964
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,520
to support that in order for you to be

965
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,560
successful. And if you don't navigate it

966
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,680
carefully, uh you'll find yourself in in

967
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,480
hot political water with um people. Um

968
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,800
we we I learned that, you know, lesson

969
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,119
early. Um the other piece was um so

970
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,160
having I had evidence it hadn't been

971
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,160
published. It is important depending on

972
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,800
who you're talking to. Doctors love

973
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,359
evidence. Health system leaders, you

974
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,319
know, appreciate it. But then the health

975
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,200
plans, you know, really want to see um

976
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,200
results and uh you know, what they

977
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,040
called real world results, which I I

978
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,200
couldn't really understand because I

979
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,200
felt like I had real world results. I

980
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,119
still feel like I have heal and and what

981
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,520
you really need are is a network and

982
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,880
connections, not just results are not

983
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,520
enough. you need a network of adviserss

984
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,400
to help you enter the ecosystem because

985
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,440
if you don't it's going to be impossible

986
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,319
to to compete and and those

987
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,200
relationships take a long time to forge.

988
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,280
So I just you know it's a it's a

989
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,920
cautionary tale but you know people do

990
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,480
it it's it people are successful but it

991
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,319
takes a lot of uh perseverance to to do

992
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,440
it. Uh so use your literature to use

993
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:02,480
your your evidence to u get people's

994
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,720
attention but you know be aware that it

995
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,119
won't be enough and one thing I would

996
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,359
mention is like we were in you know in

997
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,079
guisinger implementing

998
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,560
and it seemed like a natural fit for a

999
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,240
teleaalth platform serving diabetes

1000
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,480
patients to be promoted but when um an

1001
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,960
epidemic is coming that nobody knows how

1002
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,480
to manage you know everything else is

1003
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,960
extraneous and so were we. And so um you

1004
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,960
know we were sunseted we kept all the

1005
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,800
patients that we had but we were

1006
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,359
sunsetted because they were really

1007
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,000
started to just focus on you know ICU

1008
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,319
beds and ventilators and that was a

1009
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,640
surprise to me as well. So, you know,

1010
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,040
health systems, health plans, you know,

1011
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,760
they have priorities that you may not

1012
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,680
make sense to you, but u the more you

1013
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,920
can understand, you know, what it feels

1014
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,000
like to be in that position, the better

1015
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,119
you can anticipate potential bumps in

1016
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,960
the road. Um, so we managed to do our

1017
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,560
demonstration, we managed to get our

1018
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,599
company funded, but then we had to

1019
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,880
figure out a way forward after that. So,

1020
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,400
our solution Yes. Go ahead. Just so I

1021
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,880
think that Thank you so much. I think

1022
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,200
that addresses the how did you

1023
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,119
commercialize your research idea and

1024
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,800
also if later you can talk a little more

1025
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,640
about how hard this is in in corporate

1026
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,119
and another question is was your focus

1027
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,800
only in the Medicare population or did

1028
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,680
you also have the commercial population?

1029
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Uh the diabetes epidem is pretty broad

1030
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:36,640
especially in employee population etc.

1031
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,680
Yeah. So we were looking for the

1032
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,079
unserved population. So if you've read

1033
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,560
Clayton Christensen and the disruptors

1034
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,280
dilemma, you know, we knew this was a

1035
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,839
crowded space and I felt at the time

1036
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,000
that we were going to need to find a way

1037
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,680
to differentiate ourselves and one of

1038
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,400
the ways that we differentiated

1039
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,079
ourselves was by working with a Medicaid

1040
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,240
population. So even though we were

1041
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,920
working with middle and older aged

1042
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:08,240
adults, um Medicaid was really at the

1043
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,720
time, you know, untapped and also, you

1044
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,560
know, uh trying to work with an older

1045
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,960
adult population with a technology

1046
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,440
platform. So our niche was to look at

1047
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,280
Medicaid, which at that time now

1048
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,119
Medicaid has become incredibly

1049
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,000
fashionable. And there's a lot of people

1050
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,119
trying to get into Medicaid managed care

1051
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,119
uh plan um programs, but at that time

1052
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,319
Medicaid was not and people weren't

1053
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,560
really looking at Medicaid. They were

1054
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,480
looking more at employers and commercial

1055
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,040
plans where there was seemed to be more

1056
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,520
money and maybe more patients where

1057
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,400
technology was more familiar. So we were

1058
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,319
trying to really serve the unserved

1059
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,560
where there was no alternative. And even

1060
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,599
today I can tell you I'm working in a

1061
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,880
market where the alternative is to us is

1062
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,240
nothing. And so that's an advantage. If

1063
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,599
you're thinking about how to go to

1064
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,599
market, find a place where the

1065
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,440
alternative is nothing because then

1066
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,839
people have nothing to lose by working

1067
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,240
with you and you know everything to

1068
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,839
gain. And so we've used that advantage.

1069
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,560
Our advantage is being able to engage

1070
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,480
highly engage. You know I use patient

1071
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,040
engagement as a differentiator. our

1072
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,040
ability to engage Medicaid populations.

1073
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,520
And I can talk more about that business

1074
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,119
model in a couple of sides. It's, you

1075
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,440
know, you need to kind of if you want to

1076
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,319
differentiate yourself, you need to find

1077
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,559
a part a way into the market that isn't

1078
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,400
crowded. And and that's at least was my

1079
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,280
experience. And so we differentiate

1080
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,839
ourselves that way and um you know have

1081
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,319
really tried to work with uh health care

1082
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,720
providers that are serving you know

1083
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,359
Medicaid populations. I can talk more

1084
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,079
about that as we go along. Uh just

1085
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:51,040
quickly, you know, our solution to the

1086
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,680
problem was to develop a techn an a

1087
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,680
technology platform that wasn't just

1088
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,000
Zoom. Like this was one of our big

1089
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,760
challenges was why not Zoom, right?

1090
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,640
Because now we're facing the pandemic

1091
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,000
and everybody is getting on Zoom calls

1092
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,800
and um and and why would they need to go

1093
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,720
into a gamified platform? And so it was

1094
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,319
a big challenge for us. And this is

1095
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,559
another thing about entrepreneurship.

1096
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,319
You never know when the playing field's

1097
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,520
going to change on you, you know, and

1098
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:23,280
so, uh, we had to be agile and and pivot

1099
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:26,079
and and really face the threat that Zoom

1100
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,920
was going to take us out. And what

1101
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,760
happened and I I just was like, okay,

1102
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,119
well, now we just have to embrace the

1103
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,359
the challenge. and Zoom was really

1104
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,400
pivotal, but at some point people were

1105
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,559
like, I can't I don't want to look at a

1106
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,720
at Hollywood Squares anymore. I need

1107
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,280
something engaging and interactive. And

1108
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,440
so it really helped us understand what

1109
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,520
we were bringing to the table, which

1110
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,440
was, you know, an environment that was

1111
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,440
interactive, that was engaging and

1112
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,760
whimsical with an instructional design

1113
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,720
that helped people not only connect to

1114
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,119
others, but to master the complex skills

1115
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,520
they needed to implement every day that

1116
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,920
would be available to them all the time,

1117
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,720
not just eight sessions in a lifetime.

1118
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,640
And that is our value proposition. What

1119
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,040
we've been trying to prove to health

1120
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,800
plans is that this is more coste

1121
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,119
effective than fee for service one, you

1122
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,319
know, once in a lifetime trying to get

1123
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,400
people to be effective partners in care

1124
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,400
and deliver these complex plans. And

1125
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,520
that's that is, you know, what we how

1126
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,240
we're going to market. So our platform

1127
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,880
is an is an immersive platform. People

1128
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,079
get an avatar, they navigate it with an

1129
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,200
avatar, they engage in health behaviors

1130
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:43,040
that are designed to prime their real

1131
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,160
life behavior change. And there's

1132
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,559
neuroscience that supports this. And our

1133
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,800
experience working with patients shows,

1134
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:54,400
you know, if we create engage them this

1135
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,480
way, engaging them in yoga, dance, uh

1136
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,520
physical activity, calisthenics, as well

1137
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,559
as teaching them, you know, other key

1138
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,040
actionable behaviors. We see behavior

1139
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,839
change, improvements in uh disease

1140
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,280
control and long-term engagement. And

1141
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:14,800
so, uh, our platform uses VOIPE for

1142
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,800
speech and and text chatting as well as

1143
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,359
3D interactive, um, exhibits to teach

1144
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,280
them how things work like how does a CGM

1145
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,000
work and and those kind of things. Our

1146
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,480
outcomes showed that we can improve uh,

1147
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,440
health system costs, improve glycemic

1148
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,280
control. Interestingly, emotional

1149
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,400
distress, you know, that diabetes

1150
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,319
distress uh aspect also improves uh

1151
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,559
while improving patient engagement and

1152
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,559
adherence to self-management. This is

1153
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,880
all based on a scientific foundation

1154
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,640
that I won't go into unless you're you

1155
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,119
want to ask questions about it, but we

1156
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,960
use um the experience of presence,

1157
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,800
self-presence, physical presence, and

1158
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,400
social presence in our instructional

1159
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,800
design to engage people in a highly

1160
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,960
immersive experience. Our patients do

1161
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,559
not use headsets. They don't like

1162
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,720
headsets. They do, you know, we had a

1163
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,520
lot of negative feedback with headsets.

1164
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,760
So, we use and and also just access to

1165
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,839
this technology. People in our pop

1166
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,160
target population don't even have a

1167
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:16,400
tablet. So, we are partnered with a

1168
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,720
company called PCs for people that help

1169
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,599
us get refurbished devices that people

1170
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,040
can um have to participate in our

1171
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,599
program.

1172
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,119
So these are the study the you know

1173
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,520
these are the results from women in

1174
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,079
control. These are my proof point that

1175
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,839
we get 70% engagement significant

1176
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,160
improvements in glucose control in a

1177
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,720
short period of time reduce cost and

1178
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,160
reduce mental health distress and that's

1179
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:44,400
our value proposition in a you know in a

1180
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,880
population that's very high risk and

1181
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,640
difficult to access. And you know,

1182
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,040
people always want to know how do your

1183
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,559
patients feel about the experience. And

1184
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:57,200
so we have tons of documentation about

1185
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,000
patient focus groups in key informant

1186
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,319
interviews about how the experience uh

1187
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,920
helps them improve their lifestyle

1188
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,559
management.

1189
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,800
And so the story about going from a

1190
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,640
research project to scale, you know,

1191
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,040
really comes from going from a research

1192
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,200
environment to a real world environment.

1193
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,680
The biggest lesson is how do you

1194
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,000
navigate that real world environment?

1195
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,000
How do you engage clinicians? How do you

1196
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,920
engage health plan leaders? How do you

1197
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,559
engage health system leaders so that

1198
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,880
they support your implementation?

1199
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,800
After Guisinger, we needed to find

1200
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,400
additional funding so we could continue

1201
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,559
to make our platform scalable. One key

1202
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,040
thing that happened to us, we learned

1203
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,040
that when we went to Guisinger, people

1204
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,920
wanted to participate and they couldn't

1205
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:47,119
download the application. They had no

1206
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,200
all they had were tablets or work

1207
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,119
computers. They couldn't download it.

1208
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,760
And so we had to figure out how to

1209
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,720
create a cloud gaming solution. And

1210
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,359
today it seems so yesterday, but at that

1211
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,319
time nobody could answer my question

1212
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,960
about how to do this. And so my partner

1213
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:07,280
Oscar Cortez helped us create a cloud

1214
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,920
gaming solution so that people could

1215
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,160
access our platform on a tablet or a

1216
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,319
Chromebook. And that was a very

1217
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,920
important step forward for us otherwise

1218
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,359
we would never have been able to succeed

1219
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,920
at Guisinger. So a technology glitch

1220
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,960
that really pushed us to make a more

1221
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,960
scalable platform um happen happened in

1222
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,079
our you know experience in trying to go

1223
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:32,000
to market after the pandemic hit and our

1224
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,359
sun and our program was sunseted. We

1225
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,359
needed to figure out how to get

1226
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,920
additional funding to continue to make

1227
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,920
our platform scalable from all the

1228
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,599
lessons we learned at Guisinger and we

1229
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,559
turned to the SBIR program at the NIH.

1230
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:49,920
We successfully won phase one and phase

1231
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,160
two funding and um that has allowed us

1232
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,520
to advance our platform so it's

1233
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:58,160
integrable with an EMR system to help us

1234
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,599
track patient reported outcomes and risk

1235
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,240
scores um and to make a a scalable

1236
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,440
immersive environment that actually can

1237
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,280
be navigated easily um by patients of

1238
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,000
all levels of digital literacy. So

1239
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,680
that's where we are right now is uh and

1240
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,839
we're implementing with a health plan

1241
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,760
partner Molina Health Plan a national

1242
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,280
Medicaid managed care plan in the state

1243
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,280
of Kentucky um to demonstrate that we

1244
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,280
can once again build traction with our

1245
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,040
newly designed platform in this

1246
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,160
population.

1247
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,480
So just in terms of competitor I know um

1248
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,160
people asked about competitors. It's

1249
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,559
important to know who your competitors

1250
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,200
are. They're they haven't remarkably

1251
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,839
changed very much. So the gold standard

1252
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:45,520
was you know in-person self-management

1253
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:47,839
education 9 hours in a lifetime. Other

1254
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,599
uh digital health competitors have come

1255
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,720
in the market are really well

1256
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,359
established is Mada and Labongo. Um but

1257
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,720
the thing they don't bring is the live

1258
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:01,040
peer action um experience the immersive

1259
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,559
experience that we think makes a a

1260
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,240
really important difference in our

1261
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,640
demographic. Um in in addition tracking

1262
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,760
apps that track people's behaviors are

1263
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,839
also things that uh people use to manage

1264
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,160
their self their their self-management

1265
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,280
needs. Our vision is a platform that

1266
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,000
integrates data from different sources

1267
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,480
to create a living breathing experience

1268
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,680
for people um in similar to what would

1269
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,839
be called digital twinning. Um just

1270
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:33,839
looking at seeyou yourself health's hook

1271
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:36,559
platform versus new weight watchers lark

1272
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,480
these are our major competitors I think

1273
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,040
our main thing is the immersive

1274
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,319
liveaction programming our expertise

1275
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,200
with Medicaid populations and our um NIH

1276
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:49,760
researchbacked evidence.

1277
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,079
Uh so the market if you really look at

1278
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,599
the market it you know the diabetes

1279
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:58,559
market in and of itself is is enormous

1280
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:01,599
and and it's incredibly competitive. If

1281
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,920
you you know if you span out to

1282
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,160
pre-diabetes and and even the weight

1283
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,480
loss market is even a a richer

1284
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,960
environment. The number of potential

1285
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,200
people to serve is enormous. 96 million

1286
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,200
people living with pre-diabetes

1287
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,760
um and uh or at risk at least um and 37

1288
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,760
million with type 2 diabetes. I mean the

1289
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,319
there's just the numbers are staggering

1290
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,799
and and it gets you you don't have to

1291
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,559
touch every life to be successful.

1292
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,040
That's the good part of a a problem like

1293
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,920
diabetes. But you know the competition

1294
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:37,520
is stiff and it's very difficult to

1295
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,839
partner with um health plans. So I can

1296
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,960
talk more about that. The business model

1297
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,520
that we use is um a valuebased

1298
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,599
reimbursement model. So we are

1299
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,319
partnering with Molina on a per member

1300
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,480
per month subscription. So the and we

1301
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:55,680
get paid based on patient engagement and

1302
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:58,240
enrollment. And then we hope that with

1303
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,920
that initial success with just based on

1304
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:04,640
traction that we will negotiate a bonus

1305
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,000
um pay for performance shared savings

1306
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:10,559
kind of bonus where we are responsible

1307
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,720
for a population and the cost of that

1308
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,200
population um you know we're not

1309
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,520
responsible for their costs but we if we

1310
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,559
can show an impact on the cost then we

1311
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,200
get a cost share and that can be a

1312
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,200
significant in you know additional

1313
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,920
source of revenue. So, just this per

1314
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,119
member per month uh reimbursement is

1315
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,680
about $800 per person if you can keep

1316
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,440
them engaged for for the year. And and

1317
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,839
we've been we have people in our program

1318
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,160
who've been with us for five years. So,

1319
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:43,440
you know, we're showing, you know, some

1320
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,760
good numbers for long-term use. Um but

1321
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,520
even short-term use, the market is so

1322
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,599
big, you know, you can have a

1323
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,440
sustainable business um even just

1324
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,920
getting, you know, somebody engaged for

1325
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,640
a year. Um, and then there's also fee

1326
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,240
for service options as well as direct to

1327
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,480
consumer, but right now we're really

1328
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,400
trying to uh demonstrate that we can

1329
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,440
work with health plans because they just

1330
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,599
have control of a lot of the market.

1331
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,200
This is my team and I can tell you more

1332
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,520
about them, but I can tell you right

1333
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,599
now, you can't do it without a team and

1334
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,079
you can't do it without a good um team

1335
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,040
with diverse skills um that can tolerate

1336
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:22,000
the uncertainty and the difficulties

1337
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,000
that it takes to um endure, you know,

1338
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,160
this experience. So, you know, you

1339
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,119
really it's worth finding people that

1340
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:32,240
you can work with that uh can endure the

1341
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:33,760
challenges and the ups and downs. Uh so,

1342
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,000
a couple of other questions that were

1343
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,760
asked. um you know what regulatory stuff

1344
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,040
have we encountered? The biggest one is

1345
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:44,480
HIPPA. We haven't tried to get FDA

1346
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,400
approval as a medical therapeutic at

1347
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,280
this point. We are trying to go to

1348
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,480
market without that. But HIPPA is a huge

1349
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,079
obstacle with technology platforms. Um

1350
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,400
anything about working with partners,

1351
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,880
providers and payers, it's hard. It's

1352
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,920
really hard to work with them. They it

1353
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,559
takes years to de develop real

1354
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,119
partnerships with them. They are, you

1355
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,040
know, they are, you know, they are

1356
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,960
running the ship. They have control of

1357
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,680
the lives. They get to decide what

1358
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,599
people have access to. They, you know,

1359
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,760
can decide what they want to reimburse

1360
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,520
people for. And the only leverage you

1361
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,520
have is with the government. The

1362
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,359
government, you know, they have to honor

1363
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,680
what the government requires from them.

1364
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,680
So, in our case, the government requires

1365
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,880
them to provide self-management

1366
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,720
education uh and support. So you know

1367
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,079
that's something they need to deliver

1368
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,000
and we leverage that. Also Molina worked

1369
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,520
with us because of a health equity

1370
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,119
initiative that they are trying to

1371
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,640
implement in Kentucky. There's

1372
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,960
significant and published disparities in

1373
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,240
outcomes among minority populations. And

1374
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,240
so uh they brought us in as a health um

1375
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,280
health equity initiative. So you can

1376
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,200
find ways to partner if you can

1377
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,240
understand what the health plan's needs

1378
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,079
and priorities are. And and I think I

1379
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,200
mentioned most of these assumptions that

1380
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,359
I that prove to be wrong. Uh one is you

1381
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,839
definitely need lawyers and good ones

1382
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,160
because the the further you get down the

1383
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:14,480
road, the bumpier it will be and the

1384
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,040
more legal advice you need to get. Um,

1385
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,599
and it's not, you know, I had to learn

1386
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,440
that, you know, if you don't skin your

1387
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,319
knees, you're not playing hard enough.

1388
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:28,000
It's scary. It's scary when you get, you

1389
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:29,839
know, into legal um, contention with

1390
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,920
somebody, but it's important and

1391
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:35,839
navigable, but you just got to have good

1392
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:38,400
lawyers. Um, making mistakes is not the

1393
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:40,079
end of the world. You know, we you have

1394
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,160
like I almost think you have to make

1395
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,680
mistakes, but you feel kind of bad when

1396
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,760
you do. And um but it's inevitable um

1397
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,400
that you'll make mistakes and and learn

1398
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,359
from them. So, you know, you can get the

1399
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,680
best advice you can get um and that's

1400
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:58,160
that's what you can do proactively is

1401
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,000
try to have good advisors, but don't

1402
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,000
don't beat yourself up if you're making

1403
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,799
mistakes. And and the most important

1404
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,079
thing is to be educable, coachable, and

1405
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,079
and to learn from them. So, I'm gonna

1406
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,319
I'm going to stop sharing and and open

1407
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,119
up the floor for questions. And thank

1408
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:18,079
you um very much from the bottom of my

1409
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,119
heart for listening to my story and you

1410
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:23,839
know um I hope that um you find some

1411
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:27,160
benefit in it. So what other questions

1412
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:27,160
do you have?

1413
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,359
I think it would be great if you can

1414
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:39,040
talk a little more about like selling to

1415
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:42,480
the big organizations and and also like

1416
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:45,359
why did you decide to go for the four

1417
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:49,040
like um target audiences, right? You

1418
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:53,440
could have chosen one or two. Yeah. Or

1419
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:56,319
three. Yes. So I would say that um you

1420
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,559
know we kind of learned this

1421
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:04,160
we we're still learning it to some

1422
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:06,000
extent. So we we I was not I didn't

1423
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,160
realize that we would have so much

1424
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,480
trouble getting partnered with health

1425
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:13,440
plans. I really thought that it would be

1426
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,000
my experience with Project Red was, you

1427
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,200
know, in some ways it was kind of a

1428
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,680
fairy tale of, you know, like something

1429
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,799
happened at in, you know, once in a

1430
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,720
lifetime and and and the demand for our

1431
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:29,920
product just took off with a life of its

1432
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:32,960
own in a unicorn kind of way, I guess.

1433
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,520
Um, but mo the real world is that those

1434
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,920
relationships are hard to forge and and

1435
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,920
even harder to keep. And so um you know

1436
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,119
sometimes that's an important role for

1437
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,799
an advisor or an investor right that you

1438
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:50,000
know if you're working with investors.

1439
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:52,480
Now I'll tell you my very first group of

1440
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,160
adviserss sat me down and told me to

1441
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:59,680
build my company with um non-diluted

1442
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,839
funding for as long as I could. And um

1443
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:04,559
there's pros and cons to that. The road

1444
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:07,520
is slower for sure with non-diluted

1445
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:10,319
funding, but you remain in control of

1446
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:14,160
your destiny. And I think that for in

1447
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:16,000
some ways that is important that you um

1448
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,000
you know are able to fulfill your vision

1449
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,079
without the pressure of you know

1450
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,960
generating revenue um when you're not

1451
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,119
ready for it. And so I think that's an

1452
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,200
important thing to consider. If you find

1453
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,520
the right investment partner, that can

1454
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,000
be a dream come true. You know, somebody

1455
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,920
who a group of people that are, you

1456
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,480
know, so um you know, committed and

1457
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,119
generous uh and and can wait it out. But

1458
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,960
at an early stage startup, like making

1459
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,760
money is not going to happen for a very

1460
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,319
long time. And so you've got to find a

1461
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,200
way to, you know, find partners that are

1462
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:53,039
can can stick it out with you. Um I'll I

1463
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,160
I saw a question about diluted and

1464
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,760
non-diluted funding. And so, uh, you

1465
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,839
know, when you take on an investor,

1466
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,880
usually there's a cost, right? The

1467
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:04,640
investor wants a piece of equity, um, in

1468
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,520
the company for the money that they give

1469
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,280
you. And depending on how much value you

1470
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,960
have in the company at the time that the

1471
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,440
investor um, makes the commitment, they

1472
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,680
will be able to request more of your

1473
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,000
company. And eventually as your company

1474
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:23,039
and your success grows, you can diminish

1475
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,359
your your ownership and your control

1476
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,200
over your vision to the point where some

1477
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:29,280
people lose their company entirely and

1478
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:31,920
and get displaced. And that's a true

1479
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:35,359
story. Sometimes it's a you know, it's

1480
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:39,839
not entirely negative, but it's a it's

1481
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:41,680
it's a true story. And so, um, we kind

1482
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,359
of decided that once we, you know,

1483
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,359
because of our first contract with

1484
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:48,079
Guisinger, we really were able to go

1485
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:51,520
into our first kind of preede round

1486
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:53,119
without, um, giving up any equity and we

1487
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,920
got, you know, a half a million dollars

1488
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,680
in that contract. And then, but from

1489
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,960
there, you know, I was kind of trying to

1490
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,559
figure out where are we going to go from

1491
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,880
here? Um, and going to the NIH just felt

1492
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,680
familiar to me to be perfectly honest. I

1493
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,319
knew how to navigate the NIH. I wasn't

1494
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,559
that familiar navigating investors and

1495
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:15,200
you know my adviserss really pushed the

1496
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,280
idea of not engaging an envir you know

1497
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,480
investor partner until we were further

1498
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:23,039
along where we would have more leverage

1499
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,440
um to negotiate you know a better

1500
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:28,640
agreement. And so we uh went for the

1501
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,720
SBIR funding and I just I'm a good

1502
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:34,160
writer. I'm a good researcher and I'm a

1503
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,960
good grant writer. And so we have been

1504
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:39,119
very successful with the SBIR program.

1505
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,599
If you don't know about SBIS, I'm happy

1506
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:43,760
to talk to you at length about it. Um

1507
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,079
and and how you can be successful with

1508
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,440
that um funding. It's it's really you

1509
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,839
can get up to five four or five million

1510
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,240
on a single idea. And there's people

1511
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:56,799
whose companies just keep putting in

1512
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,760
SBIRS and getting more funding doing

1513
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,799
different types of projects. Um, and so

1514
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,160
you can have as many SBIRs as you want.

1515
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:06,319
Um, at some point you have to

1516
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,880
demonstrate that you're you know you're

1517
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:10,640
getting commercial success, but it's a

1518
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,119
it's a great way to get non-diluted

1519
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,480
funding if you can. You also have to

1520
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,640
realize though working with the

1521
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,319
government is also a pain in the neck

1522
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,480
and you there's a lot of things you have

1523
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:22,799
to abide by working with the government.

1524
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,880
But that's my bread and butter. I know

1525
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:28,640
it really well. So that has worked out

1526
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:31,599
well for us and we've gone a long way um

1527
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,520
in getting to our go to market strategy

1528
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:37,599
working with a a national health plan

1529
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:40,240
partner um and and getting traction in a

1530
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,559
um in a Medicaid market. So I'm happy to

1531
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:45,200
tell you more about that um if there's

1532
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,440
if if you're interested. I see a couple

1533
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,440
of hands up in grid. What where should I

1534
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,440
go?

1535
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:59,359
We can uh but with that on Donica Donica

1536
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:02,079
us hi. So firstly I wanted to just thank

1537
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:04,480
you for sharing your um your journey. I

1538
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,640
have a women's femalth startup called

1539
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,280
wingwomen. We do virtual and inerson

1540
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:12,319
gynecology family planning coaching and

1541
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,640
doulaare. We're also in Massachusetts

1542
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:18,560
um serving the Medicare and Medicaid

1543
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,159
patient population. So, I appreciate um

1544
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,080
meeting and running into another founder

1545
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,759
that has navigated that because with

1546
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,440
startups, it's not always common that

1547
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,199
people will go after that patient

1548
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,199
population because of the complexity.

1549
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,960
And then to your point around dealing

1550
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:34,719
with investors, a lot of them don't want

1551
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:39,520
to deal with the government. Yeah. Um,

1552
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:42,480
so again, I appreciate your um, honesty

1553
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,120
about that piece as well as um, trying

1554
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:48,640
to wait as long as possible before

1555
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:51,920
taking investor money. My question was

1556
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,759
at this point, have you taken any

1557
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,440
investor money? And then for those of us

1558
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,239
because our company has already taken a

1559
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:01,520
bit of venture when you've hit periods

1560
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:04,319
where you just need to kind of I'm just

1561
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:07,120
going to do like air quotes grind and

1562
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,960
grow where there's not a lot of revenue

1563
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,719
coming in like how to kind of position

1564
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,679
those milestones and those wins when

1565
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,880
it's not translating into dollars. Um,

1566
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,400
and then for those of you guys who

1567
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,440
haven't taken investor money or don't

1568
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:24,239
know, just if you take it, usually you

1569
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:26,319
have to give them a monthly and or

1570
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:28,159
quarterly snapshot of how much money is

1571
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,960
in your bank account, what your burn

1572
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:33,040
rate is, um, anything you have coming

1573
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,640
up, so they have constant access to how

1574
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,839
much money you have at any given time

1575
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:43,359
the moment you take it. So, um, with

1576
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:45,279
that in mind, um, kind of how to

1577
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,359
position those milestones and those wins

1578
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:51,759
when it doesn't translate into dollars.

1579
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:55,199
Yeah. So, I had one period where we were

1580
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:58,560
running on fumes um, and interns were

1581
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:01,840
helping. Um, so, thank you, Gifty. and

1582
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,960
and uh we you know we didn't we we were

1583
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,880
waiting for our phase two and we were

1584
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,800
running out of our phase one and we

1585
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,360
weren't generating revenue. We were

1586
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,960
generating a little bit of revenue and

1587
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:17,760
doing side gigs with our platform but it

1588
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,920
was you know we were we still needed to

1589
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,360
do more development on the platform in

1590
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,600
order to be able to partner around cyber

1591
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,440
security. So, if you're going to work in

1592
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,000
healthcare, don't wait till the last

1593
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,239
minute to think about cyber security and

1594
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,360
HIPPA because when you want to that's

1595
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:38,960
another piece of if you want to partner

1596
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:42,480
with a large health plan, you need to be

1597
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:47,199
able to play at that level of security

1598
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:49,600
and that means have insurance.

1599
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:53,679
I hear somebody's

1600
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,560
do you hear that? Okay. So um it's uh so

1601
01:10:53,679 --> 01:11:00,239
you have to be able to show that you can

1602
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,880
deliver secure data sharing. You have to

1603
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:06,000
have a a a significant amount of

1604
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,760
insurance that secures you. Um you have

1605
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,320
to accept it, you know, a significant

1606
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,400
amount of risk for data sharing. So if

1607
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:15,679
you want to play ball with payers and

1608
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:18,000
and big employers, you have to be able

1609
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,400
to com you know reassure them that you

1610
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,880
have the ability to manage the data

1611
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,360
because that's their biggest risk. And

1612
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,640
it's it's a very you know we failed our

1613
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,520
first security audit which was that was

1614
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,440
another eyeopening experience like I had

1615
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,760
no idea and the guy practically laughed

1616
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:38,320
us out of the zoom room you know because

1617
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:40,719
we were so poorly prepared and you know

1618
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:43,679
we we learned quickly what you needed to

1619
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:45,520
be um in you know to be able to partner

1620
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,400
with a large help plan and that was a

1621
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,560
growing pain and so we were in that

1622
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:54,560
window of needing to develop that cyber

1623
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:57,120
security Um, and I honestly I played

1624
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,360
poker. Um,

1625
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,360
Donica, I played some poker there where

1626
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,199
I didn't have enough money to do what I

1627
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:05,679
needed to do and I was trying to build

1628
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,360
it and and and you know that's the

1629
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,320
entrepreneurs's journey like you're

1630
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:14,000
playing poker a little bit. um you know

1631
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:17,360
as you're because those those contracts

1632
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,679
take a long two years to get a signature

1633
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,520
on a contract and you know you can't

1634
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,679
believe the way the lawyers will talk

1635
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,960
about you know what you're going to do

1636
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,560
you know you're trying to you think

1637
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,199
you're trying to serve patients and they

1638
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,520
are just you know layering on all these

1639
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,280
other complexities and so it takes a

1640
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,760
long time. If you sit around and wait

1641
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,960
for that ink to dry, you will not be

1642
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:42,320
prepared when when when go when the time

1643
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:44,480
comes to hit go. So, you know, you have

1644
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,800
to deal with that timeline. We were in

1645
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,880
that donut hole where we were waiting

1646
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,880
for our phase 2 funding. Our phase one

1647
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,880
was gone. We're barely kind of keeping

1648
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,920
the lights on. and we did take on an

1649
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,080
investor um with a safe note and it was

1650
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,920
a small amount of money and we don't

1651
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:05,120
give him any kind of reports uh but he

1652
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:07,120
is still a good friend to us. He's

1653
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,560
somebody I met on an airplane. You never

1654
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,920
know who's sitting next to you on an

1655
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,400
airplane. Um and you know he's he's a

1656
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,880
good friend to us. Uh and we are in

1657
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:19,120
still in debt to him for um for that

1658
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:22,000
funding but it got us through to our

1659
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,400
phase 2 funding. So sometimes if you can

1660
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,880
find that I would say don't wait to

1661
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:29,920
develop your your partner your

1662
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,840
relationship network with investors uh

1663
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,440
while you're using non-diluted funding

1664
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,520
because you you know you never know when

1665
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,480
you might need that investor to step in

1666
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,960
and help you out. But we just know that

1667
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:43,040
when you do it, there will be, you know,

1668
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,400
some you'll be giving up some of your

1669
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,480
freedom, um, some of your equity. But

1670
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,040
for some people that's, you know, that

1671
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:54,560
actually helped them get to win. So I I

1672
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,960
don't judge, um, either way as better. I

1673
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,800
I think it's very dependent on who you

1674
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,880
are, what you're doing, and the kind of

1675
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:05,280
investment partners you're able to work

1676
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:07,679
with. Yeah.

1677
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,080
Any other questions specifically? I can

1678
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,080
talk more about working with big um

1679
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:15,600
health plans or what it means to work

1680
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:19,520
with a m Medicaid managed care plan or

1681
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:22,320
the business model. Anybody have any I

1682
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:25,120
see a hand up. Roger.

1683
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:29,280
Yeah. Yeah, I wanted to ask you uh if

1684
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:31,679
you so with the SSB, SBBR or the

1685
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,719
business program at the NIH,

1686
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:37,120
if you were

1687
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,120
when you wrote that proposal,

1688
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,320
is this something you were leading the

1689
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,920
company or you were partnering with a

1690
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,239
different company while you kept your

1691
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,320
academic position or how did you

1692
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,159
navigate that

1693
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:53,120
uh that process? Have any conflict of

1694
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:55,520
interest or um just curious? So you know

1695
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:58,239
the sorry so when you develop something

1696
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,800
in an academic environment usually the

1697
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:04,159
uh academic institution will have

1698
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,199
intellectual property rights. I went to

1699
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:10,719
beu and I told them I wanted to do you

1700
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:13,040
know do this in they had no interest

1701
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,159
and I was like so I can just go do this

1702
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,480
by myself and they were like yeah we're

1703
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:20,960
not you know we we're not interested and

1704
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,360
I was like okay first of all I was

1705
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,679
devastated because I thought I I was

1706
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:29,199
just devastated like how could they not

1707
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:32,880
want to do this with me but I also felt

1708
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:36,239
freedom to go do it on my own and um and

1709
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,640
So, but that was not easy and and also

1710
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:42,000
you know the again I would say the point

1711
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,239
in time you know BEu wasn't really on

1712
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,640
the like they were looking at patents

1713
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,960
and engineering but what software would

1714
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,679
bring wasn't really on their radar and

1715
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,400
so because this was a software

1716
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,920
um type of innovation they just didn't

1717
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,679
you know they weren't that interested

1718
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,440
and so um so initially I was just this

1719
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,800
was like a plant on my window sill

1720
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,640
that's what I say it was like little

1721
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,719
plant on my window sill that I was

1722
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,080
trying to see if it was going to grow

1723
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:12,480
and you know the the critical thing was

1724
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,640
you know when I met Dr. Fineberg and and

1725
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,360
you know he gave me that opportunity to

1726
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,400
implement in Pennsylvania. I kept my day

1727
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:23,600
job. I kept my research job and I you

1728
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:25,840
know brought people along that uh you

1729
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,400
know helped me do that implementation

1730
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:31,679
and and were co-founders really at that

1731
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,920
time. Um and you know that my team has

1732
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,480
had some turnover in the last five years

1733
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:39,280
that you know that was also difficult

1734
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:41,679
but you really need if you're going from

1735
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,520
a research to a entrepreneurship you

1736
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,280
need to understand what tech transfer

1737
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,760
means and go to your tech transfer

1738
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:50,159
office because it's not the end of the

1739
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,400
world if they you know have some equity

1740
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:55,760
you just have to put it in writing so

1741
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,159
you know how like basically if you de

1742
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,159
develop something at an institution like

1743
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:02,400
an academic institution ution what

1744
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:05,280
wherever the product is at that time is

1745
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,920
what they own and anything if you take

1746
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,480
it out of the institution then you know

1747
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,000
they own what you know they own a at

1748
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,360
least some of the intellectual property

1749
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,440
of where it was them but you're going to

1750
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,920
build on it grow it change it do things

1751
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:20,880
with it maybe make it a lot better um

1752
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,560
their rights are limited um to what was

1753
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,960
you know what was available at the time

1754
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,199
of the tech transfer depending on the

1755
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:30,320
institution and how they deal with text

1756
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:33,520
transfers so be sure you clear those,

1757
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:35,679
you know, bar those kind of regulatory

1758
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,800
um barriers if you're working in a

1759
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:41,280
research environment. That's important.

1760
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:46,440
Yeah.

1761
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:46,440
Thank you. Yeah. Sure.

1762
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:55,600
And do I have one final question or

1763
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,199
I will somehow Well, I was going to ask

1764
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,159
if it's I don't know if I don't see any

1765
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,679
other hands, but I'm going to ask again.

1766
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:01,520
And this is Adonica again. Sorry, I'm

1767
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:04,159
just really excited to hear from you.

1768
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,159
Um,

1769
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,440
uh, just I would just say from

1770
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:09,440
experience, there are some harsh

1771
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:12,320
realities around being a female founder

1772
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:14,960
and then navigating in this space that,

1773
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:18,800
um, don't often come up until you

1774
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:21,600
learned a hard lesson. Yeah. Can you

1775
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:24,719
share maybe a hard lesson you learned

1776
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:28,560
and just like a piece of practical

1777
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:30,159
advice um for you know for all of us? I

1778
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,239
know it doesn't have to be specific to

1779
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:33,679
being a female founder. I just I call

1780
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:36,239
that out because you're a female founder

1781
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,560
and it's sometimes rare to engage with a

1782
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:40,640
female founder in this space because it

1783
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,159
can be really difficult to navigate

1784
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,920
especially if you don't have an advanced

1785
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:48,560
degree or um uh certain partnerships in

1786
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,320
place. And I would just kind of love to

1787
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,480
hear like something practical that you

1788
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,400
learned um even if it was a really

1789
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,000
really harsh lesson. I know you shared

1790
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,159
the example about kind of being laughed

1791
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,280
off of the phone for not being prepared.

1792
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,800
And I'm like I'm listening to you. I'm

1793
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,159
like I have such a hard time believing

1794
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,840
that. But I've also been in those

1795
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,679
situations. You can be brilliant and

1796
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,360
noteworthy and all of the things and

1797
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:10,800
still be unprepared for what actually

1798
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,560
happens in those meetings. But I would

1799
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:15,040
just love to hear another like story if

1800
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,280
you had one to share.

1801
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,520
I have a lot of them actually. I mean,

1802
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:22,320
thank you for bringing it up because I I

1803
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:26,239
don't like to lead with that. I was part

1804
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:29,440
of the mass life sciences nextgen

1805
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:31,600
program. Uh I was in the second cohort

1806
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,120
of women entrepreneurs

1807
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:37,920
and

1808
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:40,880
um I at first I wasn't like in my entire

1809
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:44,159
career and in medicine

1810
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,640
I never felt treated differently because

1811
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:48,960
of being a woman. I felt like it was all

1812
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:52,080
really based on,

1813
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:54,480
you know, your academic and and your

1814
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,480
skill as a physician. And, you know, I

1815
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,400
felt always evaluated based on my

1816
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,679
ability or my, you know,

1817
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:04,239
accomplishments. Um, until I started

1818
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,600
trying to navigate the entrepreneur

1819
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:10,080
field and initially I thought I was

1820
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:13,600
crazy. I was like, this is weird. I'm

1821
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:16,880
having these I'm having this really uh

1822
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,679
challenging time connecting or making

1823
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:23,760
connections or or or st you know

1824
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:28,320
competing and then I went to um a

1825
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:32,560
program that Babson I think um hosted

1826
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:35,199
and they had five investors

1827
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,159
um and the theme was about um

1828
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:40,320
disparities against women founders

1829
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:42,880
and it was profound. found. I mean,

1830
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,719
first I felt validated. I I felt like

1831
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,560
something I was experiencing and

1832
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:48,960
couldn't name and label, I guess, what

1833
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,320
we would call a microaggression

1834
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:54,320
was real, that I wasn't crazy. I also

1835
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,640
think there's some agism. It's not just

1836
01:20:54,320 --> 01:21:00,320
about gender. Um, you know, there's some

1837
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,719
agism. I I had a woman

1838
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:07,120
uh who was a mentor and an investor in a

1839
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:09,040
seed uh group, invest angel group, say,

1840
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:13,199
"Suzanne, what are you going to do?

1841
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:16,080
you're a doctor, a woman, you know, and

1842
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:17,679
um a a a scientist. So, she named three

1843
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,080
things. She's like, "You're never gonna

1844
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:22,800
make it." And I was like, "I can't

1845
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,320
believe that someone had like I think

1846
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,000
she thought she was letting me down

1847
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,800
easy."

1848
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,760
And I I couldn't believe that she even

1849
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,080
like said it to me as a woman, you know,

1850
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,000
and I was like, I thought those were

1851
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:39,040
going to be advantages.

1852
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,480
I thought being a physician with

1853
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:45,520
research and a research track record and

1854
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:49,040
implementation expertise was going to be

1855
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:52,719
enough. And um and it definitely was not

1856
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:55,280
just not enough. It was sometimes it was

1857
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,199
um a red flag. My people are like, "Oh,

1858
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:59,360
doctors are terrible business people.

1859
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:04,400
Doctors are terrible

1860
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:09,120
um managers." And um I and you know I I

1861
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:11,440
mean like those I stood up at um one of

1862
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,840
the mass challenge

1863
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:18,159
um this entrepreneur

1864
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,840
uh program for women to pitch and we

1865
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:23,600
were supposed to be getting practice

1866
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:27,920
pitching from you know a group of 30 you

1867
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:30,320
know uh people in in um health sciences

1868
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:33,040
pharma all these things right so you're

1869
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,719
like totally vulnerable. You're standing

1870
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:39,120
up there

1871
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:44,639
and it was almost all men in the room

1872
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:47,199
and this one guy who knew me from beu

1873
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:49,120
just started railing on me. It it just

1874
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:52,080
started and and it wasn't even about my

1875
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:54,960
pitch. It was you know just about you

1876
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:57,760
know my presence, my you know like my

1877
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,520
tone of voice. It was it wasn't even

1878
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,480
about like you should have brought the

1879
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:06,239
content from the end up front or I and I

1880
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:09,360
I had I I walked out of there. I was I

1881
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:11,840
thank goodness I had a strong mentor

1882
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:15,120
network that I you know because they

1883
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,360
picked me up. That was a very difficult

1884
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,120
experience. It was first of all it was

1885
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,440
very difficult to have that happen to me

1886
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:24,800
in front of an audience and here I was

1887
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:29,760
like I was used to public speaking in

1888
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:32,080
front of you know very elite scientists

1889
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,080
you know like I was used to being in

1890
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,400
front of people it wasn't that it was

1891
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,639
the way I was treated in that

1892
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:41,600
environment as somebody who didn't you

1893
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:45,679
know warrant respect and it took me a

1894
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:48,320
long time to digest that and finally me

1895
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,880
um write a letter because this was

1896
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:53,520
supposed to be a program to lift up

1897
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,920
woman entrepreneurs and you know it

1898
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:59,520
reminded me a lot of experiences I had

1899
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:03,360
in medical school um that were were

1900
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,520
harsh and toxic and so I feel like you

1901
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,040
know learning experiences are meant to

1902
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:11,679
be you know you know help people grow

1903
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:14,719
and I felt like I was treated that way

1904
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:18,480
because of you know um because of all

1905
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:23,199
the stereotypes that I represented and

1906
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:27,040
um I do this mentoring and um I mentor

1907
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:29,199
women in my company because you know I

1908
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,960
don't want them to have that experience

1909
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:34,000
and if they do I don't want them to be

1910
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:36,159
without a network to support them and so

1911
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,440
you know I would just say that you are

1912
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:42,400
not immune to having that happen to you

1913
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,920
whe no matter who you are I think you

1914
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,400
know you're not immune into having that

1915
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,639
experience, you'll need to have people

1916
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:51,280
that can help you navigate it, make some

1917
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,120
meaning out of it and move forward and

1918
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,960
know that next time it happens, you

1919
01:24:53,120 --> 01:25:00,480
won't be um taken down as as um you

1920
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:02,480
know, as harshly. And I tried to turn it

1921
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,320
into an experience where I could, you

1922
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:08,960
know, grow. Um so I feel like um you

1923
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,840
know, this entrepreneur experience, the

1924
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,679
startup world can be harsh. I it can be

1925
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,440
full of the hard knocks kind of

1926
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:18,239
philosophy, but it doesn't have to be.

1927
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:20,480
Um and it and it really shouldn't be. So

1928
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:23,440
don't take it if you're if you're facing

1929
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:26,480
it, but you know, try to um handle it

1930
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:31,040
with grace and and dignity. That's my

1931
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:33,360
that's my advice. So I thank you. Yes.

1932
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,239
And I'm happy I'm looking forward to

1933
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,800
