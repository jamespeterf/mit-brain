00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
Modern warehouse automation brings a lot

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,600
of productivity to warehouse facilities.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,840
But it also brings a lot of new risks.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,920
It can go from a cyber attack to power

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,679
and network outages or just technology

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,240
failure. The warehouse management system

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
or WMS, the central brain of warehouse

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,039
operations for many years used to be

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,199
running in a single facility. Now all

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,439
the WS's are being combined into a

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,439
single WMS. So that brings a lot of

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,519
efficiency, but it also presents a huge

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,880
risk. For example, a cyber attack can

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,960
bring down the whole network of

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,280
warehouses. One of the main things they

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
need to start doing is leveraging AI for

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
cyber security first. It can actually

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
prevent some of the attacks by detecting

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,559
those malicious hackers beforehand, but

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,960
it can also be used for an automated

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
response. So, if a cyber attack is

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
already happening, the AI tool can

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
actually be the one fighting that cyber

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,399
attack in advance.
