1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,040
For our final panel
this afternoon,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
we're joined by the Living
Climate Futures Lab.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,120
This is a project that received
seed funding from MITHIC

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,080
through its faculty-driven
initiative program.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,760
So we have two presenters,
Chris Walley and Amah Edoh

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
from anthropology.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,440
After they present,
they'll be joined

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,920
on the stage with
Kate Brown from STS,

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,920
Janelle Knox-Hayes from
Urban Studies and Planning,

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,247
and Laura Frye-Levine
from anthropology.

12
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:37,080
And they'll be moderating
their conversation

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,320
by Evelyn Wang, the MIT
vice president for energy

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,240
and climate.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,720
So, Chris and Amah.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,340
Thank you.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,497
[APPLAUSE]

18
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:47,400

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:47,980
Thank you.

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,680

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,540
Hi, everyone.

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm Chris Walley from--

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
sorry, Professor.

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,240
Professor and Head
of Anthropology.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,360
And I'm Amah Edoh,
research scientist,

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,590
and serving as managing director
of the Living Climate Futures

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,794
Lab.

28
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:05,550
And we just wanted
to say thanks so much

29
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,570
to the donors who have
made MITHIC possible,

30
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,990
and to the SHASS Dean's
Office and the whole MITHIC

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,850
crew, who've been so fabulous.

32
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,350
We're truly honored to be the
recipients of the first MITHIC

33
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,470
Faculty-Driven Initiative Award.

34
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,610
So we are a
collaborative initiative.

35
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,190
There are 20 people, 20
researchers currently involved

36
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,190
in the lab.

37
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,850
And folks have been
coming in and out.

38
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,110
But maybe the LCFL members
who are here, if you can just

39
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,670
wave so we see who you are.

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,250
There you go.

41
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,690
Very few of us are here, but hi.

42
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,990
A number of folks are teaching.

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,550
Yep, and there's Chris.

44
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,010
And so we wanted to
start with the video.

45
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,510
It's a short five-minute video
that we made with earlier MITHIC

46
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,470
funding to show the
foundations of the lab

47
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,286
and tell you a little bit
more about how we came about.

48
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,310
When we think about
climate change

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,900
as a scientific problem or
a technological problem,

51
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,740
we often forget then that
climate change is also

52
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,840
a social problem.

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,918
It's a cultural problem.

54
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,960
It's a political problem.

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,860
It's an economic problem.

56
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,660
MIT students come here
wanting to change the world

57
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,980
and wanting to come
up with solutions

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
to impossible problems.

59
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,460
When I was a student, what
felt like that was missing

60
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,000
for me was constantly
asking the question,

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,500
how does this relate to
what's happening in the world?

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,660
Social scientists
can serve as a bridge

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,380
among different communities
of scholars, communities

64
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,680
of engineers, as well
as Native communities,

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,460
agricultural, urban communities.

66
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,980
What the Living Climate Futures
Lab is going to do is listen,

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,980
and to ask questions, and to
learn the ways in which people

68
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,840
are grappling with this in
their everyday lives right now.

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,983

70
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,900
There are populations
that have been grappling

71
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,760
with these issues for
a long time already,

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,660
and that have developed
a lot of knowledge.

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,440
And this lab is an opportunity
to invite that knowledge

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,560
and help grow that
knowledge in a way that

75
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,360
can benefit all of us.

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,460
We decided to do this
conference a couple years ago.

77
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,680
And the idea was, can we
bring these community partners

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,040
that we're working with
to MIT, host this space,

79
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,140
and see what comes out
of this conversation?

80
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,200
Ohio has a very certain
idea of what farming is,

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,620
and it's not what we're doing.

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,860
These changes take time,
and they take effort.

83
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,540
And they need true dedication.

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,020
Change happens at
the speed of trust.

85
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,760
And that speed of trust
has a lot of different ways

86
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,040
to get to it.

87
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
We had Indigenous leaders
from the Pacific Northwest

88
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,422
and from North Carolina.

89
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:38,880
We had environmental
justice groups

90
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,460
from Chicago and from Boston.

91
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,880
We had urban farmers from Ohio
and from the New England area.

92
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,400
When I deal with
communities that

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,500
are on the front line of
an environmental stress,

94
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,120
they often feel alone.

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,060
And so when we brought
people together,

96
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,810
I think that really
gave people of boost.

97
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,510
It told them that
there's all kinds

98
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,450
of other people and resources
out there to help them.

99
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:00,950
When

100
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,510
You look in Indigenous lands
that Indigenous peoples

101
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,510
have stewarded, we see
much greater biodiversity.

102
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,630
It hits on a lot of what
Indigenous peoples' knowledges

103
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,130
have said for millennia.

104
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,450
It's about relationships.

105
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,750
It's understanding how the world
works in an interconnected way.

106
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,070
Working with communities,
it is really important

107
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,630
to build long-term
relationships and not

108
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,690
create extractive
forms of relationships.

109
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,312

110
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,630
[INAUDIBLE] photograph.

111
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,270

112
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,750
Professor Mike Short
with Professor Munkhbat

113
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,430
has this molten
salt heat bank that

114
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,550
has been produced in the lab.

115
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,710
But we need to make it work
in people's homes in Mongolia.

116
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,790
So anthropology steps in.

117
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,140
The intention is to learn about
how Mongolians use technology

118
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,940
and what could work in
a particular setting.

119
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,900
We have the opportunity to work
with students at the National

120
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,420
University of Mongolia,
and it was honestly

121
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,700
one of the greatest
experiences of my life.

122
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,740
We debriefed almost
every night about what

123
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,000
has been discovered, what
is the engineering side,

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
and what is the
ethnographic side,

125
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,500
to the point where students
gained this fluency

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,860
to merge two
disciplines together in

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,340
such a smart,
culturally-sensitive way.

128
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,720
So much of the MIT education
this is the way the world is.

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,040
It's very black and white.

130
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,320
It's so common to say,
well, I see a problem.

131
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,620
I can come up with a series
of technical solutions

132
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,700
that, if everyone behaves
I think they will, then

133
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,300
it's going to work.

134
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,520
And yet, when students get
out into the real world,

135
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,980
they realize nothing does.

136
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,300
It takes cultivating
relationships.

137
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,580
That's what our students
have learned, too.

138
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,820
I learned so much
more about the project

139
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,170
and about what the
future of this project

140
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,890
could look like than I think
if we had just gone alone.

141
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,410
The discourses of urgency,
crisis, speed and scale

142
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,850
in the context of solutions
just keeps coming up.

143
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,650
Who are those partners
in communities

144
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,530
that we want to engage,
and what should be

145
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,570
included in this conversation?

146
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,262
Why aren't we training students
to work with communities?

147
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,970
Why aren't we training
them to understand

148
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,385
different ways of knowing?

149
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:16,010
It's a really good
example of something

150
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,890
that we should be
doing across the board.

151
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,650
The Living Climate Futures Lab
is a unique opportunity for MIT

152
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,090
to stand as a leader in the
response to climate change.

153
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,930
It's extremely meaningful
for a school that

154
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,390
is known for STEM to
say, hey, the social,

155
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,690
and the cultural are as
important as the technological

156
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,450
and the scientific.

157
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,332
Yeah.

158
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,224
[MUSIC PLAYING]

159
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:43,670

160
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,090
[APPLAUSE]

161
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,320
Maybe you could leave it
on the picture of everybody

162
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,240
until the post comes up?

163
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,640
Oops, nope.

164
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,480
There you go.

165
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,580
Great, thank you.

166
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,080
So, as mentioned
in the video, we're

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,840
committed to thinking
about climate change

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
in the more holistic
terms of how

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,160
it plays out in everyday life.

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,120
And by partnering with community
environmental organizations, who

171
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,578
are themselves living through
the effects of climate change

172
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:10,040
and developing
their own solutions

173
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,760
for how to mitigate
those effects,

174
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,100
we recognize that in order
to do this effectively,

175
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,440
we need to bring together
different forms of knowledge

176
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,440
and partner with those in
other fields, including STEM.

177
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,300
So this lab came about
because many of us,

178
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,960
as researchers, have for many
years, been working already

179
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,180
at the community level, not only
in the US, but internationally.

180
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,080
And we've seen how
well-intentioned policies

181
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,600
and programs by international
organizations, national agencies

182
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,000
and other institutions
too often fail or leave

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,325
behind a trail of
unintended consequences.

184
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,200
There are many reasons
for this, but the lack

185
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,140
of familiarity with particular
locations or populations,

186
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,660
or lack of substantive
or equitable partnerships

187
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,500
are some of the key factors.

188
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,900
As a consequence, many of us
have experienced firsthand,

189
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,620
as researchers, the often
enormous disconnect between what

190
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,340
such interventions
are assumed to do

191
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,700
in the abstract and the reality
of how such interventions play

192
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,900
out or fail to play
out in everyday life.

193
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,460
So our intent is
to think about how

194
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,100
to achieve what is often
referenced as scale and impact

195
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,260
differently.

196
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,440
So first, our focus is on
building long-term research,

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,020
partnerships, and connections
with community organizations

198
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,570
as a basis for building trust,
as was referenced in the video.

199
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,820
So we're operating with
different kinds of time frames

200
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,980
than are commonly used,
for example, in developing

201
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,650
technologies for markets or
generating venture capital,

202
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,900
where the assumption is that
showing immediate returns

203
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
is a key sign of success.

204
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,679
Taking time is part
of our secret sauce.

205
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,179
In the model we're developing
for the Living Climate Futures

206
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,940
Lab, we seek to
generate impact not

207
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,100
by replicating what
works in one location

208
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,460
and transferring that
to other locations.

209
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,300
Our goal is to
generate conversations

210
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,690
among those living in
very different places

211
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,310
that help push forward
thinking about what works,

212
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,130
without presuming those
solutions will look similar

213
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,370
across different locales.

214
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,290
So for all of us, what
we seek to scale up

215
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,170
is the process of
learning how to listen

216
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,130
across different groups, and to
explore place-based solutions

217
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,690
through collective
conversation, and by generating

218
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,863
what STS scholars call
a community of practice.

219
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,530
We envision the
community groups that we

220
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,050
partner with as similar
to a series of sensors

221
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,090
spread out across national
and global landscapes that

222
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,890
can tap into and offer a
reading of what is happening

223
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,988
in different locations.

224
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,530
To make this work,
we need to partner

225
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,450
across disciplines and
schools within universities.

226
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,170
We also have to learn to partner
with community organizations

227
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,730
in ways that are co-designed
and fully collaborative,

228
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,050
and that our community
partners themselves consider

229
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,410
to be ethical and equitable.

230
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,250
For example, while
marketable technologies

231
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,590
to address climate change
are absolutely critical,

232
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,450
our own path takes a
different orientation

233
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,530
to arrive at similar goals.

234
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,560
The emphasis for the
Living Climate Futures Lab

235
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,160
is on scaling knowledge
and showing impact

236
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,640
by extending out
horizontally to create

237
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,800
a more vibrant and equitable
research commons in often

238
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,800
overlooked locations.

239
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,160
And so to this
end, the lab's work

240
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,700
is articulated along two axes.

241
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,120
So the first one is
for the lab to serve

242
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
as a research hub,
where members can form

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,120
a community of practice,
as Chris was mentioning,

244
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,980
across SHASS and
STEM disciplines,

245
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,740
where they can learn
from one another,

246
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,298
develop new collaborations.

247
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:14,840
And you'll be hearing
more about some

248
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,960
of the research that's
happening during the panel

249
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,620
after this short overview.

250
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,120
But here, we just
have two examples

251
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,480
from the anthropology
department, Professor Amy

252
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,640
Moran-Thomas, who's working on
co-creating sensors in old coal

253
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,280
mining regions of Pennsylvania
that are being heavily impacted

254
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,760
environmentally and health
wise by natural gas extraction.

255
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,200
And Professor Sonya
Atalay, who is graciously

256
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,060
allowing us to learn
from the network

257
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,030
she's been developing-- the
Center for Braiding Indigenous

258
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,750
Knowledges and Science.

259
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,093
And we're learning how
to do just that, how

260
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,510
to bring these
different knowledge

261
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,190
systems into conversation.

262
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,630
In addition to a
research hub, we're

263
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,710
also generating a suite of
experiential learning classes

264
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,430
to train the next generation in
how to work across disciplines

265
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,882
and how to collaborate ethically
with community partners.

266
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:04,590
And those of you who've
been here all day

267
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,510
have heard again and again this
emphasis on returning to the

268
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,630
or enhancing the
MIT mens et manus

269
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,670
and teaching students by doing.

270
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,248
And so we wanted to
illustrate that it's late.

271
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:19,290
You've been here all day.

272
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,270
So we're showing videos because
it's easier to integrate.

273
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,930
And so we have another short
video from one of the classes,

274
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,930
Lab to Land.

275
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,310
And we're creating a
series of these minute

276
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,430
and a half, two-minute videos
to make our approach more

277
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,550
legible to students, but
then also to colleagues

278
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,710
across SHASS and STEM fields
and community partners.

279
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,490
And so.

280
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,620

281
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,500
Brianna Meier and I wanted to
create a class where students

282
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,260
have the possibility to
engage with communities

283
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,460
that have actually come up with
solutions to climate problems.

284
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,240
We piloted our field
school this summer.

285
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,980
We took two students out
to the Pacific Northwest

286
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,060
to engage with the actual
cultural landscapes.

287
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,140
One of our community partners,
Se'Si'Le are an Indigenous-led

288
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,260
environmental nonprofit that
has been dedicated to teaching

289
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,260
people about ancestral
Indigenous knowledges.

290
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,160
Se'Si'Le focuses on land,
water, and human rights,

291
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,300
in particular protecting
the Salish Sea.

292
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,140
Our legend goes our first
mother came from the water.

293
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,240
What does a mother do?

294
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,740
A mother feeds you.

295
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,000
So we start working with that.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,940
That's the beginning of our law.

297
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,980
The communities that we work
with follow that same law

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,810
and want to give back to the
things that provide for us.

299
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,060
It was really grounding,
just meeting a lot of people,

300
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,520
doing really good things,
doing good work, who just have

301
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,120
such a community base value.

302
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
There is a tendency
that the people

303
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,320
that you're learning
about, you learn

304
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,480
to see them as these symbols
versus actual people.

305
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,000
Living with them,
you get the chance

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,200
to actually meet them
as people and for them

307
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,400
to meet you as people,
as well, and to actually

308
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,000
form a connection.

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,240
One of the key concepts in the
class that we're engaging with

310
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,340
is the concept of
infrastructure,

311
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,720
and the notion that
infrastructures don't only

312
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,380
build physical and
material worlds,

313
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,520
but also build social worlds.

314
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,700
The best work that we've been
doing is in our own backyard,

315
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
and we continue to do that,
to be stewards of our land.

316
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,560
We've always been that
way, and we are now.

317
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,160
And we always will be.

318
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,040
That's who we are
as [INAUDIBLE].

319
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,440
Anybody can make a difference.

320
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,940
And that's the same at MIT,
whatever you're doing in school.

321
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,170
Let's create to enhance
with technology,

322
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,950
to make a world a better place.

323
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,150
This is something I
wrote in my field notes.

324
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,770
As a mechanical
engineering student,

325
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,030
I've been searching for
solutions, trying to problem

326
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,830
solve a way out of the hole
we seem to just keep digging.

327
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,850
But this trip helped me
organize my thoughts.

328
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,610
There's no engineering
without people,

329
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,370
no people without community, no
communities without the planet,

330
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,700
and no planet without balance.

331
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:12,153

332
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:15,534
[APPLAUSE]

333
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,983

334
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,990
So, you see, we
have a whole series

335
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,410
of courses that are coming.

336
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,910
And these videos will
be up on our website.

337
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,790
The next one that's coming up,
and that's just about done,

338
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,430
is for a class called Green
Steel, Green Jobs, which

339
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,030
is a course that explores
developing collaborations

340
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,470
across anthropology and
engineering to simultaneously

341
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,820
work on decarbonization
while also

342
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,900
trying to design for good jobs.

343
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,420
And with that, we
will transition

344
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,260
to the panel, where you'll
get to hear a bit more

345
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,820
about some of the research
underway in the lab.

346
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,740
Great.

347
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,360
Thank you.

348
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,692
[APPLAUSE]

349
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:59,720

350
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,220
Oh.

351
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,820

352
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,560
Sorry, sorry.

353
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,140

354
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,420
Are we supposed to
sit in this order?

355
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Oh.

356
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Are we--

357
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,700
We'll mix it up.

358
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,580
We'll mix it up.

359
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,247
Keep everything a
little more confusing.

360
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,640
[LAUGHTER]

361
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,140
Great.

362
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,432
Well, good afternoon, everyone.

363
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,580
I know we're the last
panel, but hope you'll

364
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,000
find this extremely exciting.

365
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,240
I think certainly from
the videos that we saw,

366
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,220
I think the Living
Climate Futures Lab

367
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,860
is such an inspiration.

368
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,560
And as I'm leading
the Climate Project,

369
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,010
I see so many synergies
and opportunities

370
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,770
to really collectively work
together, which I really

371
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,850
enjoy just hearing about
really the opportunities

372
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,492
for partnerships at MIT.

373
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,950
And I think the
more we can engage,

374
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,770
the more we can actually
affect and impact

375
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,350
people and communities.

376
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,890
But maybe we'll start, and just
with a round of introductions,

377
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,450
and maybe sharing a little
bit about what each of you

378
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,150
are working on in the context of
the Living Climate Futures Lab.

379
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,770
And I know Professor
Chris Walley has already

380
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,370
shared a little bit, but
maybe I'll ask you to start,

381
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:08,870
Sure.

382
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,050
Just super quickly, in
the interest of time,

383
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,550
so I Amah had mentioned the
class Green Steel, Green Jobs.

384
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,690
My work for many years,
I did earlier research

385
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,670
on environmental
issues in East Africa.

386
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,650
But in-- later after
that, I've been

387
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,150
working in the area
where I grew up,

388
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,870
Southeast Chicago, an old
steel mill neighborhood.

389
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,150
My father was a steelworker.

390
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,790
My grandfather
was a steelworker.

391
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,590
And so this class,
Green Steel, Green Jobs,

392
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,798
that's partnering with Elsa
Olivetti, and the Climate

393
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:34,648
Project, and others
is really, again,

394
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:36,940
as Amah mentioned, trying to
think about this question,

395
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,020
can we decarbonize?

396
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,740
At the same time, we don't
just automate away jobs.

397
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,260
How do we actually try to
create good jobs for people?

398
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,600
And so that's a lot of the
focus I'm bringing to this.

399
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,300
Hi, my name is
Laura Frye-Levine.

400
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,440
I am a research scientist
in anthropology.

401
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,280
My PhD is in sociology, and
I study sociology of science

402
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,440
and sociology of collaboration.

403
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:09,200
So I have a connectivity grant
from MITHIC to pilot integrated

404
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,800
research hub in SHASS for
conversations and research

405
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,119
engagement to integrate
across social science

406
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,560
and humanistic
disciplines, but also,

407
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,119
as well, to build community and
build research infrastructure

408
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,120
to solve climate
problems by bringing

409
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,060
in engineers and
scientists to figure out

410
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,300
how to integrate research.

411
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,000
Hi, everyone.

412
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,640
My name is Janelle Knox-Hayes.

413
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm a professor in the
Department of Urban Studies

414
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,960
and Planning, and I direct
the Resilient Communities Lab.

415
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,100
And so a lot of my
research projects

416
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,260
are about bringing
a community focus

417
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,700
into both thoughts of climate
mitigation, adaptation,

418
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,140
and then also thinking about
energy systems and transition,

419
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,260
and how to bring a
socio-technical lens

420
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,835
into technology development.

421
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,460
One of the things I
wanted to highlight

422
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,583
is our Indigenous
Environmental Planning class.

423
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,500
So we've been building
for the past five years

424
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,977
an Indigenous community
planning program within DUSP.

425
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:13,560
And this has probably been one
of our most successful efforts.

426
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,440
We now have three classes.

427
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,900
We've partnered with the
anthropology department

428
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,340
to bring incredible scholars
like Leslie Jonas, who's

429
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,820
a Mashpee Wampanoag
Eel Clan elder,

430
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,120
in to co-teach these
courses with us.

431
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,020
And Indigenous
Environmental Planning

432
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,490
is an amazing course in
that we bring together

433
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,490
multidisciplinary students,
and then pair them

434
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,830
with client projects.

435
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,690
And so we've worked
over the last five years

436
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,330
with more than 20 communities
around the United States.

437
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,210
And the student teams have
an amazing opportunity

438
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,890
to learn firsthand from
these Indigenous communities

439
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,550
to think about their lifeways,
their knowledge systems,

440
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,450
and how to bring that into
a focus in different facets

441
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,750
of urban planning.

442
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,850
So we've had really
successful projects

443
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,370
with the nation of Hawaii,
for example, exploring

444
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:03,010
their ahupua'a system, which
is reimagining or rethinking

445
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,610
planning from the standpoint of
from the mountain to the sea.

446
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,170
So the way in which
aquifers and watersheds

447
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,810
guide different thoughts
about economic transition

448
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,730
and economic integration.

449
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,770
And then, working with the
Shinnecock Indian Nation,

450
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,490
we've done a number of
projects over the years,

451
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,690
including redesigning
energy systems,

452
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,290
and thinking about
different forms of land use

453
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,280
planning, where students have
actually gone in and done

454
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,120
participatory action
mapping with tribal elders

455
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,700
to think about not just the
physical resources on-site,

456
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,880
but the cultural heritage
sites, and how to preserve

457
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,980
and integrate those.

458
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,160
So that's been probably a
really successful example

459
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,000
of how to take what we're trying
to do with the Living Climate

460
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,253
Futures Lab, partner with
the students, partner

461
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,920
with the communities, and bring
all of those different knowledge

462
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,520
systems together.

463
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,240
Hi, I'm Kate Brown.

464
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,880
I'm an environmental historian
in science, technology,

465
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,080
and society.

466
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,480
And I came to MIT as a historian
working in nuclear disaster

467
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,320
zones.

468
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,840
And at one point,
I realized, and I

469
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,120
saw thousands of people going
into the radioactive pripet

470
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,800
marshes around the zone,
picking blueberries

471
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,825
on an industrial scale.

472
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:15,200
I thought-- first
I thought, what

473
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
a shame to send these
radioactive blueberries

474
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,360
into global markets to end
up on your breakfast table.

475
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,640
But then I also
started to think,

476
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,150
these blueberries are doing
what an army of scientists,

477
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,690
and engineers, and Soviet
soldiers could not do.

478
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,750
They're cleaning
up the environment

479
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,430
and handling radioactive
waste to humans

480
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,070
in a neat little blue package.

481
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,270
And so I started--

482
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,550
I mean, I tried to advocate
that we pay these pickers

483
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,590
and dispose of the blueberries,
the mushrooms, and cranberries

484
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,150
as radioactive waste.

485
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,870
But that got me
thinking about how

486
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,310
plants can be our
allies in ways that

487
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,190
offer low-carbon, low-tech
solutions to the problems

488
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,270
that we have in the
anthropocene today.

489
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,030
And so then I got interested
in big cities, and the history

490
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,710
of big cities, and
self-provisioning,

491
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,370
and how as farmers exhausted
soils in the countryside,

492
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,690
they were impoverished.

493
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,510
They moved into cities
starting in the 1850s or so.

494
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,830
And when they got
there, they saw

495
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,650
all the nutrients they had
been growing in stripping,

496
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,415
mining from their fields, were
all sitting around as garbage.

497
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,040
And they're like,
don't throw that out.

498
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,980
I'll take it.

499
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,900
And they started building
these human engineered

500
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,860
soils that are the most
productive agriculture

501
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,167
in human history.

502
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,000
And so I'm just finishing
a book about that.

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
It's coming out in February.

504
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,662
And that got me into teaching.

505
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,120
I was like, oh, there's so much
more to explore about this.

506
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,660
So in January, I'm going to
teach a course in Spain, an IAP

507
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,160
course.

508
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,500
We're going to take
about 15 students

509
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,680
over to look at
regenerative agriculture,

510
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,940
which then leads to regenerative
economies in the Catalonia area.

511
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,900
And then in the
spring semester, I'm

512
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,740
teaching the second part of
a MITHIC-funded course called

513
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,300
Urban Resilience,
with an instructor

514
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,820
from architecture
and another one

515
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,500
from Art and
Agriculture Institute.

516
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,860
And together, we're going to
work with two urban farms who've

517
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,222
asked us for help.

518
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:11,180
And what the students
are going to do is design

519
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,640
and build capital-shaped
capital coops,

520
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,580
chicken coops in the
shape of the US capital.

521
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,120
And on them will be history
exhibits of the food sovereignty

522
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,420
movements, especially in
East and South Boston,

523
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,880
that have been really
powerful since the 1970s.

524
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,380
Great.

525
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,840
Well, thank you for those
great introductions.

526
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Maybe, Chris, I'll
start off with you.

527
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,880
I certainly appreciate
the lab's focus

528
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,880
on the impact of climate change
on people's everyday lives.

529
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,340
And at the MIT Climate Project--

530
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,080
and we're very
much thinking also

531
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,840
about the scale of
communities, because we

532
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,720
think that is the unit of
change that will really

533
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,480
help us really think about
this holistic global challenge.

534
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
But the one question we're
always grappling with,

535
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,160
what is really a community?

536
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,520
And what exactly is a scale?

537
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,220
It could be a small town,
say, at the Coast of Cambodia.

538
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,760
It could be a very
large city like Chicago.

539
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,400
So how do you think about
that in terms of the diversity

540
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,400
of contexts in your approach?

541
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,100
Yeah, that's a great question.

542
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,460
And anthropology, actually,
when we use "communities,"

543
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,575
we often use it in quotes.

544
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,950
And actually, in
my first book, I

545
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,010
had a whole chapter on taking
apart the concept of community.

546
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,770
But it can be a
helpful one, as well.

547
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,210
I mean, communities, as we
know, they're heterogeneous.

548
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,090
People move around.

549
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,770
They're diverse.

550
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,490
You can't bound something
easily as a community.

551
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,390
But nonetheless,
climate change effects

552
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,150
play out in people's
everyday lives.

553
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,830
And so what are the
place-based ways

554
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,140
in which these things play out?

555
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,890
Who are the leaders
who are already there?

556
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,050
What are the community
groups already at work?

557
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,462
How can we bring
those in to partner

558
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,670
with in ways that they're
also translating for others

559
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,450
in the places where they are?

560
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,310
And so hopefully the
focus we're bringing

561
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,450
is both the kind of power
of working at this level,

562
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,825
but at the same
time, recognizing

563
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:02,270
that kind of diversity
and heterogeneity,

564
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,790
and how that's also a source
for thinking more creatively

565
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,430
about these kinds of questions.

566
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,190
So I don't know if other folks--
there's plenty in the room also

567
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,717
who work on at
this level of work,

568
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,050
if others have thoughts on that.

569
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,130
But anyway.

570
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,040
Any others you want
to comment on that?

571
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,200
Just speaking as a
sociologist of science,

572
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,380
working at this intersection
of collaborative, large-scale

573
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,800
efforts that involve
multiple kinds of expertise,

574
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,140
I think it's very
common, and there's

575
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,420
a big literature on
this in social science,

576
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,500
for social scientists
and humanists

577
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,180
to be called upon
at the end of pipe,

578
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,660
to implement a prefigured
technology or research

579
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,300
agenda in a community.

580
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,980
And we know that there are
counterintuitive effects

581
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,220
of these technologies that
reverberate when they're not

582
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,060
designed in tandem with the
people who are the intended

583
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,060
users and with the relationships
that those technologies can

584
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,980
configure.

585
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,300
So we're really
excited to partner

586
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,860
at the outset of
some research design,

587
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,220
in terms of our
collaboration within MIT,

588
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,060
to build MIT's climate-wide,
MIT-wide climate

589
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,690
paradigm of research.

590
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,930
And I think one of
the definitions,

591
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,590
in addition to community,
is frontline communities.

592
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,570
So we're talking
about people who

593
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,330
feel like threatened by climate
change or other problems,

594
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,670
environmental problems.

595
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,090
And so a lot of
these communities

596
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,367
start in a living room,
where people get together

597
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,950
because they're upset
about something,

598
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,270
they're worried about
something, and then from there.

599
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,230
So they tend to be
self-appointed communities.

600
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,890
And, and in our ethics, we want
them to come to us to ask for

601
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,390
help.

602
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,210
We're trying not to be the
parachuting social scientists

603
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,590
that go in and
extract knowledge,

604
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,017
but we're there to exchange.

605
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:55,350
And I think that's a good point.

606
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,050
I think thinking about
frontline communities,

607
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,510
certainly there's still a
lot of diversity of that.

608
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,530
And there's so many that
you can try to work with

609
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,250
and to help solve
their problems.

610
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,830
How do you pick where to start?

611
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,950
And we've heard a lot
of examples of this,

612
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,520
but there's so many.

613
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,270
And how do you think
about approaching it?

614
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,480
How do you pick the
ones that you decide

615
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
to work with in that context?

616
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,980
I mean, I would
just say in my case,

617
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,580
that was the other way around.

618
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,960
I mean, because I grew
up in this old steel mill

619
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,420
community that was
heavily polluted,

620
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,000
I actually became
an anthropologist

621
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,140
to try to make sense of
why the experience I had,

622
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
where I was growing up--

623
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,328
I went-- after all the
steel mills closed,

624
00:26:33,328 --> 00:26:35,120
and my dad was out of
work for a long time,

625
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,840
I went off to a fancy
boarding school.

626
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,800
And becoming an
anthropologist was a way

627
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,002
to try to understand
my own background.

628
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:42,960
And the relationships
with the community groups

629
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,020
I work with actually began
before I was an anthropologist.

630
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,960
So I didn't choose the place.

631
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,100
I chose MIT as a way to continue
that relationship there.

632
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,460
So that's somewhat different
than a lot of folks,

633
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,788
but that was kind
of the route in.

634
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:01,580
Any other comments?

635
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,997
Janelle, do you
have any thoughts?

636
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,940
Yeah, I mean, I think that
part of what you're hinting at,

637
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,080
Evelyn, is that you
don't have to have

638
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,800
interaction at a really large
scale to have meaningful impact.

639
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,240
And I think that's where
communities can be so important.

640
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,060
So many of our climate
mitigation or adaptation efforts

641
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,620
tend to take this state
top-down, forcing approach

642
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,590
that we need wide scale
energy transition.

643
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,140
And we do.

644
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,348
We absolutely do
need all of that.

645
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:28,140
But I think that, as
academics, and serving

646
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,420
in a bridge capacity between
the science, and the technology,

647
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,120
and the community values,
and needs, and objectives,

648
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,620
we can have a really
meaningful role working

649
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,120
with those communities to which
we already have connections,

650
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,140
or working where, locally, at a
smaller scale, that kind of work

651
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,700
can be really impactful
and meaningful, as well.

652
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,440
And I think that's
absolutely true.

653
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,620
And I think that's how we're
also very much thinking

654
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,120
about it.

655
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,820
But I think the
questions that continue

656
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,460
to be kind of front and
center is like, well,

657
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,020
since it's such a
large problem in--

658
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:06,240
Chris, as your case, it's
been part of you in some ways.

659
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,460
But as engineers, we're
trying to really take

660
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,260
advantage of our
skills, but also

661
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,290
being respectful of what
communities also want.

662
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,658
And how do we really
engage effectively?

663
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:19,950
And I think that speaks to,
Laura, your point, as well.

664
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,850
Because I think there's
a lot of well-meaning.

665
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,850
However, sometimes
the well-meaning

666
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,090
doesn't translate into how
communities kind of really

667
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,690
interpret kind of
that well-meaning.

668
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,970
And I think that's always
this ongoing challenge

669
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,610
and opportunity for us to
learn from many of you that

670
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,730
really look at these
aspects in detail.

671
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,670
Absolutely.

672
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,530
And I just might throw out
that one orientation of the lab

673
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,110
overall is, again, really
the focus on the long term,

674
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,570
so that it's not one-off
relationships like, oh, we're

675
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,970
going to work with this
community this semester.

676
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,670
And next semester, we're
going to do something else.

677
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,587
This is our long-term.

678
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:59,730
And the partnerships,
for many of us, were--

679
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,260
even mine was an unusually
long relationship.

680
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,010
But in many instances,
people were already

681
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,302
working with particular groups.

682
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:09,315
So the idea is we are in it for
the long haul with the groups

683
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,440
that we're partnering with.

684
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
And the idea is to keep
going back to those groups

685
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,820
and make sure that
it's long term.

686
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,278
So I think that's one of the
ways, a different kind of time

687
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:18,860
frame, is something it's key
to building relations of trust,

688
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,760
as you heard one of the folks
say in the video that you saw.

689
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
Kate, I'll turn to
you in terms of you

690
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,800
just mentioned a few classes
that you're teaching.

691
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,680
You talked about
this Urban Resilience

692
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,420
that you're teaming up
with architecture to teach.

693
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,200
And you also teach a class--

694
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,680
you've taught a class with
Susan Solomon on 20th century

695
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,560
environmental programs.

696
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,560
And you shared a little
bit, but I was curious.

697
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,000
What can we learn from these
efforts that would specifically

698
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,800
guide how we work today
across areas of MIT generally?

699
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,440
That's a great question.

700
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,820
These are challenging
relationships, I think,

701
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,200
across social science, and
science, and engineering.

702
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,120
Because we don't always
immediately speak

703
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,260
the same language, and we don't
always have a level of trust.

704
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,550
And so I think what's
been so great--

705
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,510
I've taught a course with
Susan Solomon in EAPS

706
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,110
now for the last four
or five years, and now

707
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,050
with architecture and art,
is that by working together--

708
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,870
and we have what--

709
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,110
the goal in mind is
students and their learning.

710
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,350
And working together, we
develop both a common vocabulary

711
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,650
and a sense of trust.

712
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,210
And then from there, we
start to do other things.

713
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,910
So Susan Solomon and I
write right op-eds together,

714
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,210
and we get involved in this,
and so on, and so forth.

715
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,350
So I think that's one of
the real values we have.

716
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,270
And thanks to
MITHIC for allowing

717
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,910
us to be able to-- in
the social sciences,

718
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,950
to start to ask the questions,
and to set the first parameters,

719
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,330
and invite others to come in.

720
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,750
I think that's really helpful.

721
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,150
Yeah, that's great.

722
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,530
And, Janelle, I have
a question for you.

723
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,150
You mentioned in your
introductory remarks

724
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,770
that you spent a lot of time
with Indigenous communities,

725
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,410
and you talked about
the opportunities.

726
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,020
But where do you see there
are still challenges and gaps

727
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,820
by which how we
really can effectively

728
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,780
engage with them, that
we can help them and work

729
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,700
with them effectively?

730
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,220
Yeah, I think, I mean,
the last few months

731
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,000
have been really challenging
with all of the federal impacts,

732
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,640
different regulatory pressures.

733
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,620
And so I think capacity
is a huge issue that

734
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,620
is-- as academic institutions,
it's really important

735
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,160
that our engagements
are not extractive,

736
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,180
that we're actually
going in and that there's

737
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,220
a mutual exchange or mutual
facilitation of benefit

738
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,200
in these exchanges.

739
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,260
And so funding is a huge
issue, trying to find--

740
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,220
we never-- when we were running
the Indigenous Environmental

741
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,820
Planning practicum
course, we actually--

742
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,540
we provide honoraria
to the communities

743
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,673
to work with our students.

744
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:51,840
And that's really important.

745
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,877
It's acknowledging the
time and the effort

746
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,460
that they're putting
into the projects

747
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,085
and what they're
bringing to the table.

748
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:59,540
And so I think that
kind of level of support

749
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,920
can't be taken for granted.

750
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,260
We've seen in the
last few months

751
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,940
where we have a more
difficult budgetary situation,

752
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,940
how that can make that
kind of work challenging.

753
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,400
And then it's also
just a capacity issue.

754
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,200
The often Indigenous
nations, you're

755
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,400
looking at smaller
groups of people

756
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,980
that are fulfilling all of
the functions of a government.

757
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,480
So any kind of
engagement with us

758
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,420
is an extra level of engagement.

759
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,913
And sometimes the
ministers or secretaries

760
00:32:25,913 --> 00:32:28,080
that we're working with in
these governments already

761
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,340
have multiple jobs.

762
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,160
And so it's kind
of that recognition

763
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,560
that any kind of
academic engagement

764
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,780
can take time and resources
away from them, as well.

765
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,260
And so I think it's
to Chris's point.

766
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,040
It's important that the
relationships be meaningful

767
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,860
to both sides.

768
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,460
They're absolutely
invaluable to our students,

769
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,320
but that we have sustained
funding and resources

770
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,580
to support these programs
where we want to build them,

771
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,360
and that they're also long term.

772
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,420
I think some of our most
successful projects,

773
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,060
like with Shinnecock
Indian Nation,

774
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,660
we've done multiple projects
over and over again,

775
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,280
and they develop really
meaningful relationships

776
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,180
with our students.

777
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,335
Our students have an
appreciation for the communities

778
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:07,210
they're working with.

779
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,670
And then the projects
themselves can actually

780
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,990
take work that's somewhat
restricted by being

781
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,670
in a one-semester context
and expand it over time.

782
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,150
So that they can do, actually,
really deep and meaningful work

783
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:19,750
for these--

784
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,630
or with these communities.

785
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,190
Well, thank you for that.

786
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,230
Laura, I'm very excited
about MITHIC in general

787
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,787
and the opportunities
for cross-pollination

788
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:33,870
with what we're trying to
achieve with the Climate

789
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,370
Project.

790
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,470
You spoke to this a little bit
in your introductory remarks,

791
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,670
as well.

792
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,190
And your research really
has included an examination

793
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,670
of the challenges faced by
these interdisciplinary teams

794
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,510
and seeking these collaborative
approaches to developing

795
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,810
these climate solutions.

796
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,230
And I was wondering if you
could dig in a little bit more,

797
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,390
because I think this is
really the crux of it

798
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,790
all as we're trying to think
about how do we really engage

799
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,060
across the ecosystem to
really move the needle in some

800
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,500
of these solutions in impacting
and helping communities.

801
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,159
Absolutely.

802
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,951
Thank you for that.

803
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:13,620
I think that is the most
exciting and potentially

804
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,500
generative challenge.

805
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,699
When we crack that is
an MIT hard problem.

806
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,420
My colleagues have
spoken to some

807
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,020
of the collaborative
environments

808
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,139
that they've been involved
in, in terms of collaborating

809
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,120
internally to MIT.

810
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,495
And I'm hearing
a lot of emphasis

811
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:31,340
on trust building,
capacity building,

812
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,820
and working together to
identify some shared language.

813
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,820
And these are all
excellent tools for us

814
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,600
in terms of individual
collaborations.

815
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,260
And I also want to point out
some what's under the hood

816
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,219
a little bit in
these challenges.

817
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:50,422
So we are often presumed, in
social science and humanities,

818
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,880
to have different
objects of study.

819
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,920
And that can be true.

820
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,780
But as we've heard from
all these wonderful videos,

821
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,940
we have a lot of
shared interests

822
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,310
in terms of how to address
climate as an object of study.

823
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,310
So we may study
people in communities,

824
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:09,090
but folks in engineering
study efficiency,

825
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,850
and mechanical processes,
and technical innovation,

826
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,610
and all these things that are
exciting and at the forefront

827
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,690
of climate work.

828
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,890
But there really is a gap
in research investment,

829
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,970
in terms of social
science, of climate change.

830
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,930
So only less than 0.25%
of research funding

831
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,430
goes to the social science
of climate mitigation.

832
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,170
So that's a really exciting
opportunity for us.

833
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,210
And integrating across these
expertise-- areas of expertise

834
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,970
is quite difficult. We need to
learn how to get comfortable

835
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:49,610
with indeterminacy, with
speaking in different paradigms,

836
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,690
and with having different
kinds of empirical toolkits.

837
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,650
I think our empirical
toolkits are often

838
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,840
not legible to one another.

839
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,640
And we also really
need to figure out

840
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,080
how to think differently, and
thinking in terms of impact

841
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,520
differently, I think we've
heard a little bit of--

842
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
I'd love to continue
this conversation

843
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,860
because impact is such a--

844
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,000
it's a watchword, and
it's so motivating.

845
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,780
And I'm going to oversimplify
engineering a little bit,

846
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,420
I realize.

847
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
But when engineers
think about impacts,

848
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,120
they're thinking
about optimizing

849
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,960
within a particular technology
or a particular technical

850
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,640
process, and optimizing
within the boundaries

851
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,540
of a specific condition.

852
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,600
But as we know from a lot
of research in engineering,

853
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,280
as well as in social
sciences, when

854
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,560
you expand that area of
analysis, impacts in one area

855
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,060
have counterintuitive
effects at larger scales,

856
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,540
at longer scales, not just
in other technical arenas,

857
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,540
but also for social
relationships,

858
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,540
for communities, for receiving
communities of pollution,

859
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,800
and things like this.

860
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,580
So I think this is a
really powerful opportunity

861
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,220
we have to, at MIT, situate
technical innovation

862
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,540
within its
sociotechnical context.

863
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,820
And so I'm really excited
to be involved in that.

864
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,340
And I think the theme
here is a lot of learnings

865
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,860
across disciplines
for us to really

866
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,660
be able to really appreciate
all these different nuances

867
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,720
and opportunities.

868
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,520
I'm starting to realize,
I'm out of time.

869
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,820
So I'm sorry.

870
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,700
We do have time for questions.

871
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,460

872
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,690
Please, Kurt.

873
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,100

874
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,820
Thanks.

875
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,195
Laura, you actually started
to get into this a little bit

876
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,480
in your last response.

877
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm curious, while across
all of these great projects,

878
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,660
you're investing in the
heterogeneous nature

879
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,140
of each community, what kinds
of interesting entanglements,

880
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,880
especially beneficial or
particularly interesting ones,

881
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,450
might be coming up because
you're gathering all

882
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,140
of these projects together
under the Living Climate Futures

883
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,640
umbrella?

884
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,270

885
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,850
Yeah, and if there's folks--
where did [INAUDIBLE] go?

886
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,410
Amah might have
thoughts on this.

887
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,123
Just to throw
something, if nothing

888
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,790
comes to mind quickly
for somebody else,

889
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,238
I was just thinking we
actually did a symposium.

890
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:16,530
This is actually where the
idea for this lab came from,

891
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,530
was a symposium we
had back in 2022.

892
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,210
And it brought together
different environmental justice

893
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,410
groups, different urban
farmers, Indigenous groups

894
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,910
from different parts
of the country.

895
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,030
And they all got together.

896
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,410
And there was one
moment where we

897
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:34,690
had-- there were these
young teenagers of color

898
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,570
from a high school in
Southeast Chicago who

899
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,930
were dealing with all these
kinds of toxicity issues.

900
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,170
And they got into
conversation in the audience

901
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,170
with some of the leaders
of the Lummi Nation

902
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,450
from the Pacific Northwest.

903
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,070
And one of the leaders of
the illumination, Jay Julius,

904
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,480
said to the student--
you know, I dreamed you,

905
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,400
and had all this amazing--

906
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,340
and those teenagers were
just like, oh my God.

907
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,360
They were just so amazed
by this kind of connection

908
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,022
across groups.

909
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:06,480
And so there was
conversations that

910
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,118
were happening across
different kinds of groups,

911
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:11,160
very different kinds of
groups in different parts

912
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,642
of the country that
kind of sparked

913
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,100
whole other kinds
of relationships.

914
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,340
Some of those folks are still
in conversation with each other,

915
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,967
just a generativity of bringing
these different stuff together.

916
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,300
And so there's something, in
some ways, that's imposing,

917
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,967
we kind of thought
of it as a happening.

918
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:25,400
You bring these people
together, and it

919
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
was about putting
them into conversation

920
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,820
and seeing what
comes out of that.

921
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,280
And that was just
really super exciting.

922
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
I don't know if others
in the group, in the room

923
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,460
have thoughts on this.

924
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,192
But anyway.

925
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:38,120
You have a question?

926
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,840
I have a question
that goes crossing

927
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,620
between the Living Climate
Futures and the Climate Project.

928
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,560
Because it seems
as though impact

929
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,680
might mean something
very different

930
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,560
between the two projects.

931
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,710
And would anyone do-- does
anyone perceive that and want

932
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,690
to comment on it?

933
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,390

934
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,390
I'll start, if you
might, if it's OK.

935
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,710
I actually think there's--

936
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,950
actually, I think they're
the same, ultimately,

937
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,130
at the end of the day.

938
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,990
And the Climate
Project is very much

939
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,590
focused on building wellbeing.

940
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,710
And that means both human
wellbeing and planetary health.

941
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,430
And I think that
impacts on communities,

942
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,190
and how we want to
think about how do we

943
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,390
build, empower communities
so that they can have

944
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,690
these lives that are
sustainable, resilient,

945
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,190
and prosperous, I
think it's synergistic.

946
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,390
And so it's not just about
say, CO2 abated from--

947
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,970
that's a very
technological perspective.

948
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,450
It's also about jobs.

949
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,530
It's about job creation.

950
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,630
It's about bolstering
local economies.

951
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,630
There's a lot of this, I think,
that is hopefully resonant.

952
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:51,060
Welcome your thoughts
from this team.

953
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,540
I think this is such an
important conversation

954
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,300
for us to continue to have.

955
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,180
I think when we crack that MIT
hard problem of impact that

956
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:09,140
is locally situated, and
desirable, and climate

957
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,980
solutions that are not just
durable in the long term,

958
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:17,220
in terms of planetary health,
but also welcomed and integrated

959
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,380
into the prosperity
of local communities.

960
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,740
And being invited
into that process,

961
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,180
we will generate some
really cool solutions.

962
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,100
Yeah.

963
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,600
OK.

964
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,320
We have a flashing
red light here,

965
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,120
which makes me think
that we're out of time.

966
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,170
Let's thank our
panel one more time.

967
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,260
[APPLAUSE]

968
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,500
Thank you.

969
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,080
Thank you.

970
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,180

971
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,580
You can stay all the way.

972
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,320
That's the end of our
programming for today.

973
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,040
I just want to thank, one more
time, all of our presenters

974
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,600
and all of our moderators for
the wonderful panels today.

975
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,260
If you're--

976
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,044
[APPLAUSE]

977
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:04,840

978
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,400
So to produce an event like
this requires a lot help

979
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,940
from a lot of different people.

980
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,455
And because we are a
human-centered entity,

981
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:16,580
I'm going to name them all.

982
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,480
So I'd like to thank a lot
of people who have helped out

983
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,040
either today, volunteering,
or in the lead-up to today

984
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,480
in terms of the planning.

985
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,680
So a big thanks to Tia
Griglio, Michael Brindley,

986
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,280
Liam McDonnell, Megan
Hinkley, Anne-Marie Michael,

987
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,320
Handley Valentine, Jennifer
Guarino, Maeve Downey,

988
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,160
MF Geddes, Jana Green, Carly
Sol, Benjamin Daniel, John Van,

989
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:49,030
Britta Bell, Rosie
Dicostanzo, Liz Kazakh, sorry.

990
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,130
And then the lovely people from
MIT AV and Video Productions.

991
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,810
Thank you to all of these.

992
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,128
[APPLAUSE]

993
00:42:58,128 --> 00:43:02,870

994
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,310
And the biggest thank
you goes to our MIT team.

995
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,910
This is Jen Altan.

996
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,550
I think you want
to take up a bow.

997
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,600
And Elena Nosiglia.

998
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,958
[APPLAUSE]

999
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:18,310

1000
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,950
I mean, we're very fortunate
to have Institute support

1001
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,930
for MITHIC and such amazing
faculty producing this work.

1002
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,510
But we're also very fortunate to
have a team like Jen and Elena

1003
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,475
supporting everything
we're doing.

1004
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,850
I have some closing words,
but I'm not going to say them.

1005
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,310
I think instead, we're going
to go down to the sixth floor

1006
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,210
and have a reception.

1007
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,627
Because I think
community building

1008
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:38,850
is a large part of MITHIC.

1009
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,562
So let's go talk
and build community.

1010
00:43:40,562 --> 00:43:41,270
Thanks, everyone.

1011
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,620
[APPLAUSE]

1012
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,000
