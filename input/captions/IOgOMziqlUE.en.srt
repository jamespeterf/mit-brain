Valerie coach um I'm in Denver Colorado

108
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,639
moved here after um I finished up the

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,080
full-time program I was class of uh 22 I

110
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,520
was an Army intelligence officer before

111
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
I was in for five years active duty

112
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,440
stationed at JBLM my full-time and then

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,199
I went into the reserve for a little bit

114
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,639
at Sloan so happy to talk about that as

115
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,600
well uh I stopped doing it though so I

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,479
might have a different perspective um

117
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,560
than Chris but um I interned at McKenzie

118
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,440
uh during my summer and then I went back

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,479
full-time I've been there now close to

120
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,400
two years um but I'm doing something a

121
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,280
little different I'm on a fellowship

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,360
with McKenzie um I'm working with a

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,960
nonprofit so it's a certainly a

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,240
different um different experience so

125
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,280
happy to chat about all of that awesome

126
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,240
yeah thank you all for the introductions

127
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
I know you guys bring a ton of wealth

128
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,080
and knowledge and good background back

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,919
here I think one of the first questions

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I kind of wanted to jump into here

131
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,000
is the transition right you know we all

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,639
were in the military and we left so I I

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,319
I wanted to start with a volunteer who

134
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,759
maybe wants to talk about what was the

135
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,319
most difficult part of transitioning

136
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,680
from you know being in the military to

137
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,800
full-time student life and how can

138
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,240
others in the seat be the most

139
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,759
successful I'll jump in um I was

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,240
reflecting a lot about this um in light

141
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,520
of this panel and I I think back to that

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,000
fall when I started so I think similar

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,840
to Mike my etss date from active duty

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,800
was the first day of class at Sloan so

145
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,800
it was just jumping right in and I think

146
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,160
one thing that was challenging is I

147
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,280
didn't really have time to reflect and

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,080
and think about um what I wanted to do

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,919
uh when I got to school and so um that

150
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
was something that was a little bit

151
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,520
challenging but one thing that was

152
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,199
unexpected is how much time you have if

153
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,919
you structure it sort of correctly I

154
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,720
think coming from working full-time you

155
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
know you're really busy obviously

156
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,759
military is really demanding and I think

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,520
I was surprised by the amount of free

158
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,120
time I had and what's so exciting about

159
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,759
that is you can fill it with too much

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,840
stuff I mean you're G to have so many

161
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,599
opportunities and options and so I think

162
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,280
it's just important to be uh prepared

163
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,479
for the amount of um um options and then

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,039
just be really intentional about how you

165
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
want to fill your

166
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,360
time yeah I know

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,800
absolutely anyone else want to jump in

168
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,160
there yeah I'll just say real quick um I

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,280
think it was a little bit different for

170
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,280
me I I'm married to have three kids and

171
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,720
um obviously I think the challenging

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,680
part is is you're making this transition

173
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,039
from a

174
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,039
lifestyle um that You' that you've known

175
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:37,120
for a very very long time coming up to a

176
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:39,599
new city um and and trying to balance in

177
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,599
my case I didn't have a lot of free time

178
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,879
um because because of my family

179
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:49,199
commitments so certainly just trying to

180
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,960
figure out how to to balance that um and

181
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,919
and knowing that it wasn't just me going

182
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,400
through a transition um it was my family

183
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,720
as well um I think that was probably the

184
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:05,360
most the challenging thing um you know

185
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
for for me and and and the family alike

186
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,639
um yeah we but it can be done and it's

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,319
just a matter of just expectation

188
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,479
management and uh you know getting into

189
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,639
a routine um you know we we happen to

190
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,560
live an hour an hour away from campus so

191
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,720
I was commuting every day um not

192
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,479
something I would necessarily recommend

193
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,519
but but it it it kind of allowed us to

194
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,800
to we we bought a house when we moved up

195
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,519
here we knew we were going to stay um

196
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,959
allowed us to be kind of out away from

197
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,360
everything um which which was important

198
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,200
to the family but it was at the same

199
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,040
time meant that um I was doing a lot of

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
commuting and pulling some really long

201
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,080
hours so just just trying to figure out

202
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,440
how to manage that um and and be present

203
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,600
for both um I think was the most

204
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,440
challenging aspect of

205
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
it no def

206
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,839
the

207
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,120
uh so they definitely deserve way way

208
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,279
more credit than they get um anyone else

209
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,839
Andrew Justin Chris you guys wantan

210
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,839
to talk about your

211
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,279
transition uh similar to Valerie's point

212
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,920
I think for me one of the things I found

213
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,720
hardest was um feeling you know there's

214
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,120
the obvious imposter syndrome of all

215
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,920
these people who have like come from

216
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,079
various business I mean even Chris at

217
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,240
least had like deoe before uh you know

218
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,720
but you feel very behind like oh I don't

219
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,120
know I haven't done this math

220
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,600
calculation I don't know anything about

221
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,399
economics I don't know this I don't know

222
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,760
that or I don't know these people or

223
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,680
these types of people um and so you feel

224
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,920
like you need to catch up and at least I

225
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
know I did like definitely signed up for

226
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,040
way too many things and just like

227
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,640
overstretched myself um uh which had to

228
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,320
slow down very much my second year CU my

229
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,760
wife and I had a kid over summer uh in

230
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,760
between my two years so uh that was

231
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,640
definitely um something that was

232
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
challenging for me was just trying to

233
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,079
overcome that feeling and and you'll

234
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,640
find you know especially as you kind of

235
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,800
get towards the end that everyone kind

236
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,320
of feels that way no matter where they

237
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,279
come from so uh you know don't feel like

238
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,279
you're the only one because you

239
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,560
def yeah well if if I I mean I kind of

240
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,440
had the deoe as Justin mentioned I kind

241
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,279
of had the deot experience beforehand so

242
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I kind of knew what I was getting into a

243
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,519
little bit um I would say from my

244
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,680
perspective if I was like thinking about

245
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,920
the transition it would be like okay

246
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,680
what does it mean to be an NBA but also

247
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,839
choose to be a reservice at the same

248
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,560
time uh and I I think I think that was

249
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
probably one of the hardest transitions

250
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,800
because I think you know wanting to be

251
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
an active participant making sure I'm

252
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,399
still doing what I need to get done to

253
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
help out my soldiers was really

254
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,959
important to me it's something I valued

255
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,920
I mean I actually went away uh to

256
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,920
Germany for a few weeks and this was

257
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,480
like right as the Ukraine right before

258
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,880
Ukraine was kicking off so it was a it

259
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,279
was a very different time so um it it

260
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,160
was tough but I was able to prioritize

261
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,079
the military and school and my family uh

262
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,240
not well sometimes but I I tried to do

263
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,240
my

264
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,600
best yeah know that's that's great uh

265
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:34,040
Andrew you wanna finish it off here it

266
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,040
was great I wish I could go back I loved

267
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,240
it no no I I love it um okay Andrew we

268
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,120
we'll start with you for here you know

269
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,959
when you're when you're looking at all

270
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,040
these different schools you know

271
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,600
obviously there's a ton of incredible

272
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,360
programs out there just curious you know

273
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,639
on your thought process on how you ended

274
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
up at Sloan and you know obviously

275
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,399
you're the one here who did the uh LGL

276
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,959
program as well

277
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,120
yeah

278
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,880
um for me it came down to fit and that's

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:12,399
a kind of mushy thing to say like what

280
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,959
what is fit to me fit looking backwards

281
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,320
means that you got to spend two years

282
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:19,959
with these people schools have different

283
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,800
cultures um you should want to go enjoy

284
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:24,240
those two years with those people so uh

285
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,880
talking them ahead of time I think for

286
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,160
me I landed on lgo because I really did

287
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,720
want that engineering degree I wanted to

288
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,160
go spend some time studying engineering

289
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,920
I wanted to dig deep into Ai and

290
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
Robotics uh I got the chance to do that

291
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,320
and the fit part of that too is that

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,399
there were a bunch of other people who

293
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,240
wanted to do that as well that I get to

294
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,800
spend my time with um you'll probably

295
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,240
hear from everybody here in one way or

296
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,000
another that you there's way more

297
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,040
commitments than you have time for

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,560
and the the the the cool part of the lgo

299
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,279
group is that those are people who have

300
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,959
decided they're going to spend a decent

301
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,720
chunk of that time doing doing

302
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:06,680
engineering work um I liked that it made

303
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,680
it a fun place to spend two

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,519
years yeah know the I feel like the LG

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,040
cohort definitely has a very busy

306
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,199
experience for sure but man they you

307
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,760
know I'm not jealous of them uh yeah

308
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:26,680
anyone else would like to kind of talk

309
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,680
about why they ch slan

310
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,040
yeah I'll I'll go ahead and um you know

311
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:40,040
specifically for me you know the the the

312
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,600
appeal was the Sloan fellows program um

313
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,160
you know I joined the Navy when I was 19

314
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,959
I didn't go to college beforehand I did

315
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,759
my undergrad online while I was um while

316
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,079
I was working as a

317
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,120
seal which which what really wasn't a

318
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,279
fun thing to do and I knew that I wanted

319
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,560
the full-time experience and uh really

320
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,800
what this uh offered me there's really

321
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,279
nothing like it out there uh was an

322
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,360
opportunity to to study at a top MBA

323
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,000
program and to do the full-time

324
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,160
experience um without being out of the

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,199
workforce for two years um part of that

326
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,360
is just the opportunity cost with

327
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,560
associated with having a family needing

328
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,480
to you know provide for them but also

329
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,399
you know I'm also in in the in the

330
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,399
program already in my 40s and I'm ready

331
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,320
to get out and and and and start a new

332
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,639
career so uh for me you know it was um

333
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,639
really a

334
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,320
no-brainer no yeah that's that's

335
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,759
awesome uh yeah to Andrew's point for me

336
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
it was definitely fit I realized in my

337
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,880
intro I didn't even tell you guys what I

338
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,240
did in the n in the military but I was

339
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,160
in the uh Navy for eight years I did uh

340
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,759
was a Navy nuclear surface Ware officer

341
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,320
so um for me I wanted to leverage you

342
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,959
know I was a math major undergrad uh did

343
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,680
the new filler thing but uh I wasn't

344
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:06,079
sure that engineering was something I

345
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,759
actually wanted to do like forever um

346
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,639
and so but the MIT MBA you know had kind

347
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,600
of the balance of I would even say a

348
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,720
balance because it's not even

349
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,720
necessarily like a curriculum thing but

350
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,279
it's more of like the people who go to

351
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,800
MIT typically have some sort of

352
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,680
association with being technically

353
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,160
profession I mean it's literally in the

354
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,160
name and so for me that was like

355
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,440
something important um to kind of like

356
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,720
focus on and and and be able to use

357
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,759
moving forward even if I didn't do the

358
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,600
lgo program um also even know from

359
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,399
Montana I'm a huge post of Celtics fan

360
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,759
so that was like a second second huge

361
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,759
point for

362
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,399
me yeah that's

363
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,959
great um yeah I'll say for me I think it

364
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,399
came down to three things the first was

365
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,160
I was really interested in the lgo

366
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,160
program totally candidly I didn't get in

367
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,880
and while I was bummed by that what's

368
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,440
really neat about Sloan is you can still

369
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,240
take a lot of classes from other um

370
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,720
disciplines and so I was still able to

371
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,319
take a lot of the engineering classes

372
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,399
that I was really interested in even

373
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:16,440
though I wasn't in the lgo program so

374
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,519
that was um that was huge for me and

375
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,519
that was really that that really swayed

376
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,440
my decision I think my second Point here

377
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,880
is just I had a very specific interest

378
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,040
um I did a lot of supply chain and

379
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,399
humanitarian assistance in the army and

380
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,000
that's something that Sloan actually and

381
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,680
MIT generally they have an ecosystem

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,120
that does a lot of research and support

383
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,480
into that so after hearing that I was

384
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,519
like wow this really just seems like a

385
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,120
natural fit and then I think third to

386
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,240
just cap it off and Echo what everyone

387
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,839
says the conversations that I was having

388
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,639
with people just it felt like this was

389
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,279
going to be a place where I could Thrive

390
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,040
like it sounded like it was going to be

391
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,800
challenging but you form really strong

392
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,040
connections and I think I would just

393
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,079
suggest maybe don't overthink it and

394
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,720
just go with what feels like like where

395
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,880
do you think you're going to fit in and

396
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,360
and where do you think you're going to

397
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,319
be able to be the most successful and

398
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,640
get the most

399
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,679
support no yeah Valle that's that's such

400
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,000
a good point too and I think that's the

401
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,160
one thing that I didn't know coming into

402
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,120
MIT is that you could actually take

403
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,720
courses at other you know programs and

404
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm I'm currently in a course to AI

405
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,760
machine learning for engineering design

406
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,919
getting my ass kicked next to phds and

407
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,919
graduate students but you know it's it's

408
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,720
it's been really a amazing to be in the

409
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
classroom as these amazing people and

410
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,360
learn so definitely if anyone needs to

411
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,440
challenge thems it's definitely one way

412
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,160
to do it and then uh Chris you wanna

413
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,880
wrap us up here yeah yeah I'll do my

414
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,640
best to close out and I I'll lay out my

415
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,360
three reasons um I think for me one was

416
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,880
the the technical aspects I kind of came

417
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,520
in knowing that I wanted to make the

418
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,559
switch to product management so it kind

419
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,760
of made me think about okay what schools

420
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,400
to me based on my back background being

421
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,960
a liberal arts major beforehand and

422
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,240
having some you know military military

423
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,840
experiences would best position me to

424
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,919
get a role in and in product dur in Tech

425
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,840
and Sloan was like at the top of the

426
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,559
list um I also I think I also had Square

427
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,039
this with saying like if you're applying

428
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,200
to Sloan you're probably applying to

429
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,080
more than one school and if you get into

430
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,880
Sloan you're probably gonna get into

431
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,240
more than one of the school so it CES

432
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,640
down to a choice right um and the choice

433
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,880
for me was made

434
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,039
immediately after uh I did uh admitted

435
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,200
students weekend where I stayed with the

436
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,000
president of the Vets Club who actually

437
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,440
was my friend from

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,640
Roc um who I met when I was deployed in

439
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,320
Iraq and he's like apply and it just it

440
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,200
felt like the right place to be um and

441
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,440
so that was one of the big reasons for

442
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:58,039
me and um yeah I mean I just I can't

443
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,720
speak highly enough about the quality

444
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,520
and the the the the Brilliance that

445
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,640
people bring to MIT and it's just it it

446
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,640
was astounding so that again of seed the

447
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,440
deal for

448
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,360
me oh yeah Chris it's definitely echoing

449
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
all that you said and you know I'm I'm

450
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,000
definitely gonna miss this you know

451
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,679
place next year um and then Chris I I'll

452
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,280
come back to you on like and you kind of

453
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,840
alluded to the community at slan but you

454
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,159
know if you had to describe that in a

455
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,360
sentence and then during your time there

456
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,000
like how did you get plugged in you know

457
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,400
into that Community you know whether

458
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,480
that was through clubs or different

459
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,360
ORS yeah yeah um I think the this the

460
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,559
classic saying about SLO SLO helping

461
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,039
slon um so it is very common and I don't

462
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:52,159
know almost expected when I went into my

463
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:55,280
Microsoft interview for this my summer

464
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,960
internship I found out everyone every we

465
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,240
all know where we're interviewing and I

466
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,640
just gave the questions to the next

467
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,440
person that I just so they know hey this

468
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,880
is what they've been asking so just kind

469
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,799
of lean in on some of these things from

470
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,320
your experiences and that's normal to me

471
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,679
and that that was completely fine so

472
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,799
it's it's not a competitive environment

473
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,520
at all and that's what I really enjoyed

474
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:19,120
it was mostly about helping each other

475
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,200
um but things that I got involved in um

476
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,720
one of the things that I wanted to

477
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,440
prioritize was building black

478
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,880
relationships um at sloom so I decided

479
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,320
to become um the treasurer for the black

480
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,440
business Students Association and that

481
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,840
was important to me uh to give back to

482
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,880
the black community not just uh for in

483
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,240
at Sloan but for the Institute because

484
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,120
we all work together um to create our

485
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,039
the black community uh which um is which

486
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,320
was growing uh which was fantastic to be

487
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,320
a part

488
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,000
of that's

489
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,600
awesome Justin you want you w to jump in

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,600
here as one of the

491
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
of the Vets Club yeah um I was actually

492
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,200
going to be part of my answer so what

493
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,480
are the uh wait was there a first part

494
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,039
of the question as well that I that I

495
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,520
missed involvement no yeah it was mainly

496
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,720
just like you know in a sentence if you

497
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,000
could kind of describe the community at

498
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,159
Sloan oh yeah Chris nailed it so I don't

499
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,760
need to expand on that

500
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,720
um uh yeah and then in terms of things I

501
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,000
got involved in my first year I did the

502
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,360
Sports analytics conference uh like

503
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,919
actually worked on it second year I

504
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,600
volunteered recommend the ladder

505
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,840
um and then one of the things I did not

506
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,120
expect to get as involved in uh and as

507
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,279
Will William just mentioned is the vet

508
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,919
club uh I was not expecting to be as

509
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,679
like involved in that uh you know one of

510
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,559
the things I think a lot of veterans do

511
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,240
and some and some do uh and it's totally

512
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,360
fine is they go to this you know they go

513
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,720
to this new this a new chapter of your

514
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,840
life and you know you may want to keep

515
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,520
as close Ties on you know this past

516
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,600
chapter you're now leaving um but I

517
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,159
found the you know that that Community

518
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,559
was even more uh you know I connected

519
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,120
with them so much better overall right

520
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,360
than some of your classmates not that

521
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,640
any of those other connections are bad

522
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,360
it's just it's so much easier and fluid

523
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,880
to connect with other vets because you

524
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,120
have similar backgrounds or you know um

525
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
you know you might be looking into

526
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,039
similar things and you just have so many

527
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,080
other things in common with them uh and

528
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,559
so yeah that was probably for me

529
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,799
ended up becoming like one of the most

530
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,440
important groups for me and yeah

531
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,799
obviously I became a co-president my

532
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,760
second year so uh obviously enjoyed it

533
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,320
enough um but yeah that was probably the

534
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,240
biggest one and then yeah joining like I

535
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,400
joined a couple hackathons that's where

536
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,400
you really start to see like the true

537
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,640
genius of a lot of your classmates I

538
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,360
think I just realize like oh yeah the

539
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,120
guy can actually use Excel out a mouse

540
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,400
like it's pretty crazy uh stuff like

541
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,120
that um you know that I thought was

542
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,960
really really uh kind of

543
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,360
rewarding yeah I know for sure and then

544
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,360
Justin you want uh you know you

545
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,159

attend yeah Justin thanks for sharing

567
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
and and then Mike you want to kind of

568
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,320
you know I'd love to hear kind of your

569
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,080
experience you know being being a slone

570
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:01,039
fellow and because kind of

571
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,799
how yeah yeah absolutely um you know the

572
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:07,520
community is is really diverse um at

573
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:10,919
Sloan um for example the the snba

574
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,919
program uh itself is is 75%

575
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,919
International um so having been in the

576
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,400
military for as long as I have been and

577
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,720
having you know I've had the opportunity

578
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,760
to work with teams and and folks from

579
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,240
all over the world um you know I really

580
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,640
appreciated that um but but at the same

581
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,600
time it's really a small community um

582
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,440
and and I think it was mentioned before

583
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,520
or it was mentioned about the impostor

584
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,760
syndrome um I I I think you know it's

585
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,919
obviously in full force it's MIT no one

586
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,640
thinks they're smart enough to be there

587
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,880
uh including myself but I think that's

588
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,559
what really connects us all um in some

589
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,760
ways it kind of level sets um us and

590
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,240
when we all realize that um you know I

591
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,840
people open up and become more

592
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,120
vulnerable and and that's where the real

593
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,080
relationships are built and um so yeah

594
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,240
if you know the community itself's just

595
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,799
very tight very um you know um very

596
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
diverse and appreciative of of people

597
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,559
with different perspectives and

598
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,640
backgrounds even Within Myself you know

599
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,440
myself being you know uh or or the the

600
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,720
veterans in general you know you have

601
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,600
you have look at the panel here we have

602
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,679
like we come from all walks of life you

603
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,240
know in the military and so it's not

604
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,240
just you know different Moss's it's it's

605
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,640
officers it's enlisted um it really you

606
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,320
know it's really representative of of

607
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,000
more um during my time um I'll kind of

608
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,279
go back to what I was saying before you

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,760
know the one-year program is fantastic

610
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:47,720
it's um it's not easy trying to cram uh

611
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:52,000
two years worth of credits into one year

612
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,120
um and and again being where I lived um

613
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,880
it it's one of my biggest

614
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,360
regrets is not being more involved I was

615
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
in the entrepreneurship throughout

616
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,039
acquisition club which I thought was

617
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,360
really great um I had involvement with

618
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,880
the veterans Club as well um but I I

619
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,159
would say that you know one of my

620
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,840
biggest regrets was not getting more

621
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,760
involved on thing in things on campus I

622
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,480
was I was almost taking my coursework

623
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,120
too seriously and um you know I I was I

624
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,360
was focused on trying to get to school

625
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,039
you know before anybody else because I

626
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,919
out of necessity had to beat traffic and

627
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,640
you know I would I had my routine and

628
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,000
and before I knew it uh the year was

629
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,360
over so um you know I I was involved in

630
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,039
things but but certainly if I could

631
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,000
offer anybody advice it would be to to

632
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,679
Really you know take advantage of of all

633
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,039
the things that are on campus I mean the

634
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,840
cours work's important but but there's

635
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,240
so many more things and so you know that

636
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,880
you can take advantage of and that you

637
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,120
should take advantage of um that you

638
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,320
don't want to let that pass you

639
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,720
by no definitely thanks Mike for that

640
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,080
and then hey Andrew can you talk about

641
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,399
you know the I feel like the lgo's have

642
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,080
a have a community within the you know

643
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:13,399
the or can you kind of like talk about

644
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,279
that a little bit sure yeah so to

645
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,120
squeeze uh the engineering degree credit

646
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,120
requirements in with the MBA credit

647
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:24,120
requirements over two years uh we start

648
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,399
our uh class early so we come in there

649
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,799
may uh and then we have all of the first

650
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,399
summer

651
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,840
uh doing what we call the lgo core a

652
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,159
bunch of operations engineering Focus

653
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,520
classes the fall We join the rest of the

654
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,799
slown community uh after getting our

655
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,519
butts kicked all summer you know nice

656
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,519
good military kind of team uh and then

657
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,600
we have a couple of uh trips out to

658
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,039
different manufacturing operation sites

659
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
uh during the program as well as an

660
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,440
internship and a thesis that um we all

661
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:01,640
kind of uh not collaborate on our thesis

662
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,080
but be doing at the same time so that

663
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
builds that Community inside the

664
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,799
community because you get to know these

665
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,559
people first and uh then you get to go

666
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,960
Branch out and meet people who are

667
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,799
working on a lot of other things and

668
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,000
from a lot of different backgrounds um

669
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,519
and it's the best of both worlds I loved

670
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,840
it

671
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,519
um you also get a chance to go and meet

672
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,120
the engineering community and go take

673
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:28,240
classes with folks in The Graduate

674
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,919
School of Engineering which is uh a

675
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,960
chance to learn a lot a chance to dip

676
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,000
your feet in a bunch of different things

677
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,039
and a chance every now and then to watch

678
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,440
like a 17-year-old ASA test that you

679
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,960
struggle to get a 60 on which you know

680
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,519
kudos to them because they're probably

681
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,840
gonna you know cure cancer and I I I

682
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,120
want them to be

683
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,919
challenged no yeah definitely that's

684
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,919
that's awesome and then

685
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,960
Valerie yeah I so I was doing the um

686
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
stainability

687
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,320
certificate so I was pretty involved

688
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,919
with some of the sustainable clubs um

689
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,399
one comes to mind we do a pretty pretty

690
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,559
big sustainability Summit every year so

691
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,039
I was pretty involved with that I also

692
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,720
mentioned earlier that one of the

693
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,360
reasons I was interested in Sloan was

694
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,279
because of um sort of

695
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,120
humanitarian um Logistics and supply

696
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,760
chain and there is a club at Sloan the

697
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,159
Sloan entrepreneurs for International

698
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,080
Development so that was really

699
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,720
fascinating I got to work um

700
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,960
unfortunately it was during Co otherwise

701
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,360
I think we would have been able to

702
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,519
travel but that um gave me a ton of

703
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,320
exposure to um entrepreneurs overseas

704
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,559
and in a completely different context

705
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,559
from which um I was familiar um but

706
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,640
honestly one of the ones one of the

707
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,760
experiences I look back most fondly on

708
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,080
is I'm a big skier and we have a really

709
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,519
big ski club we go on a lot of trips um

710
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,679
and I think uh that that's one of my

711
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,760
favorite memories that and um as sort of

712
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,960
Will and Justin I was also so involved

713
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,159
pretty involved with the Vets Community

714
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,000
um I I think it's really important to

715
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,039
have a lot of um more female

716
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,159
representation in um female veteran

717
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:13,640
representation so I spent a lot of time

718
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,320
um sort of like mentoring and reviewing

719
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,360
um in assisting with admissions for the

720
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,559
Vets Club um but yes overall you're the

721
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,519
issue is you're gonna have too many

722
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,640
things to get involved in um so like I

723
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:29,240
said good luck figuring out what to

724
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:32,720
do no yeah that's feel like

725
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,600
the if you can figure out how to say no

726
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,679
quicker that's kind of the you know the

727
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,200
magic there

728
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,559
um Valerie I have a question uh here for

729
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,399
you and you obvious for the rest of the

730
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,919
group as well I

731
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,480
think everyone a lot of people who apply

732
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,279
to NBA programs you know like Mike

733
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,360
mentioned you know we have impostor

734
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,760
syndrome but I think sometimes as

735
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,720
veterans we are like oh man like we

736
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,639
didn't come from a business background

737
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,080
like we not a consultant or or like a

738
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,039
banker and sometimes maybe we feel even

739
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,000
more inadequate compared to our

740
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,240
classmates so would love to hear your

741
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,840
your experiences on how you know the

742
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,000
veteran and military background how they

743
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,360
help shape discussions and and decisions

744
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,320
you know whether that's in group

745
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,840
projects or case studies

746
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,679
Etc yeah know it's a great

747
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,799
question you know I think the value that

748
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,639
a lot of veterans bring is leadership

749
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,720
experience and I think it's one thing to

750
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:33,039
keep in mind as you know as applicants

751
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,919
you're thinking about crafting your

752
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,440
narrative that something that is really

753
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,519
distinctive about military applicants is

754
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,519
the exposure and the experience that you

755
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,360
have managing teams and that's something

756
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,000
that your classmates will really value

757
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,720
as well because a lot of them have come

758
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,200
from very diverse backgrounds but not

759
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,799
many of them have led organizations at

760
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,480
sort of the level and the positions that

761
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:58,159
you all will have so while it does feel

762
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,600
like often how are you here and are you

763
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,080
doing and what can you contribute you

764
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,440
really you do have a lot of experience

765
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,639
that is really valuable and people want

766
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,880
to hear about it so I think it's worth

767
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:10,600
remembering that while your experience

768
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,320
is different it is just as valuable and

769
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,519
people will want to hear about it um I

770
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,840
think the other thing to remember as

771
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,960
well and this is something that I still

772
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,200
have to remind myself but just because

773
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,039
you may not feel like you are qualified

774
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,799
or that you should be there don't self-

775
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:29,440
select out like have someone tell you no

776
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,279
don't tell yourself no because you know

777
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,399
I think this often happens with with

778
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,120
military applicants is is maybe you just

779
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,600
feel like you don't have the relevant

780
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,279
background or you're not really sure how

781
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,600
to craft your narrative but like I

782
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:46,240
implore you have someone tell you no

783
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,880
don't don't self- selck out because um

784
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,279
like we have really special and

785
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,799
important experiences that need to be

786
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,840
shared and Sloan really values that and

787
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,960
I think that it's important to make sure

788
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,840
that you're giving yourself a shot at

789
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,639
anywhere you want to go

790
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,000
yeah know that that was a awesome

791
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:08,639
response yeah if anyone would like to

792
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,679
take it back off that and have any

793
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:13,360
opinions I'll I'll I'll Echo what

794
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,519
Valerie said I I took a semester class

795
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,240
on power negotiation which I loved and

796
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,960
one of the lessons from it was the

797
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,519
answer is always no un let you ask so

798
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:27,000
ask apply um but I'll also Echo the uh

799
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,960
piece about leadership it's it's give

800
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,080
and take right like um you can give your

801
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,760
classmates a lot of examples of tangible

802
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,200
leadership of like ethically challenging

803
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,159
situations you have navigated through uh

804
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,000
and your classmates are going to be

805
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,840
Future Leaders of corporate America

806
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,480
there there's going to be CEOs from your

807
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,639
class right they're going to have huge

808
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,399
amounts of of power in the real world um

809
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:53,240
you have a chance to shape their ethical

810
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,639
decision making for the better that's

811
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,799
really cool that's the the give I think

812
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:02,000
the take is um I mean I didn't know what

813
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,120
Revenue was uh my accounting test kind

814
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,760
of proved that to me but when that

815
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,639
happened right there was a uh you know

816
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,200
an accountant in my core team who was

817
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,320
more than happy to explain that to me

818
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,679
and teach me

819
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,159
so that's something that I think the

820
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,520
military prepared you all for is if you

821
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,280
don't know what you're doing like you

822
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:25,359
are ready to admit that and go ask and

823
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:28,040
get help and learn it uh so that is um

824
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,839
that's the superpower to tackling ult

825
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,560
things to learning to trying hard

826
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,159
classes all the things that slan is that

827
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,879
you succeed at because you're willing to

828
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,879
go work in a

829
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,440
Dean yeah know

830
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,800
it's yeah it's just a different

831
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,359
experience we that we bring to Sloan

832
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,960
yeah and then Justin yeah

833
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:52,800
just kind of like another Nuance on on

834
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,639
what they've said but one of the and

835
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,960
it's been it was asked in the chat um as

836
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,480
well but the like at least and this is

837
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,119
this was my experience but the way

838
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,440
respect and like curiosity from my

839
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,520
classmates about what I had done in the

840
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,920
military far surpassed anything I

841
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
expected um you know I expected most

842
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,880
people to like not really care or maybe

843
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,560
you know on the impostor side of things

844
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,720
like yeah you're just a vet you don't

845
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,880
you've never done any of the things

846
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,880
we've done um or you know you're coming

847
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,920
in from like a basis of much a much

848
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,880
lower like knowledge basis than I have

849
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,960
you know or something like that it was

850
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,359
the exact opposite I thought and I'm

851
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,599
sure this is true in a lot of other NBA

852
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,079
programs but I was actually really blown

853
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,599
away at like oh no people care about

854
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,160
this people care about what I have to

855
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,920
say about you know this example of some

856
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,440
yeah to Andrew's Point like ethical

857
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,839
leadership question I had to answer um

858
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,760
they don't just tolerate it they like

859
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,920
actively seek it out and I think that

860
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,520
was something that um really surprised

861
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,520
me and you know made me feel better in

862
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,960
that imposter concept right because like

863
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,760
I do have something to bring here or I

864
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,880
have some experience that is valuable to

865
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,599
my core team to my ocean to this

866
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,119
particular class discussion or whatever

867
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,119
the case would

868
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,880
be yeah I know that's that's awesome and

869
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:16,640
and uh I want to set aside some time for

870
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,160
some open Q&A it looks like there's some

871
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,800
questions from Rachel one of the

872
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,240
classes uh one of the her questions was

873
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,640
you know what class was the most

874
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,200
memorable or kind of helpful you know

875
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,280
that helped you throughout your career

876
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,960
and uh Chris would would love to hear

877
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,760
what what your thoughts are on

878
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,880
this um yeah yeah happy to elaborate so

879
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,680
I said

880
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,240
op um and I so op is our class called

881
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,839
organizational processes uh we take it

882
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,079
during our first semester as a part of

883
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:56,200
core um the class

884
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,079
covers um how organizations function and

885
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,880
work and

886
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,760
uh it's really a series of case studies

887
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,880
on culture on uh how to design a company

888
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,599
you know what's your or organizational

889
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,040
chart um how is power distributed

890
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,480
there's so many different things it goes

891
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,960
into um what I think was important about

892
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,319
that and I think how I related with

893
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,720
veterans is that like there was a

894
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:22,839
particular case we did Mount Everest I

895
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,000
don't know if you guys remember that the

896
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:28,359
high stakes Mount Everest case um where

897
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,720
the Vets kind of just took over because

898
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:33,200
you know it's it's it's a case about um

899
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,680
uh having to make tough decisions to

900
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,640
save people's lives and we were

901
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,520
explaining how through the military

902
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,720
experience how we kind of did the same

903
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,319
thing and how decisions should be made

904
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,319
within a company and how they were made

905
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:48,480
on Mount Everest so I thought that was

906
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:51,400
great yeah and I've used that all of

907
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,160
that uh what I've learned in the actual

908
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,880
workplace um very very important stuff

909
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,880
to kind of take with you I open my

910
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,359
casebook every now and then like if I

911
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,079
have a rough employee I'm like a what do

912
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,680
I need to do how do I change the culture

913
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,880
so it's it's great

914
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:11,800
stuff yeah Mike any uh classes from your

915
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,440
your year here that's

916
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,960
memorable yeah I'd have to say um

917
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,880
healthc Care lab so I actually there was

918
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,960
a there was a um semester that I went

919
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,040
heavy on the health care classes because

920
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,000
that interested me and and I wanted to

921
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,280
to learn more and um you know I was part

922
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,440
of a team um our project involved

923
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,599
working um with an outpatient clinic at

924
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:37,440
a major Hospital in downtown Boston um

925
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,880
and we really got to use some of our um

926
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,319
some of the the the uh experience and

927
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,319
coursework that we had learned modeling

928
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,040
in during operations management and we

929
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:49,560
got to apply it to a real world

930
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:52,119
situation um that was pretty cool um to

931
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:56,280
actually see that in action but part of

932
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,359
it um was also because um it was a

933
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,920
situation where

934
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,359
um and this is to kind of go back on

935
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,160
what we were talking about before with

936
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,200
leadership and and you don't you don't

937
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,960
really value the leadership experience

938
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,359
that you bring um when you realize that

939
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,359
that you have a lot more experience than

940
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,599
other people and I ended up um

941
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,079
ultimately stepping into not because I

942
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,000
wanted to but because we needed it um

943
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,800
into a project management role and and

944
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,640
it was important for me because it gave

945
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,640
me

946
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,440
confidence um you know to know that I

947
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,119
could take the skills that I had learned

948
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,440
in the military

949
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,359
um and apply them in in a you know to a

950
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,920
essentially a private sector

951
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:41,040
um um uh situation and be successful so

952
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,880
so you know it was it was uh important

953
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,680
from from both the you know perspective

954
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,400
of of being able to use what what I had

955
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,359
learned um to solve actual real world

956
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,200
problems but also it was a big

957
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,480
confidence booster for me as well yeah

958
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,680
know and you know that's the big thing

959
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,760
about MIT you know that action learning

960
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,960
Labs where you can actually do and learn

961
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,359
which is

962
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,079
amazing for Justin and Valerie um a

963
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,560
question for you and you know I'm

964
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,040
reading this and I'm chuckling

965
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,760
um when you initially applied to Sloan

966
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,240
you

967
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,760
know and you had a plan on what you

968
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,560
thought you wanted to do coming into you

969
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,160
know NBA like did that change post MBA

970
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,920
and just you know if you want to give

971
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,280
some broader you know at least anecdotal

972
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,079
evidence as well from you saw amongst

973
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,079
your your cohort as

974
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,960
well yeah I can

975
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,400
start so I work in consulting which is a

976
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:45,000
very you know Common sort of post MBA

977
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,319
role that was not initially my plan I

978
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,280
think it is something that a lot of

979
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,040
veterans end up doing uh because a lot

980
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,440
of people view it as sort of like an MBA

981
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,720
2.0 like you go and you learn a lot of

982
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,599
skills and then you are in this kind of

983
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,119
very structured company where you can

984
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:04,000
then apply those across a wide range of

985
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,839
Industries um so it that did not sort of

986
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,560
align with my initial plan I thought I'd

987
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,640
be doing a little bit more um in sort of

988
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,640
humanitarian International

989
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,000
work what I would say is and what I

990
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,680
would just highly highly recommend is to

991
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,599
spend the time learning in talking to

992
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,839
people about all of the different career

993
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:27,480
options like this is something that I

994
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:29,079
did not do enough and I think that it is

995
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,319
like this is part of I mean this is

996
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,720
truly the reason you're going is even if

997
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,440
you have a very clear picture of what

998
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,280
you're doing you're given this sort of

999
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,200
like Halo as a student where you can

1000
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,400
reach out to anyone you can talk to

1001
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,160
anyone you can LinkedIn DM I mean it's

1002
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,720
really I would encourage you all to take

1003
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,640
the time to really reflect and be

1004
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,800
intentional about what you want your

1005
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,960
life to look like post business school

1006
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,560
because it can look like a lot of things

1007
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,800
and and and and and it's all positive

1008
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,240
but it's like you need to be in control

1009
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,000
of what you want it to look like and how

1010
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,520
you want it to turn out and so I

1011
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,560
I I I think that it could be

1012
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,040
intimidating to some but I think if you

1013
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,640
can reframe it as it's really exciting

1014
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,640
two years to figure out what the heck

1015
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,599
you want to do with the rest of your

1016
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,760
life and you are in no better position

1017
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,400
to have all of the resources to to help

1018
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,400
you figure that

1019
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,319
out um yeah I mentioned it in the uh

1020
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:26,359
like my typed answer but one of the cool

1021
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:27,720
things about Sal is they actually don't

1022
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:29,880
ask you that question

1023
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,440
um like other schools do and I think

1024
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,000
that's a really unique aspect because

1025
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,280
you're going to find you know to the

1026
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,119
anecdotal thing will mention like most

1027
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,119
of your class friends don't have any

1028
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,400
idea what they want to do either um you

1029
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,800
know everyone just

1030
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,079
seemingly um makes up some sort of path

1031
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,079
that they should be on and then tells

1032
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,280
all the schools that that's what they

1033
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,640
want to do for me that was like I wrote

1034
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,760
everything as if I wanted to be a banker

1035
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,720
um because for like a brief moment in

1036
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,000
time I did uh and you know I just kind

1037
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,640
of had to pick one learned as much as I

1038
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,920
could about it to explain it interviews

1039
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,559
and things like that and then I got to

1040
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,400
school and I immediately shifted to

1041
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:07,160
Consulting um and then could not Echo

1042
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:10,559
Valerie's Point more like take the time

1043
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,000
to like actually evaluate things even if

1044
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,599
you know the the vetsa consulting or

1045
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,640
vets the even banking pipeline is like

1046
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,800
really well kind of fraud like do

1047
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,599
evaluate other things like I'm not doing

1048
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,839
consulting now and I will tell you like

1049
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,319
from getting the hey you're graduating

1050
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,960
in June 2023 but we're not going to

1051
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,760
start you until January

1052
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:37,280
2024 so having like eight months of like

1053
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,000
oh what am I going to do uh you know and

1054
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,839
I was like I honestly don't even know

1055
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,960
what like I want to do it all I just

1056
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,040
wanted to go do consulting which was the

1057
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,000
intent the intent was to like figure it

1058
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,480
out there but I could have used the two

1059
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,520
years of my NBA to spend more time doing

1060
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,319
exactly that um and I'm super happy like

1061
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,079
doing what I'm doing now uh just kind of

1062
00:43:55,319 --> 00:44:00,800
lefted out to be honest um

1063
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,240
and so yeah like use the use the

1064
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,559
resources of both being a student and

1065
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,200
people being willing to open their doors

1066
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,920
and talk to you or answer their phone

1067
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,599
and talk to you um as well as like you

1068
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,640
know if for those of you who do end up

1069
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,040
at MIT like getting to use the MIT

1070
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,240
ecosystem to also do the expiration on

1071
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,079
that side um and yeah that's like yeah I

1072
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,599
could not recommend that more because I

1073
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,200
did not do a good job of that uh you

1074
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,359
know and I've yeah I would have actually

1075
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,359
made better probably networking I would

1076
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:30,760
like you know one of the things about

1077
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,160
NBA r two years to network I would have

1078
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,720
had a better Network in my current

1079
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,880
industry had I actually spent more time

1080
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,839
evaluating my industry while at my NBA

1081
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
um and so that would have been a really

1082
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:42,440
it's been awesome already but like it

1083
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,440
would have been

1084
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:50,119
a no Justin that's awesome thanks for

1085
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,400
sharing that and for Andrew before we

1086
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,839
hand it over back to Terrell we got some

1087
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,200
questions here for you so I think

1088
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,720
there's a a Common Thread of people

1089
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,760
asking

1090
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,040
like how was the lgo workload like how

1091
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,680
did you manage that personally like you

1092
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,800
know what were your kind of techniques

1093
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,599
and you know just truly bluntly how how

1094
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,079
was it um the second part to that is you

1095
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,440
know did you have to have a lot of Prior

1096
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,559
technical experience like did you focus

1097
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:23,200
in Ai and in undergrad and I think the

1098
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,440
third part is you know if I want to be

1099
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,000
an entrepreneur and I want to create a

1100
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,200
company should I be going lgo route to

1101
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,680
be closer to Engineers or should I be

1102
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:37,280
going the full-time uh NBA

1103
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:40,960
route good questions um maybe the last

1104
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,960
one I'll give a very simple answer uh if

1105
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,960
you are doing lgo you spending a lot of

1106
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,800
time on engineering classes which is

1107
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,319
time you can't be spending on a startup

1108
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,640
so just from time management you might

1109
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,559
not want to do it uh the second one

1110
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,559
about technical experience undergrad I

1111
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,720
did mechanical engineering that was

1112
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:04,400
mostly heat transfer Statics um Dynamics

1113
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,800
I coded a bit I liked it but I it was

1114
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,440
not a CS undergrad um I did mechanical

1115
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,280
engineering at lgo uh and the really

1116
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,640
cool thing about that uh is that they I

1117
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,359
didn't have to apply to CS because I

1118
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,119
didn't think I'd get in and I was still

1119
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:19,079
able to take a bunch of AI classes

1120
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,960
because they're pretty loose on the

1121
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:22,520
credit requirements for mechanical

1122
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,200
engineering

1123
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,200
um I wish I had taken some even harder

1124
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,880
classes I strayed away from and in true

1125
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,240
military fashion if you are doing

1126
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,960
something with a buddy uh you will

1127
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,400
probably get through it and I took that

1128
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,839
approach to those classes and it was

1129
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,079
fine um learned a lot made even better

1130
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:43,599
friendships by trying to do some really

1131
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:48,280
hard things together uh and

1132
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:50,480
then one more question oh yeah and then

1133
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:54,160
um terms of just managing the course

1134
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,520
load uh you I think I said it before but

1135
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,440
you spend more time on engineering

1136
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,240
classwork than your peers you spend more

1137
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,319
time on just class work than your peers

1138
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,559
uh

1139
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,559
and

1140
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:07,200
that's that's a choice you make when you

1141
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:08,480
go into the program but you still get to

1142
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,599
choose how you spend the rest of your

1143
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,880
time and you get to choose how much

1144
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:16,480
effort you put into your classes um

1145
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,440
classes are pretty easy to pass they're

1146
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,400
hard to do well in and as a graduate

1147
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,720
student uh you should be mature enough

1148
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,319
to choose what it is that you want to

1149
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,640
get out of those classes and focus on

1150
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,680
that right and that was a little

1151
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,000
different from undergrad where I think I

1152
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,920
just tried to go and learn what the

1153
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,280
syllabus was everything on the syllabus

1154
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,720
you get to choose you have a little more

1155
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,280
flexibility um you should use that

1156
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:45,800
wisely to prioritize uh social life

1157
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,160
clubs exploring career opportunities all

1158
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,640
the things that MIT gives you you're in

1159
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,640
control that's what's cool about

1160
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,319
it awesome thank you guys yeah seriously

1161
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,079
thank you again so much you guys come

1162
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,440
from such incredible backgrounds and

1163
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,240
it's great to hear from you guys again

1164
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,920
and you guys definitely B out some

1165
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,119
experience on all these prospective

1166
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:13,119
students who hopefully you know we'll

1167
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:13,119
all see in Cambridge sometime soon
