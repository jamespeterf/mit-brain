1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,759
so on the TV commercial there's a lady

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:11,940
singing is singing so loudly s that the

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:15,800
glass breaks can we get a volunteer

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,760

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,240
today very good try fortunately we are

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,039
in it so we have designed a device which

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,160
actually can help us to achieve this so

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,500
what I'm going to do now is to start

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,279
producing sunwave

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,120

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,120
so you can see that clearly we don't

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,120
have uh resonance yet so what I am going

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,280
to do is to

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,280
increase the

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,600
frequency job perfect that's the quick

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,440
one we yeah thank you very much for more

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,120
