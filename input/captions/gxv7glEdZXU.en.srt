00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,440
I think semiconductor technology is

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,400
really the key to address like global

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,110
challenges for example energy deficiency

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,590
and uh climate

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,590

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,560
change. My research is related to high

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,519
temperature electronics that can be

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,279
operated in a high temperature

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,279
environment. So this can um apply to

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,920
many fields that requires extreme

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,480
conditions. One of the main like

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,120
promising semiconductor materials we're

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,480
using is gallium nitride which is known

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,079
for its ability to endure extreme

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,800
environment. So this work is extremely

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,920
important because um it applies to a lot

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,239
of fields. Um for example uh renewable

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
geothermal energy is one of them. It

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,120
requires drilling technologies and

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,239
sensoring systems that often requires

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,280
temperatures at range around like 500°

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,199
C. So um it is very important to

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
consider the possibilities of high

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,840
temperature gallium nitride electronic

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,320
components. It's very interesting to see

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
how semiconductor materials is

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,260
interconnected or related to the

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,090
advancement in clean energy fields.
