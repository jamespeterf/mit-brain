1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
e

2
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,480
okay I think we could probably get

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,079
started with the sort of formalities

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,840
um so welcome to Nano Explorations today

5
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,160
um before I introduce today's speaker

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,719
just a couple of words about sort of

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,960
the uh housekeeping items um please hold

8
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,719
your questions to the end of the session

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,640
that will be a Q&A session and to ask

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
question you can do this three ways you

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,239
can use the Q&A you can use the chat or

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,400
you can simply raise your hand and we'll

13
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:06,360
keep track of the ones that raise their

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,960
hands and make sure you get a chance to

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,799
actually speak up and with your

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,280
question so today's speaker is ziling

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,119
Chen who is a go by the name of

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,000
Zach I'm fortunate that my name is Claus

19
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,000
Jensen and I'm Jin in chemical

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
engineering Material Science and I'm

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,640
been fortunate to be the mentor of Zach

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,360
here at MIT uh Zach did his uh

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,159
Bachelor's in chemistry at Cornell and

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,680
then went from there to uh

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,560
Berkeley uh where he worked with

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,719
Professor Omar yagi and you will see

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,320
much of the work that he did for his PhD

28
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,000
in his talk today on atmospheric

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,520
harvesting with nanoscale metal organic

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,240
Frameworks um Zak is a excellent

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,479
presenter he has had opportunity to

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,880
present at m at many different

33
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:06,240
um small small and large

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,640
venues ACS meetings mrss meetings and so

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,480
on um and as also at universities um and

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,720
he's really uh in what you will hear

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,319
today is is really on using large

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,239
language models uh to help research in

39
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,120
um metal organic Frameworks but he's

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,599
also used this while he's been a postet

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,480
MIT to do completely different work on

42
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,239
um new ways to come up with reactions

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,519
for uh electrochemical reactions for

44
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,599
oxidation

45
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,120
reactions so um I don't want to take any

46
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,720
more of Zach's time uh I think we can

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,000
turn it over to Zach it's about 1105 so

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,560
we can start so um with that Zack if

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,120
you're ready yes okay so thank you CLA

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,560
so much for the nice introduction so

51
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,920
good morning everyone so my name is Zach

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
and today so you know know as CL this

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,440
discuss so you know I had my PhD in uh

54
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,799
UC Berkeley uh for you know experimental

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,840
work in the moth and later you know I

56
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,680
transition into you know combining both

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,920
Ai and moth you know for the material

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,319
Discovery and now at MIT I'm doing the

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,840
larg input model for the uh chemical

60
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,799
reaction uh designing and optimization

61
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,200
so today you know for the topic of this

62
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,640
talk so I will be mainly focus on the

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,080
you know like the work I have done in my

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,840
uh PhD which is mainly focused on the

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,640
experimental side and that is on the

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,640
topic of you know uh trying to study how

67
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,560
quizine materials can actually be

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,799
engineered at Atomic level to address

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,159
the global challenges such as the water

70
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,519
shortage so to begin my talk I want to

71
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,200
first uh starways you know like some of

72
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,239
the backgrounds here and so particularly

73
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,159
you know in terms of topic of the global

74
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,920
water shortage as I mentioned so in fact

75
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,239
nowadays uh nearly half of the world's

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,760
population lives in a place where you

77
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,079
know clean and drinkable water is not

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,040
accessible year around so if you you

79
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,799
know look at this uh figure so actually

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,400
the this number is ised to grow about

81
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,320
five billions in the next few decades as

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,000
you know predicted by the you report so

83
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,639
why is that so as you can see so in this

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
figure so the main reason of you know

85
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
this kind of growing you know population

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,320
in terms of water shortage is that there

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,080
is uneven distribution of the Water

88
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,639
Resource across different location at

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,840
the different times of year so while

90
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,160
some places you know receive plenty of

91
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,960
the precipitation during the winter time

92
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,360
so the Water Resource may be quite

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,560
Limited in the summer and you know there

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,440
are some geological difference in terms

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,680
of making some region make the necessary

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,400
infrastructure to deliver drinkable

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,320
water so finding a way to assess water

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,440
at any place at any you know time of a

99
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,360
year is very important to adjust you

100
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,639
know this situation and fight against

101
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,639
the water

102
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,800
shortage so one proposed solution here

103
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,680
is that you know we can actually harvest

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,960
the moisture directly from the air so in

105
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,400
fact the amount of water contained in

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,400
the air is actually six times larger

107
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,919
than the volume of the sun of all the

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,680
rivers on our planet so that's a huge

109
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,120
amount actually however making this you

110
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,039
know water exraction process directly

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,400
from the air actually you know um can be

112
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,560
energy consuming and sometimes you know

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,639
making it like a energy efficient way to

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,800
get this drinkable water is actually a

115
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,360
big challenge so in recent years so it

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,160
was you know increasingly uh uh study

117
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,280
that you know using sance as a way to

118
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,160
assist you know the condensation of the

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,280
water fly air uh can be a very feasible

120
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,120
solution and you know this technology

121
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,919
which is called you know Soban assist

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,759
atmosphere first world har thing has G

123
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,639
increasing attention so among all of

124
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,720
these you know commercial Sant or the

125
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,479
problem that is being studied in the lab

126
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,039
actually metal organic Frameworks have

127
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,560
shown great promise you know for this

128
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,680
application so now the question you know

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,120
you may ask is that what is metal

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,000
organic Frameworks which is prev as moth

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,960
and how do this you know moth you know

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,400
capture water so essentially you can

133
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,840
think of you know this Mo material as

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,080
like a logo set where you know you have

135
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,800
different bricks of various shape and

136
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,560
sizes so in this case so you can

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,520
customize you know this material

138
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,319
materials at Atomic level by precisely

139
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,080
tuning the types of metal and the

140
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,840
organic molecules to change both their

141
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,160
physical and chemical properties for

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,560
instance with this you know mo C3 uh

143
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,680
which you know uh has this luminum you

144
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,960
know building blocks as well as this

145
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,479
organic Linker which is uh parazol 35 di

146
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,800
carboxilate so you can actually create a

147
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,000
very hydrophilic Pro environment you

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,879
know in its cavities by using this par

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,240
Linker which has two nitrogen which is

150
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,039
shown in the green here uh to make it

151
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,720
very you know attractive to the water

152
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,440
molecules so in this case you know a

153
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,120
typical proc size is about one nomer and

154
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,639
as you can see this periodic exan

155
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,800
structure uh can make it into you know

156
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
the narrow scale particles or even

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,080
sometimes grow into the much larger

158
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,240
single crystals and you can essentially

159
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,639
Sy of you know this you know M materials

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,919
as a very tiny crystaline sponge and you

161
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,240
know you will just chart water based on

162
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,720
its microscopic structures so since this

163
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,160
is a very highly crystaline structure we

164
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,360
can actually use the single Crystal X3

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,560
defraction to precisely show to see that

166
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,159
how it interact with the uh water

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,000
molecules which is traveling inside its

168
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,319
you know cavities so in this case so

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,400
here I'm showing you like a 3D structure

170
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:59,199
of the M ser3 as you can see here so

171
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,520
this is a highly Pros materials with a

172
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,199
very large internal surface area and the

173
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,120
fre volumes so when we zoom into this

174
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,520
specific channel so you can see that you

175
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,800
know as in the videoos play so you you

176
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,360
can exactly learn from the single

177
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,199
Crystal X3 that where the exact position

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,879
of this water molecule emerg and it's

179
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,560
actually attracted by the uh the uh the

180
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,800
hydrophilic nitrogen atoms and then so

181
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,759
once you get these four four first you

182
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,199
know water cluster so they will just

183
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,440
accumulate by attracting more so at the

184
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,440
end of day you know than to this large

185
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,919
pole volume so it can store a

186
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,800
significant amount of water inside its

187
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,880
cavities under the ambient

188
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,719
conditions so in fact you know uh this

189
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,200
motivates us to actually you know

190
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,800
incorporate this material as a sent to

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,279
the device and it it has successfully

192
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,959
been test in the moav desert back on

193
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,160
2019 to harvest water from the dry

194
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,519
Desert Air however at that moment a few

195
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
challenges remind to further expand

196
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,640
application of what water harvesting

197
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,399
with Ms first of all the synthesis of

198
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,760
the MS remind to be low yield and could

199
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,240
only be made in the milligram scales

200
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,079
which I will talk more later second so

201
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,959
it will be ideal if we can uh have the

202
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,440
solent to be adapt into different

203
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,240
environmental conditions for instance

204
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,760
like to answer question of how can we

205
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,920
make land to be even you know to take

206
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,720
more water or even make them to be

207
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,120
energy efficient when dissolving the

208
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,680
water molecules so the so you know so

209
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,360
which means that the so LM M the

210
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,079
designing principle for the water

211
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,240
harvesting MTH should be developed for

212
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,720
the tailor

213
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,760
properties so you know let's start with

214
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,320
the first challenge which is the

215
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,600
scalability in a typical M ser3

216
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
synthesis so typically you know as you

217
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,360
can see in this you know panel on the

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,079
right so like a 4 M uh culation V is

219
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,720
used to produce just a few milligrams of

220
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:59,560
Ms under the solo thermal conditions

221
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,360
which you know involves in mixing the

222
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,440
starting materials like aluminum

223
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,519
chloride and the pgdc Linker and

224
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
incubating them in an oven it may sound

225
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,000
surprising but it's actually true that

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,320
how much Mo you can actually make per

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,240
batch depends on the size of the oven so

228
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
typically you know the larger oven you

229
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,160
have like the more space you know you

230
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,200
can put with even like a larger jar

231
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,560
however you know even with this you know

232
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,680
like large you know 2 lit jar as I show

233
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,839
you here or even like if you go to about

234
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,839
like 10 lit so you will only get about 3

235
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,160
to five grams of Mo each time because

236
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,079
the reation yield is so low under this

237
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,040
Soo thermos synthesis and what is even

238
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,399
worse is that it takes about 24 hours to

239
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,880
complete the entire formation of the

240
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,040
microcrystalline powders so if you were

241
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,760
to shorten this reaction time so you

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,600
will actually end up with the more

243
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,279
aerous product with much less water

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,560
uptate capacity so in this case you know

245
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,399
the SpaceTime yield for this you know

246
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,000
Mor production under the soo Theros

247
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,000
synthesis is pretty low and if you

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,880
remember the device photo I show you in

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,200
the previous slide you know which is

250
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,959
this one so actually for this device

251
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,000
that was test back on 2019 so it

252
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,880
contains about 1 kilogram of M sent

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,880
about half a kilo to 1 kilogram of mbant

254
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,519
now you know simply just doing the mess

255
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,600
so I told you you know 4 the2 lit gel so

256
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,279
you have about four grams of moth and

257
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,480
now for just one device you need about

258
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,680
you know like one k that means you need

259
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,480
to repeat this you know dry and gel for

260
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,120
about like 300 times considering that

261
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,519
you know you uh you retra you you you

262
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,079
expect ideally have most of you know the

263
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,519
product recover after the purification

264
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,680
so which you know in this case is very

265
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,720
resource and label intensive and

266
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,079
preventing you know the further you know

267
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,720
uh deployment of this device you know in

268
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,839
a larger scale so now you know when I

269
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,240
began my you know uh PhD uh study so my

270
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,320
first research project was focused on

271
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,320
developing a high yield and scalable

272
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,519
method to overcome this traditional

273
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,000
limitation of the solo Theros synthesis

274
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,480
for the water harvesting Ms also you

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,079
know since the py me requires the use of

276
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,680
DMF you know which I show in the red

277
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,360
here so this is essentially the

278
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,760
abbreviation of the uh solvent dial

279
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
format which is uh you know many of you

280
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,720
if you are coming from a chemistry

281
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,040
background know that it's a very toxic

282
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,160
solvant so you know no one will actually

283
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,120
want to drink water uh Harvest from like

284
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,639
like a compound that is made of the

285
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,040
toxic solvant you know even though you

286
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,760
know you can uh uh convince people that

287
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,279
you know you have already use enough

288
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,040
washing to remove this one however you

289
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,680
know this still a challenge so I was you

290
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,160
know actually interesting in you know

291
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,639
replacing it with a more Beni solvent

292
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,560
you know such as you know water so which

293
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,560
can make uh which you know to make it to

294
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,519
be a green synthesis so essentially you

295
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,560
know uh towards this end so I actually

296
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,680
uh threw off some you know re

297
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,639
optimization and some you know like

298
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,279
Trail and arrow so I discovered that you

299
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,279
know by using the right story atric

300
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,040
amount of the in organic base and in

301
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,360
this case which is the sodium hydroxide

302
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,079
so the reaction could actually be done

303
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,399
using a conventional heating you know

304
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,680
with just constant Sterling in like a

305
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,720
oil base so essentially you know you can

306
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,800
just run this in like a organic

307
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,440
chemistry uh way like in a one port or

308
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,120
uh one port one button flux synthesis

309
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,440
and you know have having it to stir at

310
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,360
the reflux temperature of the water

311
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,600
which is 100° uh and now you know

312
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,839
exciting news is that so with this

313
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,279
better heat transfer and the constant

314
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,399
reagent mixing uh you know with this

315
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,519
conventional heating method so the time

316
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,920
required for the M crystallization is

317
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,600
greatly reduced and the product can be

318
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,399
actually made just within two hours

319
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,320
compared with you know the previous MTH

320
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,440
which will take you know like 15 hours

321
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,320
or even a day to uh

322
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,519
finish so now once we will be able to

323
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,079
show we can find alter alternative

324
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,279
method to make this compound so I was

325
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,800
actually be able to confirm that the

326
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,199
crystalinity of the product synthesized

327
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,720
by this Greener measure uh you know can

328
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,839
have the you know exactly the retention

329
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,199
of the same performance as you know the

330
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,000
traditional method so I was able to you

331
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,399
know run the PO X3 defraction and the

332
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
procity measurement to confirm this one

333
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,720
so as you can see on the uh on the

334
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,160
bottom left so which is the result of

335
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,399
the part XP defraction so you can see

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,079
basically you know in terms of the the

337
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,120
ph and the uh and the intensity of this

338
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,560
Pak so basically the traditional method

339
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,560
and the new meth uh pretty much you know

340
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,000
have the exact same you know pattern and

341
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,680
agree with each other and on the other

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,959
side you know if you do the BET surface

343
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,519
um bet surface area measurement you will

344
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,880
find that you know they essentially

345
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,440
retain the same procy meaning that you

346
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,199
know we are not doing any kind of

347
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,320
compromise by replacing you know like EX

348
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,920
in DMF with the new you know Greener me

349
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,279
and essentially they can achieve very

350
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,600
similar water

351
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,680
uptake so now you know uh encouraged by

352
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,440
the results from the you know the reflex

353
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,199
synthesis that is condu at the Grand uh

354
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,600
scale so I next move to the pilot scale

355
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,279
synthesis of Mo 33 by building up you

356
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,959
know by hand a 200 lit reator you know

357
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,639
in the lab so as I mentioned previously

358
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,360
so the traditional s server synthesis is

359
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,120
limited by the size of the reaction vers

360
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,880
and you know like the space you have in

361
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,920
the oven yet for this you know reflux

362
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,120
method you can almost you know have no

363
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,839
registration in terms of the synthesis

364
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,639
scale and you know but just which will

365
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,959
only depends on you know how large you

366
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,440
know the reator you want to build so

367
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,720
what was even more exciting is that so I

368
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,240
found this method can actually be

369
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,440
transferable to a lot of other aluminum

370
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,600
based Ms which can also be used for

371
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,240
outward harvesting so not just limiting

372
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,360
you know to the m 33 so in this case I

373
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,360
was be able to synthesize a whole series

374
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,160
of mod such as Calon D3 mu 160 aluminum

375
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,519
fery and so on and actually was be able

376
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,959
to produce them at at all kilogram

377
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,399
scales with over 90% of you as well so

378
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,720
as you can see on this you know

379
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,079
photographs on the bottom right corner

380
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,759
so up to about six different kinds of

381
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,600
moth were made by in high quality and in

382
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,360
a kilogram scale with this green M and

383
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,759
the calculate SpaceTime U is about a 100

384
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,880
times larger than a traditional s ccle

385
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,360
synthesis of the mths so so far I have

386
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,800
been showing you that you know how we

387
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,440
adjust the challenge of the scalability

388
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,600
and now you know we are moving to the

389
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,600
next challenge which is you know how to

390
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,079
answer the question on you like how we

391
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,199
can better design of the moth to you

392
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:49,560
know tailor for different environmental

393
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,120
conditions which you know by taking the

394
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,880
advantage of their

395
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,600
tunability so in this case uh we

396
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,720
introduce a mix Linker uh structure

397
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,560
which you know combining uh Hydro pH par

398
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,800
Linker which you show in in the previous

399
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,240
slide which is the Linker we use for the

400
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,480
M 33 and this is now abbreviate as

401
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,039
letter P with another you know

402
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,760
hydrophobic cyop Linker now abbreviate

403
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:18,160
as letter t uh uh to make this moth so

404
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,480
together so we can form like a series of

405
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,600
you know different moth structures by

406
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,880
you know having different input ratio of

407
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,240
these two linkers so you know to

408
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,400
understand this structural property

409
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,240
relationship of this you know new class

410
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,520
of the mixed Linker Ms so we first exam

411
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,960
that using the powder X3 defraction and

412
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,679
the SCM EDS so in both case so these

413
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,880
techniques show that you know those two

414
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,600
linkers were actually homogeneously

415
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,520
incorporate into one single phas rather

416
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,440
than forming like a mixture of just two

417
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,840
moths you know from Two linkers and in

418
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,520
this case you know for example you if

419
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,799
you look at the result from the Eds

420
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,960
images and if you look at this green

421
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,280
roll which is you know showing the uh

422
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,039
nitrogen percentage for you know each

423
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,400
you know uh composition so actually you

424
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:08,600
know you can see like the percentage

425
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,360
gradually you know uh decrease when you

426
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,880
move from PTA Z which you know you have

427
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,240
entire you have moth entirely made by

428
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,919
all the P Linker and when you are moving

429
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,200
to the uh pt0 a which is the mo that is

430
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,039
entirely made by the T Linker so there

431
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,240
is like a trend in the decrease and the

432
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,600
reverse Trend can be also see in terms

433
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,760
of the element software uh when when you

434
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,799
are moving in the same direction so this

435
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,679
is actually a result of you know the

436
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,640
similarity between the bond angle of two

437
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,520
Cabos linkers in both Paro and a cell

438
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,200
Linker so since they are very similar to

439
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,760
each other so we'll be able to

440
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,200
incorporate both of them within the same

441
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,720
framework rather than you know having

442
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,039
two separate framework function

443
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,799
together so in this case you know you

444
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,720
may ask you know why are we interesting

445
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,400
in incorporating both of them in the

446
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,080
same framework rather than just having

447
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,559
you know simply the fixed physical

448
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,640
mixture of two of them so the reason

449
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,000
behind this is that we want the precise

450
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,799
tuning of the structural composition

451
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,720
results in you know like different

452
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:14,080
properties in this case um so you know

453
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,240
um actually layer structure layer water

454
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,960
harvesting profile which you know in

455
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,720
terms of like how much water they can

456
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,000
take and and what humidity they start to

457
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,480
take water is actually influenced by

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,880
their you know uh internal composition

459
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,159
made by the Linker so in this case we'll

460
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,039
be able to show that you know by having

461
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,360
different composition of linker we can

462
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,760
actually fine tune the operation

463
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,640
humidity you know by by a very wide

464
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,280
range which is up to 20% using you know

465
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,120
different ratio of PN T Linker in the

466
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,280
synthesis so in this case uh we found

467
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,240
that the exact output composition ratio

468
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,320
in the framework is correlated with the

469
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,280
input ratio of the linkers we use during

470
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,360
the synthesis and in in some other case

471
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,159
you know let's say if you want to get uh

472
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,760
uh if you want to get sbin that is to be

473
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,559
applied in a more you know every region

474
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,280
which you know can be much drier so you

475
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,480
can actually have like more P Linker uh

476
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,520
to take place which can allow it to you

477
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,240
know Harvest water at early stage and

478
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,000
you know if you are actually want to you

479
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,960
know uh make a function at a less you

480
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,320
know every region so you can increase

481
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,080
the amount of the T Linker which will

482
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,480
you know uh decrease its oper which will

483
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,840
actually increase its operational uh

484
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,120
relative humity range but it will reduce

485
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,360
amount of energy and the requirement for

486
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,679
the uh dissol temperature it will take

487
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,039
for uh for the water to dissolve so in

488
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,559
this case um I was able to show that you

489
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,760
know we can actually control the

490
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,960
Regeneration temperature during the

491
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,520
temperature swing uh for the you know

492
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,440
like the M cycling so as you can see in

493
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,280
this you know bottom right panel so

494
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,799
depending on which structure you choose

495
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,080
so there is up to 14 degrees of

496
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,559
temperature difference in terms of you

497
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,559
know um dsorption temperature which

498
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,440
means that you know you can have like a

499
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,200
more energy efficient uh sent in terms

500
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,000
of specific condition so for instance

501
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,919
you know if you pick a composition with

502
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,120
a lower regeneration temperature for a

503
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,960
place where average relative humidity is

504
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,440
higher so you will actually reduce the

505
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,039
uh overall energy you will use during

506
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,320
the you know recycling of these

507
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,039
Ms so other than you know Shifting the

508
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,279
water isogen left and right which I

509
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,159
shown you in the previous slide uh by

510
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,559
you know tuning their composition so we

511
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,159
are also interested in make this water

512
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,840
abortion profile shift up and up and

513
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,480
down so which is controlling their water

514
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,080
capacity in this case by collaborating

515
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,559
with Professor from University of

516
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,559
Chicago and University of Minesota so we

517
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,840
can actually use the computational tools

518
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,240
to simulate the watertion profile for

519
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,200
different designs of moth and was able

520
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,960
to uh discover that you know if we can

521
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,440
actually insert a venal group you know

522
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,320
which is this CC double bond between the

523
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,559
heterocycle and the carate so we can

524
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,279
essentially retain the same topology and

525
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,440
you know like the connectivity between

526
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,840
the Linker and the metal as well as L

527
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,240
you know po geometry of the uh water

528
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,760
harvesting Ms while you know we also can

529
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,559
use this to make the Linker to be longer

530
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,039
which will essentially enhance their

531
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,200
paracity and the water soltion

532
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,520
uptake uh in this case you know uh so we

533
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,400
we actually move Beyond just the DFD

534
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,640
calculations and actually went to a lab

535
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,039
to synthesize this you know new linkers

536
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,000
since the calculation show that you know

537
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,679
they can have the retention of the same

538
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,559
geometry while increasing the water

539
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,520
uptake and you know convert these

540
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,240
synthesized molecules uh into the into a

541
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,960
moth by optimizing the synthesis

542
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,159
structure so on the right panel so you

543
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,440
will find the experimentally measured

544
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,360
isogen and isobar curves for uh for this

545
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,760
you know new Mo that we you know made in

546
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,240
the lab and where you know this Orange

547
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,200
Lines rep then the new moth with the

548
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,679
longer linkers which we call this one

549
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,600
long arm moths and those ones you know

550
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,120
as I shown you with the shorter Linker

551
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,320
we saw the insertion of the venal group

552
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,440
uh to be the original Mod which is shown

553
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,799
in the black lines so as you can see

554
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,400
clearly you know there is up to five 50%

555
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,120
of increase in terms of their water uh

556
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,640
harvesting uh properties uh and the

557
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,559
uptake also you know meaning that this

558
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,480
new compound can serve as a very

559
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,559
promising candidate for the next TR

560
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,679
generation of the waterhousing device by

561
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,720
having even lower dsorption you know

562
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,640
temperature and

563
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,240
energy so once we you know gain a lot of

564
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,960
you know knowledge and a designing

565
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,600
principle on both how to scale up the mo

566
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,159
and how to better Design This Mo for the

567
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,600
water harvesting application so we next

568
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,840
move to the next uh the final stage

569
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,000
which is building a device for the real

570
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,440
world application you know we just don't

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,279
we don't want just you know making them

572
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,039
off in the lab and just you know measure

573
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,039
their performance in the the lab scale

574
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,480
by rather we want to see if it can

575
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,760
actually you know translate into the

576
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,360
real world application uh by you know

577
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,200
setting up the proof concept device so

578
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,640
compar with the previous uh you know mo

579
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,679
water Harvester I show you earlier in

580
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,600
the slide which you know relies on the

581
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,279
use of solar p uh Power and electricity

582
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,279
you know to run this kind of

583
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,240
regeneration of the moth so in this case

584
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,200
uh our focus of this new generation uh

585
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,320
design is to answer the question of

586
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,799
whether or not we can have like a

587
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,200
portable device that can allow us to

588
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,399
just Harvest water without any human

589
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,080
intervention so that is essentially like

590
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,559
you know you have those kind of solar

591
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,159
panels on the top of a roof where you

592
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
know you can essentially think of you

593
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,559
know the analogy of this water

594
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,559
harvesting panel which you know you can

595
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,440
put on the top of your house and you

596
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,919
will just you know run it by itself and

597
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,840
then at the end of day you just collect

598
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,640
all this water so in this case so I want

599
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,039
to show you you know how our design you

600
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,399
know make this happen so first of all

601
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,159
you know during the nighttime so

602
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,600
actually you know the moth which is

603
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,159
placed in this you know moth chamber can

604
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,679
actually collat water from the air so

605
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,000
layer poles are actually very

606
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,720
hydrophilic enough so nothing need to be

607
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,120
done by just exposing it to the air and

608
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,200
it will just you know naturally get all

609
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,480
all of the water you know from the air

610
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,120
uh to be captured within its pole and

611
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,919
once it get saturated it will just

612
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,880
sitting there and waiting for the

613
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,799
sunlight to come in the daytime just

614
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,279
like a sponge so once it gets water so

615
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,960
the next the next job is to how to you

616
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,279
know we can get water out from these

617
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,799
solent so that's happening during the

618
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,159
daytime where you know the sunlight will

619
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,320
heat the mo band which cause it to you

620
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,480
know uh increase the temperature and

621
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,000
then you know dissolve the water so

622
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,080
since moth is a very highly quizzing and

623
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,559
periodic structure so the dsorption

624
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,960
requires much lower you know temperature

625
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,240
spring compared with the other sob and

626
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,159
can be down you know in a very short u

627
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,600
short time to evacuate all these water

628
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,880
molecules so in the end you know in this

629
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,039
way so you all get rid of the need for

630
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,039
the solar panels and electricity for the

631
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,640
dsorption but rather just rely on the

632
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:13,399
ambian sunlight to you know get water

633
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,960
out so at a fundamental

634
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:19,360
level uh the design of this device is

635
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,640
quite similar to like a a rotary

636
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,840
evaporator some of you if you are coming

637
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,080
from you know like a chemistry

638
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,360
background may maybe may may see this

639
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,720
design very you know familiar in this

640
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,039
case so you ually you are creating a

641
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,919
temperature you know gradient by hitting

642
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,840
one side and then just placing like a

643
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,960
condenser on the top to collect the

644
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,520
liquid so in order design you know the

645
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,919
way we collect the you know uh liquid is

646
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,039
that we put like a you know reflector

647
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,480
which you know can reduce the solar

648
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,039
ingredients on the top so the cooler

649
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,000
temperature will be achieved on the top

650
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,640
side while you know when the sun hit the

651
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,919
bottom so the water molecule will become

652
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,600
hotter and once they travel to this top

653
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,600
side so it just become uh condense and

654
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,679
you know uh turning into the droplet and

655
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,399
a drinkable water so now you know we

656
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,880
have you know this design of the moth uh

657
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:11,840
assemble and then so once we you know

658
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,480
test it on the laboratory environment so

659
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,600
we were actually very excited to you

660
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,440
know to find a place that we can you

661
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,880
know do the fu test to to to make sure

662
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,679
that you know it can actually you know

663
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,440
run under you know the actual real word

664
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,159
condition so in this case so we decide

665
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,200
to test it only Des Valley National Park

666
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,360
so many of you may have already known

667
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,720
that you know this place is very famous

668
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,279
for the hottest temperature on this

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,720
planet because you know in Califoria the

670
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,240
Sia Nevada just uh mountains just you

671
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,919
know uh hinder all this kind of moisture

672
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,679
from the uh Pacific Ocean and which

673
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:48,600
making you know the lowest position on

674
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,679
the North American which is des Val to

675
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,880
be you know one of the driest place on

676
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,760
this uh on on the North America so our

677
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,919
motivation behind this is that if we can

678
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,080
demonstrate that this device can Harvest

679
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,919
water even under such extreme uh

680
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,960
condition so that basically means that

681
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,399
you know this device has a potential to

682
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,559
be you know um to be uh to be

683
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,320
functioning in most you know other place

684
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,880
on this planet so for a typical you know

685
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,559
testing cycle so as you can see on these

686
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,960
you know like uh animations so we

687
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,360
typically start at about 700 p.m after

688
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,039
the sunset by you know setting up the

689
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,120
necessary sensors to collect the

690
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,039
environmental data and just leave there

691
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,000
without any human intervention for the

692
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,840
next 24 hours and in particular you know

693
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,640
as you can see in uh both two figures so

694
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,279
you know we have like laptop to just

695
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,480
monitor you know like the uh temperature

696
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,720
and the uh humidity level around the

697
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,399
device but in reality you know when you

698
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,200
are trying to run this device you don't

699
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:49,200
have to have this laptop you can just

700
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,120
have this you know device to sit in

701
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,279
there and then to harvest water and we

702
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,440
also you know decide two different place

703
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:59,640
to you know test our device um one is at

704
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,440
a central of the you know like the Death

705
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,679
Valley so if you go to the Death Valley

706
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,720
National Park so one of the M VY place

707
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,559
will be this you know Furnace Creek

708
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,240
which is known as the you know lowest

709
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:12,279
place on the uh North America and it's

710
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,600
usually famous for its very hot air

711
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:15,440
during the summer and we did it you know

712
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,799
in

713
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,159
2022 summer of 2022 which is you know

714
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,600
one of the historically hottest time

715
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,200
during the

716
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,720
um only that's very National Park and

717
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,120
the other side we also choose was only

718
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,880
uh e bound of the park which has a

719
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,519
slightly different landscape and the

720
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,720
environmental condition so and then so

721
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,679
you know we will actually so after

722
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,559
running you know the device at you know

723
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,440
two different location so we were

724
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,480
actually very excited to see that you

725
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,159
know this device works really well under

726
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,760
you know both uh condition and could

727
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,519
consistently produce water during the

728
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,960
daytime so as you can see from you know

729
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,240
this these two diagram from the right

730
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,360
which is the result from the sensors

731
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,880
which monitor the temperature and the

732
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,320
moisture so the moth bad which is you

733
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,039
know represented by this uh red curve

734
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,880
can heat up to uh about 100 degrees

735
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,799
Celsius uh during the day and which you

736
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,120
know uh create about like a 40 degrees

737
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,000
of the uh difference with this uh

738
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,559
temperature from the condenser as you

739
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,519
can see in this uh blue line so that

740
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,039
means that you know even under such you

741
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,279
know hot conditions this you know uh

742
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,519
temperature difference is huge in enough

743
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,880
to make sure you still be able to

744
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,399
condense drinkable water into the

745
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,080
droplets under such you know extreme

746
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,399
condition which is nearly you know

747
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,159
impossible with most of the other

748
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:43,600
Technologies thinking about the fact

749
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,080
that Des Val was like pretty hot during

750
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,480
the data in the

751
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,600
summer Additionally you know if you look

752
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,799
at this blue curve on the uh on the

753
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,760
bottom right corner so you will see that

754
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,320
which is you know essentially the

755
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,279
relative humidity inside the uh the

756
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,600
reflector so it actually you know

757
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,080
quickly erase about two hours just after

758
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,840
the sunrise and start you know to uh you

759
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,080
know generate the water consistently and

760
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,720
you know here's a photo of you know

761
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,120
three of us uh standing uh in front of a

762
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,120
thermometer as you can see so you know

763
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,720
when we are testing this device so it

764
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,960
actually reaches about 122 degree

765
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,840
Fahrenheit which is 50 degre Celsius so

766
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,919
this is actually by far uh in my opinion

767
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,919
the one of the most extreme conditions

768
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,559
ever test for the atmospheric water

769
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,840
harvesting in the fueld test and in this

770
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,600
case so as you can see in this you know

771
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,600
data on the middle and this you know

772
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,840
video so the device constantly produce a

773
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,240
lot of water and even compared with the

774
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,120
previous work using Mo absorbance so we

775
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,120
are actually getting much more in terms

776
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,200
of Water Production in this case so in

777
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,639
addition you know since the mo has a

778
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,519
great you know structural stability

779
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:57,240
actually we also run the cycling

780
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,720
experiment and which which was actually

781
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,519
done in the last because you know we

782
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,519
want to see how many cycles it can

783
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,480
actually run so the result actually

784
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,279
turns out that it can you know last for

785
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,440
about more than 5,000 Cycles with less

786
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,880
than 5% of rul in the overall capacity

787
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,960
that means that you know you can keep

788
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,519
the same Mo chamber running for about

789
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,159
like 10 years or even more which you

790
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,159
know in the long term is uh will reduce

791
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,240
the cost of you know the Regeneration of

792
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,320
the water since you know it relies

793
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,799
nothing other than just the sunlight and

794
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,679
you don't need to replace it you know

795
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,600
for the next 10 years if nothing happens

796
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,960
so you also you should should also

797
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,919
acknowledge that you know besides Mo so

798
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,519
there are also like other great you know

799
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,760
soent like hydrogels and zelit you know

800
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,120
out there to be uh explored by the other

801
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,880
you know research groups and the

802
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,200
commercialized companies for these

803
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,480
technology and we envision that you know

804
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,519
overall this device design you at a

805
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,960
design level will be helpful you know to

806
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,559
further expand incorporate other choice

807
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,840
of the Sant to make this technology you

808
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:00,000
know more widely spread and you know be

809
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,399
being accessible to everyone and

810
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,440
ultimately you know uh provide like a

811
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,760
clean water solution to many water

812
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,679
shortage

813
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,159
areas so with that uh hopefully you know

814
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,440
today uh as a summary hopefully today I

815
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,200
have been showing you a story about uh

816
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,840
the development of these narrow scale

817
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,480
crystalling materials for water

818
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,880
harvesting application so we talk about

819
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,960
how you know we start from the uh

820
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,919
synthesis optimization to solve the

821
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,519
scalability of these na scale materials

822
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,360
also I show you you know how the

823
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,960
insights from the designing principle

824
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,320
for the water harvesting at atomy level

825
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,159
can help control its properties in terms

826
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,080
of the water harvesting and eventually

827
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,720
you know how to connect this you know

828
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,840
structural property relationship

829
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,480
actually all the way back to the device

830
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,320
level performance to maximize their you

831
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,960
know like real world applications in

832
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,679
terms of water output so the above

833
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,720
mentioning technology is actually has

834
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,760
turned into you know patterns and the

835
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,799
startup companies which is actively

836
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,880
working on expanding the use of mos to

837
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,360
address the global challenges and

838
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,960
provide the solution to the Water Crisis

839
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,280
so with that I would like to you know

840
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,280
express my thanks to my PhD advisor

841
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,000
Professor Omar yagi and Professor

842
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,280

843
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,879
Bros for their invaluable guidance I

844
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,000
would also like to thank you know my

845
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,760
labmates from the UC Berkeley and the

846
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,119
funding agencies for their support and

847
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,040
also I would like to thank you know the

848
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,159
MIT narrow exploration for these

849
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,440
wonderful opportunities to present my

850
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,159
you know PhD work here and finally I

851
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,960
would like to thank all of you for your

852
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,720
attention and being here and I'm looking

853
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,720
forward to the questions thank

854
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:43,679
you thank you Zach for AIC talk so um

855
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,280
that is now open for questions as I

856
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,720
mentioned earlier on you can ask

857
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,399
questions in the Q&A section uh which is

858
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,320
a special session that you can use for

859
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:55,480
webinars the chat or you could simply

860
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,520
raise your hand and we'll keep track of

861
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,520
of the hands I see that there already is

862
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,040
one and so

863
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,280
um so I'm going to read it to you uh

864
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,560
Zach uh when you discussed reflux

865
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,880
synthesis of MAF 303 using sodium

866
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,920
hydroxide does the addition of sodium

867
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,400
hydroxide and use of water show any

868
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,640
noticeable effect on poze structure and

869
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,240
performance that's actually a great

870
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,400
question thank you for uh uh thank you

871
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,320
for this question um so let me just go

872
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,680
back to this slide and I think you know

873
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,119
it's on the right side so the question

874
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,040
is about uh how you know like the choice

875
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,599
of you know the sodium hydroxide and the

876
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,520
water influence the you know I I think

877
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,880
the the pr size so I think you know my

878
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,119
uh we actually run some analysis in the

879
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,720
pr size distribution of the mob and was

880
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,040
actually very happy to find that you

881
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,440
know it just have a very consistent you

882
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,400
know in terms of the uh uh process

883
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,000
distribution as well as you know like

884
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,119
the uh uh performance which you know if

885
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,960
you can look at this you know uh Bett

886
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,079
surface area measurement so we uh at a

887
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,640
very early stage so we can actually run

888
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:07,960
L you know like calculation to you know

889
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,520
analyze their procise so they were both

890
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,000
you know very consistent you know in two

891
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,800
methods and but one F you know one

892
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,200
interesting observation we found that

893
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,280
actually you know if you slightly vary

894
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,000
the amount of the uh sodium hydroxide in

895
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,040
this case so you may like slightly

896
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
difference in terms of the uh particle

897
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,040
size of the M which is by about I think

898
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,480
like 10% to 30% you know depending on

899
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,240
like how how how much more sodium

900
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,920
hydroxide you use for instance if you

901
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,640
use 3.1 equivalent instead of three so

902
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,720
you may be expecting actually like a

903
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,560
slightly 10% smaller particle size for

904
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,040
this compound but overall you know when

905
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,040
we are uh measuring their you know uh

906
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,520
procity and water update so they behave

907
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,880
in a similar way the other thing is that

908
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,640
typically for water harvesting smaller

909
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,520
Pro size usually have like a slightly

910
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,760
stronger hesis so if you know you use

911
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,560
instead of you more sodium hydroxide so

912
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,720
compare with the original synthesis we

913
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,000
see that uh sometimes it may result in

914
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,319
certain H uh hesis which is undesirable

915
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,319
so that's why you know I I had some kind

916
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,680
of tra Arrow to make sure we use the

917
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,839
right amount of the sodium hydroxide so

918
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,240
I hope that answer that

919
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,520
question so the next question is how

920
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,160
will this device do in low temperatures

921
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,280
great question and in this case so

922
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,560
essentially the idea is that we want to

923
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,280
create a certain uh temperature

924
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,720
difference you know between the top and

925
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,560
the dot so obviously you know like there

926
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,240
there should be like a bottom limit for

927
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,160
this you know techn for instance you

928
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,520
cannot run this below zero otherwise you

929
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,359
know the water will just you know frozen

930
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,319
into the ice so that doesn't make any

931
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,200
sense but essentially you know in any

932
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:53,319
kind of you know like most conditions

933
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,839
that across the entire planet so you

934
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:56,880
know I will expect it you know you

935
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,480
around you know ambient temperature so

936
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,240
in this case you know we are still you

937
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,720
know creating like a temperature

938
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,880
difference because when the sunlight

939
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,319
hits the mo essentially you will just

940
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,000
try to increase it and once this kind of

941
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:10,599
temperature difference exists so you

942
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,920
will be able to still condense water uh

943
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:13,920
to into a drinkable

944
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:21,280
form um how much does it cost to build

945
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,800
one of those water harvesting devices

946
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,000
that you demonstrated in Death Valley

947
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,240
great question great question uh so for

948
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,160
the cor size uh for for the device uh

949
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:36,079
let me actually go back to the uh to the

950
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,640
the photo of the device so it has the

951
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,200
the most of the C come from two parts so

952
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,400
one is you know like the C we have to

953
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,240
synthesize the m so and the other part

954
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,599
is you know to customize you know this

955
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,040
device for the device part so for this

956
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,160
single device it takes about I think

957
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,319
$400 you know to just customize this you

958
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,640
know like Mo chamber as well as this

959
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:59,400
reflector so some of some of the parts

960
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,720
are actually 3D print which you know

961
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,640
adds up to the total cost and for the m

962
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,800
so I think you know over the past few

963
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,359
years so the price drops a lot because

964
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,839
you know just just as more and more

965
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:11,640
people are you know get involved into

966
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,800
use of this Linker so like people are

967
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,800
just reducing the uh price for this

968
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,160
precursor at a you know like Industrial

969
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Level and I think for this device if I

970
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,760
remember it correctly so the moth will

971
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,119
only cost about uh $100 to $200 which is

972
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,079
even you know cheaper than the the cost

973
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,560
for the device and the end of day I

974
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,960
think it totally adds up to about $500

975
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,960
to $700 each for this device but you

976
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,640
know like there is a startup company

977
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,880
that is currently you know

978
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,359
commercializing this this technology and

979
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,720
I think they are trying to reduce the

980
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,920
overall price and you know in my opinion

981
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,839
in a l in a l run so this can be you

982
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,000
know eventually goes down to be even

983
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,000
like a lower cost for the entire

984
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,599
device okay

985
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,520
and then the next one is what are the

986
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,960
stabilities of MAF under the cycles of

987
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,280
water uptake and

988
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,640
release okay great question uh in terms

989
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,760
of the stability so as I uh as I

990
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,560
mentioned previously I think I didn't

991
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,480
have like a figure for that but actually

992
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,760
we run like a 5,000 uh uh Circle testing

993
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,800
in terms of the uh uh stability and uh

994
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,960
once we you know run this you know uh

995
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,760
cycling experiments so we actually being

996
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,520
able to to see that you know the the m

997
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,640
still retains up to 95% of its water

998
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,359
update after this 5,000 cycle meaning

999
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,359
that you know they are still uh

1000
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,560
retaining their structural Integrity as

1001
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,920
well as the

1002
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,520
crystalinity uh so so pretty much I

1003
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,000
would say you know this MO is very

1004
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,240
stable you know under a lot of cycling

1005
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,880
experiments and then I have one more

1006
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,400
this is

1007
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,839
uh have you checked the MAF 303 water

1008
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,480
ABS absorption capacity

1009
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,000
after long-term testing yes yes so uh

1010
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,119
it's kind of relevant to a previous

1011
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,839
question so we actually run the you know

1012
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,160
like the aborption test after you know

1013
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:14,520
like 5,000 cycles and then so we realize

1014
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,800
that it retains about 95% of the uh uh

1015
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,599
capacity still after you know this such

1016
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,240
long you know uh kind of recycling

1017
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,920
experiment

1018
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,960
M and does the sunlight's angle of

1019
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,119
incidence have any effects on the volume

1020
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,240
of water output

1021
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:34,599
great question so in so so this is

1022
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,680
actually like a um like a special design

1023
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,000
we had for this you know device which

1024
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,319
you may notice that you know we

1025
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,400
intentionally use this cylindrical you

1026
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,560
know design which means when you are

1027
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,520
placing it you know on the ground so

1028
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,280
ideally you know let's say the sound

1029
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,119
raise from the East and as he travel you

1030
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,359
know to the top of head and finally you

1031
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,760
know like sunet on the other side

1032
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,359
essentially this cylindrical you know uh

1033
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,160
shape will allows you know allows us to

1034
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:02,000
maximize you know like the sunlight

1035
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,880
Radiance no matter you know which

1036
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,920
direction he you know end our Wass

1037
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,079
during the daytime and in this case so

1038
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,880
uh you know there is like no influence

1039
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,599
in terms of the angle but rather you

1040
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,560
know it will just consistently you know

1041
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,319
maximize the uh ingredients to heat up

1042
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:21,359
the uh the moth

1043
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:25,119
bed and why the use of the nickel foam

1044
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,040
plates oh great question so in this case

1045
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,680
uh so for the uh Nic I believe that uh

1046
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,920
there are uh two ways we we we use that

1047
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,640
one is that so overall uh we want to you

1048
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,319
know make sure you know like this uh

1049
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,800
this moths uh can kind of separate from

1050
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:47,920
each other so sometimes you know if you

1051
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,160
get uh all the mo just you know like uh

1052
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,559
uh all the moth B you know just having

1053
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,880
just only the mo so sometimes it cannot

1054
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,559
maximize the water it uptate so you need

1055
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,720
some kind of space in between each other

1056
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,359
but still you know uh you cannot just

1057
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,359
have it to be uh like a empty space just

1058
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,480
like you know thinking of the Oreo right

1059
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:08,280
so if you are want want to you know uh

1060
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,200
make sure you have the Oro so you have

1061
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,400
the white black white black thing and

1062
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,839
this you know like Nick form essentially

1063
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,839
are very poal so you still allow it to

1064
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,200
you know get water into it but they are

1065
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,599
actually not holding water but

1066
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,400
facilitating the their neighbors which

1067
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,880
is the uh moth bed to get water

1068
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,400
saturated well thank you I think we are

1069
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,119
uh out of time at this point it's

1070
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,880
exactly 11:45 and U that was a good set

1071
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,839
of questions so thank you very much

1072
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,520
that's for taking this giving this

1073
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:40,960
webinar thank you thank you car for

1074
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,880
hosting thank you to the participants

1075
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,680
for the active participation with

1076
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,680
questions and so on
