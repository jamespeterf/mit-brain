1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,520
Why don't we get started? Nice to see

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,400
you all. So, the thing I asked you to do

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,720
um in your learning journals for today

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,000
um was to do a little reflection on your

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,320
personal edtech history. Um so what are

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
tools,

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,480
experiences, platforms, systems that

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,480
either had some like very positive

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,840
effect on your learning trajectory? You

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,239
like discovered a love of something

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,719
because you did that or were terrible

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,320
and disastrous. They ruined your

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,640
learning experience. They made you feel

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
bad. They inhibited your learning in

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
some way or they were just interesting

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,399
or engaging or or useless or some other

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,079
way distinctive. Um, go ahead and now if

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,600
you didn't do that assignment, you can

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,520
probably still make up an answer to that

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,079
question. So, you'll be okay for today.

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
Um, um, but turn to the the person or

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,719
two next to you, get in small groups and

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,159
just share a little bit with each other

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,360
about this little like snippet of your

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,479
personal edtech history and we'll do

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,320
that for five minutes or so and then

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,320
share out. Does that make sense? Ready?

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Go.

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
Did um

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,680
did did anybody happen to be in a group

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,600
where multiple people in the group

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
mention the same thing? Were they all

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,720
different? What were the most similar

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,159
ones? Anybody? Uh there was a computer

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,840
literacy class like similarity. Okay,

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
good. So there's like a class which is

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
called like computer literacy, digital

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
literacy, and it's kind of like a pretty

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
like here's how to use PowerPoint.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,640
Here's how to type. Here's how to um do

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
like pretty simple things with

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
computers. Good. Yeah, that's a feature

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,200
of of a lot of different kinds of uh

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,360
school systems. And was it successful in

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
your environments or was it a drag?

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
truck.

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,360
Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,040
Yeah. You know, um there there can be

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
there can be a bias of like, oh man, we

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
got to like put technology in the

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
schools because the kids are going to be

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
really fired up about the technology in

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
the school. No, actually like if you do

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,799
boring things with technology, they're

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,039
just as bored as sometimes even more so.

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,120
Um anybody have things that were like

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,560
really positive experiences for them

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,400
that somebody that you or somebody in

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
your group talked about things you're

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
like, "Yeah, that was that was great.

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
That really made school better?" Well, I

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,319
mean, I I talked about like the

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,760
Smartboard and just like the

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,440
implementation of it and like every

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,160
classroom I feel like especially as like

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,520
our generation was growing up. Um, and

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,680
like I don't know like I made like a

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
little like side story about how like

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,879
that's the first time I felt like the

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,959
students became the teacher because the

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,959
old ladies at our schools like didn't

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
know how to like recalibrate it or like

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
turn it all on. So, it was always the

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
students like coming up and showing the

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
teacher how to use it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Good. The sort of inversion of of

77
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
expertise. How many how many of you were

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
in schools where smartboards just kind

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,879
of appeared in the middle of your

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
educational trajectory? Yeah, you all

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
are like in this sweet spot. How how

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
many of you would would say that they

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,560
were anybody at schools where you felt

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
like they were very effective where they

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
substantially improved learning? How you

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
thought yours good? How many of you were

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
at schools where like this is like no

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
one is using these things? They could

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
have just bought chalkboards or

90
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,680
whiteboards or things like that. Yeah.

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
So overwhelming majority of that. Yeah.

92
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
Smartboards are like a totally

93
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
fascinating case study. um a a vast

94
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,720
amount of money was spent on these

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,879
tools. Um uh that that seemed to have

96
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
essentially no positive impact at all on

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
learning. In lots of places, they really

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,560
weren't used as like interactive

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,640
whiteboards. They were just like, oh,

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,599
like a a whiteboard. You know, we Khalil

101
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,799
and I were joking that uh um that they

102
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
actually didn't work very well in his

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
school in particular because they

104
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
require like slightly different

105
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,720
lighting. Um like like you need to dim

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
the lights a little bit to be able to

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,440
see them. But the, you know, the

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,720
classrooms they were built were not

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,000
built for dimmable lights. They were

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
built for lights that would be shined on

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
whiteboards or chalkboards. Um, and so

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,200
like the rest of the there's a whole

113
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
bunch of the rest of the infrastructure

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,080
that didn't make Smartboards work. Like

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,360
maybe your classroom didn't work. Maybe

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
there was no training for your teacher.

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,159
Maybe there were no curricular materials

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
that were available to integrate with

119
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,200
the Smartboard.

120
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Um, and yet, you know, like like how is

121
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
it the case that that we could be in a

122
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,560
room full of people all across country,

123
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,080
all across the world, you all raise your

124
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
hand or like we all bought smartboards

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
and they all didn't work. Um, like why

126
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
like why didn't the first people who

127
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,000
bought smartboards be like team this is

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
not a good idea? Like spend your money

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,639
on something else. You know, every

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,360
dollar we spend on education technology

131
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,199
has an opportunity cost. Um, every time

132
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
you spend a dollar in a school, you're

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,880
trying to make people's learning better.

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,400
Um, and there there are very few dollars

135
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
that we spend that make learning worse.

136
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,520
Does anybody feel like the smartboard

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
like actively like made you dumber or

138
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,320
learn slower or something like that?

139
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,000
Probably not. Like probably your smart

140
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
like it's probably the case that no one

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
none of you were harmed by smartboards.

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
I think that's pretty unlikely. Um, but

143
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
every dollar your school your school

144
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
spent on smartboards could have been

145
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
spent on some other technology, on some

146
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,160
other curriculum material, on art

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
supplies, on professional development

148
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
for teachers, on a zillion other things

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,720
which could have improved your learning

150
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,520
experience, um, and not just been like a

151
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,919
very expensive version of a whiteboard

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,600
or something like that. Um so there's a

153
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
lot in that discussion of smartboards

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,120
that I think is helpful for us to think

155
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,280
about um how you know not just not just

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
of the efficacy of any particular techn

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
you know it's the efficacy of any

158
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
particular technology how particular

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
technology um is situated in different

160
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
kind of places at least one example from

161
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
Dana who's like no these things are

162
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
great you know like we bought them our

163
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
teachers got trained with them students

164
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
were able to help use them like it

165
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
worked in that one context even if

166
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,320
almost universally it didn't work in

167
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
these other contexts so those are all

168
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
things we're going to have to unpack and

169
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,400
figure out and then we're also going to

170
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,440
sort of answer this question like if

171
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
there's this thing which like

172
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
overwhelmingly doesn't work um why did

173
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,639
schools spend so much money on it like

174
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,400
what would what were the incentives what

175
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
was the logic who was spending this

176
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
money um all these kinds of things are

177
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,360
questions we can keep asking um anybody

178
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
have like really like disastrous stories

179
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
though that's kind of like a benol like

180
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
weird that thing didn't work but anybody

181
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
have a like man this was terrible kind

182
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,720
of experience with technology

183
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,520
Okay. Uh to our smartboard. Uh in one

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,280
case, students were able to install like

185
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,479
so they can customize the brushes and

186
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,880
the student just chose like kind of an

187
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,440
awful picture of a teacher to put as a

188
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,319
brush and they used as a kind of a prank

189
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,080
on them which is you know technology

190
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,600
allows you to do more creative pranks.

191
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Good. Yeah. Yeah. So, so expand

192
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
expanding our way of humiliating

193
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
faculty. That could be one good. In

194
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,800
seventh grade, my school decided to give

195
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,240
everyone a Chromebook. But in seventh

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
grade, I feel like everyone is not

197
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
really mature. So, in class, like

198
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
everyone would find a different game. It

199
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
was like the snake IO game or like the

200
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
paint IO and the entire class would be

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,800
on the game like while the teacher was

202
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
teaching. So, then they would have to

203
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
block different websites. But like a new

204
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,600
website would appear every week. So,

205
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
they just had to keep blocking more and

206
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,280
more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, block

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
like blocking websites is a good way to

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,240
teach young people how to use VPNs. Like

209
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,919
if you were like I want to teach young

210
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,919
people how to use VPNs and like blocking

211
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,919
websites is pretty good. But but in ter

212
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,280
I I wrote an oped once years and years

213
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,440
ago. Um I pro like just after I was

214
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,039
teaching probably 2006 or seven or

215
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,479
something like that. Um where I

216
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,919
described them as kneeh high fences

217
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
around the internet that that adults

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,240
trip over and and young people just jump

219
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,680
over. Um uh um good. Yeah. So here so

220
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
here's this tool which actually now is

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
like Chromebooks are pretty ubiquitous

222
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,440
in schools. Um there are plenty of

223
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
places where there's push back against

224
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
the these kinds of technology for like

225
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,960
people telling just the story that you

226
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,000
described like like you know our devices

227
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,599
are canonically designed to capture our

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,360
attention as much as possible and to

229
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,319
particularly like capture our attention

230
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
in ways that have us look at

231
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,520
advertisements like you know for people

232
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
who are designing phones and computers

233
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
and websites and things like that that

234
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,400
is like a central focus like how do we

235
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,759
get you looking at this thing as much as

236
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
possible and in particular like how do

237
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,560
we then get advertisements to slide in

238
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
front of these things so that people

239
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
will pay you to look at us. that is not

240
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
a set of characteristics that are good

241
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,319
for a learning environment. Um, but on

242
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
the other hand, we could I'm sure and

243
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,199
some of you may have mentioned them, but

244
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
we we can go to schools where

245
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
Chromebooks are implemented and the kids

246
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,639
are not playing snake IO all day because

247
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,400
they're doing like interesting learning

248
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,840
activities that are well supervised that

249
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,360
would not be possible without the

250
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,639
Chromebook, without the apps, without

251
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
the access to the internet and things

252
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,199
like that. So we could also think about

253
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,240
like what happened in your school um

254
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,160
that had this kind of purchase and then

255
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,919
there there was clearly not the rest of

256
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
the infrastructure in place to have that

257
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,520
purchase be meaningful whereas the exact

258
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,039
same purpose in other places was

259
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,399
supported by professional learning and

260
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
curriculum and like all the other things

261
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,399
that might have potentially made that a

262
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,719
valuable learning experience.

263
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,479
Um, so I was talking to her and I think

264
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
we had a bit of a different experience

265
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
from most of the people in the class

266
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,560
because we didn't do like our basic

267
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,399
learning in the US. So it's from

268
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,880
Ethiopia, I'm from Brazil. I think we

269
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,519
use technology to a much lesser expense

270
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,959
extent than here. Um, so I remember

271
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
there was like one significant

272
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
experience for me in terms of using

273
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,440
technology growing up which is going to

274
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,519
media lab to do English classes. Mhm.

275
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,519
Um, and I think it comes to your point

276
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,240
of like having a purpose to having

277
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
technology and that was very clear like

278
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
you can't really do listening and

279
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,080
speaking exercises unless you know you

280
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
actually have something to listen to and

281
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,279
something to repeat and like each person

282
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
would have time with their booth where

283
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,360
they could practice by themselves. Mhm.

284
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,880
So I think the fact that it was very

285
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,160
purposeful um and that it changed from

286
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
the day to day because I think also

287
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,680
there's an aspect of like we're going to

288
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,720
computer lab we're doing something

289
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,120
different floors and it was a different

290
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,959
scene with like different lighting like

291
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
the fact that it's different made it

292
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,480
much more interesting and when

293
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,200
technology gets to this very common

294
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,920
place you don't even you take it for

295
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,560
granted like you don't really value all

296
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,320
that it can bring so yeah we discuss a

297
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,600
little I mean those kind of language

298
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,880
classes are a great example of this. I

299
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
know you probably all have taken

300
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,399
language classes where like the teacher

301
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
goes around and you like each say hello

302
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,680
to the teacher in the foreign language

303
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
and it takes like 10 minutes to let

304
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
everyone say hello. Once you all went to

305
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,959
your individual booths and you could

306
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,800
imagine designing technology where every

307
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
person simultaneously says hello and

308
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
some algorithm evaluates whether or not

309
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,959
you say hello correctly and then you

310
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,080
know it says something back to you and

311
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,160
other kinds of things. You're like wow

312
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,920
wow we each are getting our own teacher

313
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
um that maybe isn't as good as the human

314
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,680
teacher but all of us get one at the

315
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,399
same time. That's pretty cool. I would

316
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,240
say like adding I think to what you said

317
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,360
with purpose it's also like you went

318
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,680
there to do the like English practice it

319
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,519
wasn't used for any extraneous reasons

320
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
something like with like Chromebooks

321
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
like I have a younger sister who's in

322
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
high school right now and all her

323
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,000
homework has to be submitted on like

324
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,760
canvas or something and then she also

325
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,680
just loves like watching YouTube and

326
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,079
stuff and then my mom's problem is like

327
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,519
I can't remove her technology or limit

328
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
her technology because that limits her

329
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,160
school work so what do you like you

330
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,160
can't control her like what she's doing

331
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,959
on the Not only that but the vast

332
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,600
majority of our how we learn to be

333
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,640
parents is by observing our own parents

334
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,519
um and this gener you know you know

335
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
parents of roughly my age younger um

336
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,560
certainly the next generation coming

337
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,160
along um we can't turn to our own

338
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,920
childhood examples to figure out how to

339
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,600
navigate something like this um it's

340
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,200
very difficult to come up with like good

341
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,800
parenting strategies from first

342
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
principles you're like a professional

343
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,519
parent or professional caregiver getting

344
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
training or other things like that like

345
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,120
what are you supposed to do? Um and uh

346
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,160
no it's a I I think a lot of school you

347
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,200
know schoolwide infrastructure has a

348
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,480
bunch of unintended consequences. Um the

349
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
idea that like at night we're going to

350
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,920
lock kids into their devices you know

351
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
like that you know it and and it can

352
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,680
also different differ by kids. So for

353
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
kids who have like really good executive

354
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,160
function who can be like I'm going to do

355
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
all my homework and then watch the

356
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
YouTube videos like maybe there's cool

357
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,720
different things that we could do with

358
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
the computers but for kids who are like

359
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,560
you know yeah it's weird like do do

360
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,640
homework on the machine which always has

361
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,240
YouTube on it like literally you're one

362
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,160
click away from really fun things all

363
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
the time but like you know do your

364
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,640
quadratic equations really um it's nuts

365
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
right like like there must be millions

366
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,959
of kids who cannot like are not good at

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,480
that. Yeah, I think kind of to add on

368
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,200
that fact, so I also went to an

369
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
international school in Ethiopia and uh

370
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,959
it was a really interesting experience

371
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
of how rules around technology would

372
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,279
change almost like on a weekly basis at

373
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
some point. It was like at some point

374
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,160
like you can't use any social media and

375
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,600
then like phones were banned and then

376
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
they're like, "Oh, like if you need to

377
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
call your parents though, you can't call

378
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
them." And then it was like limited time

379
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
and then like VPNs came and then it was

380
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,040
like it's always so interesting of how

381
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
like teachers and faculty would always

382
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
try to make like new rules and each time

383
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
like they would have to get broken or

384
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,279
like something would have to change and

385
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,040
I think it was always like almost like a

386
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,880
comedy show of how much like it changed

387
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,639
throughout the time. Um uh when when uh

388
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
internet filters were first widely

389
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,360
introduced in schools, one of the

390
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,279
problems came up is the vice president

391
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
at the time was a guy named Dick Cheney.

392
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,480
Um, and uh, and there are a lot of

393
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,600
searches that were filtering out Dick.

394
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,680
Um, but you need to figure out about

395
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
Dick Cheney. Um, so then, you know, like

396
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
like someone sets a rule, the rule isn't

397
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,040
right for the context. Um, GPT is

398
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
another set of things right now that

399
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
people are doing with tons of rules

400
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,240
about these. These are good things.

401
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,680
We're going to keep talking about them.

402
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
I'll take a break here so that we can

403
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,480
move on to some other things. You all

404
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,000
have valuable case study experiences

405
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
from your time in schools that we can

406
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,360
bring into our conversations together to

407
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,240
think about what um uh you know how new

408
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,560
technologies operate.

409
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,720
To do a good job of making sense of

410
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,000
technologies um we need to understand a

411
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,600
little bit about how people learn. So

412
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,760
we're going to spend two classes looking

413
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
at two um pretty well-established

414
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,279
contemporary philosophies, pedagogies,

415
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
sciences about learning. Um, today you

416
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,360
read a bunch about cognitive load

417
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
theory. Um, I'm going to ask you to do

418
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,160
another exercise actually in the same

419
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,720
groups that you were in would probably

420
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,120
be fine for this one. Um, I want you to

421
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,440
draw a visual

422
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,120
representation of what the authors of

423
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
the cognitive learning of of the

424
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,839
cognitive learning theory articles you

425
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,000
read and other things call human

426
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,560
cognitive architecture. um like what are

427
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,920
the key sort of components of the brain

428
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,959
of thinking um of memory in order to

429
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,000
have learning happen. Um another thing

430
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,680
that you could draw in this visual

431
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,240
representation is based on this human

432
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,240
cognitive architecture um there follows

433
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
a series of instructional principles.

434
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
There follows a series of like better

435
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,560
and worse ways to teach people. Um, and

436
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,839
so you could also try to illustrate how

437
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,440
this human cognitive architecture um,

438
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,600
uh, leads to different kinds of

439
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
instructional principles. So groups can

440
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,880
either, um, go and take a chunk of

441
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,440
whiteboard and use some of those

442
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
whiteboard markers or part of why I'm

443
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
doing this is just I really like this

444
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
paper, but it kind of got folded. Um, so

445
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,160
I just want to get rid of it. Um, but

446
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,680
you can take one of these and sort of

447
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,839
huddle around on one of the tables and

448
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,360
and draw. So if you're if you're a paper

449
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,800
person, you can draw on these and then

450
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,639
stick them up there in a few minutes. If

451
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,079
you're a whiteboard person, um you can

452
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,680
do that. We still have all these markers

453
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,279
here. Um I haven't given you um totally

454
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
clear instructions in part because what

455
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,120
I want you to do is to um figure out how

456
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
to think through some of this uh on your

457
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
own a bit. But get in your groups, talk

458
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,560
with each other about what you think are

459
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,399
sort of the key components of cognitive

460
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,880
load theory and the human cognitive

461
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,560
architecture that sort of leads to um

462
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
cognitive load theory. And don't go more

463
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,639
than like 2 minutes before starting to

464
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,680
put pen to paper. um it, you know,

465
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,800
you're not going to be graded on whether

466
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,199
or not you're right, but let's see if we

467
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,639
can get a couple of different

468
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:30,000
representations of uh of what these

469
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,760
folks are talking about, how people

470
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
learn, and based on how people learn,

471
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,560
how should we instruct them? Does that

472
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,079
give me enough to start messing around

473
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,079
for a little bit? Ready, go.

474
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,639
All right. What you've seen a couple of

475
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,959
these now. What are some like what are

476
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,959
the main building blocks of this model

477
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,759
of a brain? What is the key features of

478
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,199
human cognitive architecture?

479
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,880
I feel like almost everyone had like

480
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,800
working memory and long-term memory.

481
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,959
Okay, two big pieces here that are

482
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,079
important. Working memory and long-term

483
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,120
memory. What are some of the

484
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,120
characteristics of long-term memory?

485
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,959
It's cool. There are different schemas

486
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,399
stored inside of long-term memory. Okay.

487
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,440
So, we we store stuff in blocks. We want

488
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,399
to talk some more about what these

489
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,440
schemas are. That seems important. It's

490
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,880
kind of limitless. It's limitless. That

491
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,440
is bonkers. No one has discovered the

492
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,759
boundaries of the amount of stuff you

493
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
can store in the human brain. You like

494
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
you have a finite amount of space. Like

495
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
you have a finite number of ounces. You

496
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,560
have a finite number of neurons. There's

497
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
a lot of them, but a finite number. And

498
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,920
as far as we can tell, there are no

499
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,720
known limits to how much stuff you can

500
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,639
store inside your brain. That's amazing.

501
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
That is an amazing feature of your

502
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,399
brain. Um, anything else that seems

503
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,079
important about long-term memory? All

504
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
the stuff can be there. How cool.

505
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,040
It's also unconscious.

506
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You you yeah you you cannot think about

507
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,399
all those things at the same time. It is

508
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,959
it is unconscious. Um how long does

509
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,959
stuff stay in

510
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,480
there? It falls out, right? You forget

511
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,760
stuff. Like if you're interested in

512
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
learning, the fact that you forget

513
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,919
things is really important. Um so stuff

514
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,600
goes into longterm memory. It leaks out

515
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,520
into long-term memory. Some of the very

516
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,439
earliest experiments in psychology done

517
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,439
by a guy named Ebing House um were about

518
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,959
the forgetting curve. Um it was

519
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,240
psychology experiments that were mostly

520
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,400
as I understand he mostly did by

521
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
himself. He basically like tried to

522
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,440
remember stuff and then tested himself

523
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,640
and then saw how often he forgot things

524
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,840
and noticed that there were sort of

525
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,280
mathematical properties to the

526
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,400
forgetting curve and things like that.

527
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,120
All right. Long-term memory um it's uh

528
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,039
it's functionally limitless. Um it's

529
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,200
unconscious so we can't directly access

530
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,520
it. um we can put things of different

531
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,320
levels of complexity in there. Um what

532
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,679
schemas do is allow us to sort of uh um

533
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,280
aggregate information elements into more

534
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,480
and more complex kind of things. What

535
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,480
are some of the key features of working

536
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,480
memory?

537
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,280
Very limited. Very limited. But how many

538
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,640
things can you hold in your working

539
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,000
memory in any given time, give or take?

540
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
Maybe this article didn't emphasize it.

541
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,880
Most people know this. It's kind of like

542
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,440
a fact that that is out there in the

543
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,960
world. Like seven. Yeah. Uh for a long

544
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,400
time people thought it was seven. A

545
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
better guess seems to be even less than

546
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,919
that. Three to five. Um but somewhere in

547
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
the very you know so here's another

548
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,960
beautiful thing about like you all come

549
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,320
from all different parts of the world.

550
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,760
You can look around this room and you

551
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,880
can see that you're different in all

552
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
kinds of ways. You have different

553
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
genders. You have different skin color,

554
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
different hair color, different eye

555
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,880
color. All kind. All of you have

556
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,120
essentially the exact same working

557
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,280
memory. All of you can hold three to

558
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,240
five things in your head. Um it doesn't

559
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,520
seem to decline as you age. Like there's

560
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,880
other problems with aging, things like

561
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
that, but people of all different ages,

562
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,520
everyone, every human you will ever

563
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,480
meet, the eight billion people on this

564
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,160
planet, they can all hold three to five

565
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,919
things in their working memory at any

566
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,039
given time. It is like a beautiful thing

567
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,960
that unites all people on Earth is this

568
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,840
common feature of cognitive

569
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,480
architecture.

570
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,320
Um, how do you how do you how do you get

571
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,240
or like like what are the what are the

572
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,919
things in working memory? How do you get

573
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
them or access them or do something with

574
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,640
them?

575
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
I was going to say like as much as we

576
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,360
can only hold like three to five things

577
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,720
like those things you can say like are

578
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,520
like schemas and like they can be super

579
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,360
complex and that's how you're able to

580
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,039
like solve really hard problems. So as

581
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,960
much as like like the example of the

582
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,039
restaurant like you have like the chairs

583
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,640
and the tables that's like the basic

584
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,000
things and like the food that you eat

585
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,360
and the workers like all these things

586
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
make up a restaurant which are like

587
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,840
super confusing but your working memory

588
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,400
just knows it as this like really large

589
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,559
like one object and so in your working

590
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
memory's mind that's only one thing but

591
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,160
it's really a compilation of like

592
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,720
hundreds of things. Yeah. Good. So we

593
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,840
could organize sub things into larger

594
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,520
things in schema. The reason why we're

595
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,280
using imprecise words I would say is in

596
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,679
part like you know this is not the

597
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,799
revealed you know word of the creator

598
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,400
about your brain this is like the best

599
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,480
models we can come up with and our

600
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,160
models aren't perfect like what exactly

601
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,919
is a thing in working memory I think

602
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,679
it's a little bit sketchy how much our

603
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,280
understanding of that is however even

604
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,640
with sketchy models like we can still do

605
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,240
useful things on let's do a quick

606
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,400
working memory exercise do any of you

607
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
speak

608
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,200
Sanskrit oh wait I can't do I can't show

609
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,480
you this just yet well here's Uh,

610
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
actually, I'll do these first and then

611
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,679
I'll show you this next thing. Um, grab

612
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
a piece of paper and a pen. You can, if

613
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
you don't have a piece of paper and a

614
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,360
pen, you can um pass that around. Um,

615
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,360
here are two that I really like.

616
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,760
Um, this one I think illustrates really

617
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,120
nicely the idea that the working memory

618
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,559
is the bottleneck. If you are an

619
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,200
educator, one of the main things you're

620
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,360
working against is people's limited

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,280
working memory. If people had huge

622
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,960
working memories, you could like tell

623
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,240
them all kinds of complex things. You

624
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
could be like, "Let me just explain

625
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
everything and they would be

626
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,480
like,"Great, now it's all in my

627
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,720
long-term memory." Um, but you actually

628
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,960
can't do that. People can only attend to

629
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,480
a small number of things at any given

630
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,919
time. And for noviceses, those things

631
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
that they attend to are necessarily

632
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,039
going to be simpler than for more

633
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
complex people. So, so for the for the

634
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,000
people in cognitive load theory, um, as

635
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,679
they think about instructional

636
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,320
environments, the the bottleneck of

637
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,080
those instructional environments is the

638
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
limits of your working memory. Anybody

639
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,679
anybody read the Sweller article?

640
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,760
Anybody remember how um uh how cognitive

641
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,120
load theory got started to begin with?

642
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,120
What was the sort of canonical

643
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,880
experiment that got that got John

644
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,360
Sweller kicked off onto cognitive load

645
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,440
theory? You like making a students do

646
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,760
like some kind of weird math like adding

647
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,919
and subtracting and multiplying multiple

648
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,840
things. Yeah. Yeah. So, you solve a math

649
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,200
problem. You're given number A and

650
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,799
number B. And there's only two

651
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
operations you can do. It's something

652
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
like you can multiply by three or

653
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
subtract 69. Those numbers aren't

654
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,640
exactly right. But those are the only

655
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,840
two operations you can do. And somehow

656
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
you have to get from number the first

657
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
number he gives you to the second number

658
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,840
he gives you. People do multiple forms

659
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,080
of this problem. It turns out that in

660
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,640
every every solution is always

661
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,280
alternating between these two things. Um

662
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,280
add 69 multiply by 3 add 69 multiply by

663
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,440
3 add 69 multiply by three. Nobody

664
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,960
notices

665
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,120
this. None of the people in maybe not

666
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,960
none very few people in the experiments

667
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,760
notice this pattern. This is deeply

668
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,080
troubling for John Sweller because John

669
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,000
Sweller is in a moment in math education

670
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,679
where people are like really big on

671
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,520
problem solving, really big on

672
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,000
discovery, really big on intuition. And

673
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,919
he's like, "My guys, people are not

674
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,280
induced inducing the key principle

675
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,280
that's here. Like they're doing a kind

676
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,799
of mathematical operation, but they're

677
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,159
not figuring out the important thing

678
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,000
here." Like think about how much

679
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
consequences that has for math

680
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,240
instruction. it's, you know, they're

681
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,480
solving the problems correctly without

682
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,400
understanding some key feature about how

683
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,280
you solve them correctly. That's bad for

684
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,720
mathematics instruction. Um, and then he

685
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,120
comes up with this theory like why

686
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,520
weren't they able to do that? Um, and he

687
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,440
he describes it as um that people do

688
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,559
this thing he calls means and analysis.

689
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,159
They're constantly looking where they

690
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,919
are and thinking about what would get

691
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
them to the next step. Um, if you're

692
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,880
constantly thinking about where you are,

693
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,320
where you want to be, and what might the

694
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,159
next step is, those are like three

695
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,520
things to block up your working memory.

696
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,039
And so now you don't have a whole lot of

697
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,400
working memory left. And it turn you

698
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,679
know his theory was that people like

699
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
essentially filled up their working

700
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,360
memory. Their working memory was like at

701
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,000
capacity. It had overwhel there was too

702
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,840
much cognitive load too much cognitive

703
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
load on the working memory. And so they

704
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,360
couldn't figure out this underlying

705
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,039
principle. Um and so swellers, you know,

706
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,400
and then he just gets fascinated for the

707
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,159
rest of his life about thinking about

708
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,320
what is the human cognitive architecture

709
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,919
like where is the cognitive load, where

710
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
are we overburdened, where are their

711
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
bottlenecks, and what would be

712
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,760
instructional designs that would help us

713
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,679
relieve those bottlenecks, work around

714
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,559
those bottlenecks. Um in particular,

715
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320
really skeptical of this idea, um that

716
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,520
you just like give a bunch of novices

717
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,520
stuff and they can kind of figure it out

718
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,039
on their own. um you know with enough

719
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,200
time, enough exploration, things like

720
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
that. Um so that's a bottleneck here

721
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,840
that I really like. And I really like

722
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,200
this picture that has this sort of

723
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,640
infinite long-term memory. I mean, in

724
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,960
theory, it should just go up forever,

725
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,440
but it's big enough that works. Um a

726
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,559
nice thing about this one um on the side

727
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
is it notes that the where does where

728
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,840
does stuff get into working memory? Kind

729
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,760
of from two places. You can pull it out

730
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,799
of long-term memory. You can remember

731
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,640
stuff and then you can put it

732
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,120
temporarily in long-term memory. Or you

733
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,799
can attend to it. You can see things in

734
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
your environment. You can watch stuff.

735
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,760
You can read things. You can listen to

736
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,279
people and talk to people. As I'm

737
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,799
explaining things to you now, you're

738
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,760
taking these constructs and to the

739
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
extent that you're listening and

740
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,120
attending to them, you're putting them

741
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,960
in your working memory. Um, if we mess

742
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,880
around with them enough, if we get you

743
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,919
to apply them, think about them, if you

744
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,520
write them down, some other stuff like

745
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,600
that, it will eventually get stored in

746
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,360
your long-term memory. Um, and then

747
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,679
there's this nice piece here that like

748
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,200
stuff sort of not only goes from working

749
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
memory to long-term memory, but things

750
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,679
kind of fall out um and get forgotten.

751
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,919
And yeah, you know, I I think pairing

752
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,520
these words together, um, when stuff in

753
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,880
working memory gets stored in your

754
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,279
long-term memory, they call that

755
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
learning. When stuff, um, in long-term

756
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,919
memory gets put into your working

757
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,440
memory, when you become conscious of it,

758
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,159
we call that remembering. That's kind of

759
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,919
nice way of sort of summarizing that.

760
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,039
Um, there

761
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,360
are one of uh, in this model, um,

762
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,919
everything that you learn essentially is

763
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,200
kind of a fact that you remember. Um

764
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,640
there's a great quote by Daniel

765
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,039
Willingham who's a psychologist that

766
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,240
memory is the residue of thought. Um

767
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,919
when you think about stuff that you

768
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,520
remember and and in this model people

769
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,559
tend to think of the things you remember

770
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,880
as discrete facts. Um you can probably

771
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,760
think about and the accumulation of

772
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,120
those discrete facts is what leads to

773
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,360
expertise that understanding um is in a

774
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,360
sense uh the accumulation of lots of

775
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,679
these facts. there probably some domains

776
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,679
that you could think about um where that

777
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,279
model feels really good and makes sense

778
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
like oh man you're like man that person

779
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,799
is a really good economist because they

780
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,640
just like know a ton of stuff about

781
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,640
economies and they know a ton of facts

782
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,480
about economics and they remember lots

783
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,000
of different

784
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,240
calculations that you know like would

785
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,480
you say that Maya Angelo was a great

786
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,320
poet because she had way more facts than

787
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
other poets do that seems like a sort of

788
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
unsatisfying description of how people

789
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,039
become great poets but something to sort

790
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
of wrestle with and think about a little

791
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,400
bit okay you have your piece paper with

792
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,159
you. Um, I'm going to show you a

793
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,520
phrase and I want you I want you to copy

794
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,320
down I'm going to show it to you for

795
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,440
about 10 seconds. So, hold your pens up

796
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
in the air. You're going to look at this

797
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,559
thing for 10 seconds and then I'm going

798
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,080
to take it off the screen and I want you

799
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,760
to copy it down. Okay,

800
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,640
ready? I want you to copy this down.

801
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:39,120
Look at it. Memorize it. Look at it.

802
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,159
Five. Four. Three. Just this row. You

803
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,559
don't have to do that one. Just this row

804
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,520
in the middle. Two. one. All right, copy

805
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,520
down as much of that as you

806
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,799
can. All right. And three, two,

807
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,480
one. Everybody, everybody hold up what

808
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,600
you did. Show it to each other. How'd

809
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,400
you do? Oh, man. These are these are a

810
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,760
little bit disappointing. All right,

811
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
let's do let's do a second one. Let's do

812
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,799
a second one. Let's see if you can do

813
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,320
any better than this. All right, I'll

814
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,960
help you. You might feel better about

815
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,120
this one. I'm going to give you a set of

816
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,400
writing now that has roughly the same

817
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,919
number of marks in it. It's not the

818
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,200
exact same number of marks. But one,

819
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,960
like one of the things we could do to

820
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,640
calculate how difficult this is, is to

821
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
just like count the number of marks on

822
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
the screen. I'm going to give you

823
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
another thing like this with roughly the

824
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,720
same number of marks. Let's see if you

825
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,240
can do any better. Uh, I want you to

826
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,799
look at this and then get ready to copy

827
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:42,400
it down. This English phrase in the

828
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:45,919
middle. Ready? Five, four, three, two,

829
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,919
one. Okay, copy it

830
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,159
down. Oh, you're finished

831
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,000
already. You're really good at that.

832
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,440
Nice. Good. Um,

833
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,559
uh, why why were you so much better at

834
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,960
this one?

835
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,120
Yeah. Yeah. Th you have those squiggles

836
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,120
are organized into schema. When you were

837
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,320
very very young, you observed these

838
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,600
English letters. Actually, if you

839
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
learned English in the middle of your

840
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
life, whenever you started learning

841
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
English, um like just now, you observed

842
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,919
these Sanskrit letters. You know, for

843
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,000
those of you who are native English

844
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,240
speakers, you can't remember the time

845
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,919
probably in which like there would be no

846
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,279
distinguish distinction between English

847
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,760
letters and Sanskrit letters. So, when

848
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,039
you were copying down Sanskrit, none of

849
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,760
this has any meaning to you. So you're

850
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,240
like literally memorizing the order in

851
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,919
which these lines appear. Um which is

852
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,279
really hard because there are lots of

853
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,399
those lines. There's about the same

854
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,840
number of lines. I haven't actually

855
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,520
measured this but it's take take for

856
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,840
grant it's close. Um but um you know

857
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,039
that that two combinations of line is an

858
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,120
L. And you know that an L and E and a T

859
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,640
is a word let. That has some kind of

860
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,240
meaning and you can actually like let

861
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,000
the entire world be happy. Even sort of

862
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,840
bundle that into kind of a phrase that

863
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
you can memorize in your head. And so

864
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,000
copying down that number of things is

865
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,720
trivial because this is organized in

866
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,120
your head in a in like a tightly bundled

867
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,559
schema in a way that you have no schema

868
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,520
for understanding these kinds of things.

869
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,799
Probably like the first thing you

870
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,080
started putting in your schema was like

871
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,200
well there's a line that goes across

872
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
there and then a bunch of things that

873
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
drop down after that. I don't know

874
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
anything about sanscript so does that

875
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,840
give you is that an illustration of like

876
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,919
how schema operates in your mind? um

877
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,919
this completely overwhelms your working

878
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,240
memory efforts because you have to

879
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,399
recall the orientation of each

880
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,640
individual line to be able to copy it.

881
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,080
Um this does not at all do that um

882
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
because you've already bundled those

883
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
lines into schema. Um another famous

884
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,640
example which I think is written about

885
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,120
um is that chess masters um when chess

886
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,360
masters look at a chessboard they can

887
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,279
they like all the pieces they can

888
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,039
remember easily all of the pieces in

889
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,799
their arrangements because if you know

890
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,320
nothing about chess like me you have to

891
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:02,000
be like okay the pawn is in the second

892
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,520
row black square um and the king is in

893
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,600
the first row white square and the

894
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,120
bishop kind of moved over here but

895
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,360
that's not what chess masters are doing

896
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,360
chess masters are going like, oh, that's

897
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,720
the, you know, the the Turkish Armada

898
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,159
gambit or something like that. And

899
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
they've sort of bundled all of those

900
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,240
positions together into one thing. So,

901
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,640
even though we can only attend to three

902
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,919
to five things at any given time, um,

903
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,000
those three to five things can be

904
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,440
enormously complex. Um, and that's what

905
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,520
lets us think about complex and

906
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,799
difficult things. Okay, that piece of

907
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,320
schema makes sense for you? Um, all

908
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,760
right. So, these are these are some

909
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,200
pretty good fundamental models of human

910
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,360
cognitive architecture kinds of things.

911
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,960
Anybody want to ask any questions or

912
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,480
make any observations about some of

913
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,039
these key elements, how our brains work?

914
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,880
I some research to that. Uh there's like

915
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,279
a weird alphabet that's just like

916
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,120
alternative to like writing in Latin and

917
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,279
English. So it just like went toward

918
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,559
mapping between English or Latin

919
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,159
characters to that alphabet. And as a

920
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,159
fun thing, I just wanted to learn it. So

921
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,080
I did all of that like remember the

922
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
mapping and even though like hey if you

923
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,480
show me just like a glimpse of it, yes I

924
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,880
can tell you. So it's not like a process

925
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,559
of how long will it take me to remember

926
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,799
but it was very hard to actually

927
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,760
transcribe things fast from one thing to

928
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,880
what I know it is but also as I did that

929
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,440
more I started to like I started kind of

930
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,399
like to remember how I learned English

931
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,279
as well with some of like the for

932
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,679
example at the end like that says ing I

933
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,360
started kind of internalizing that. So

934
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,919
whenever I saw like that kind of

935
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,840
structure of whatever shape these

936
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,080
characters and kind of oh yeah I know

937
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,840
that's I don't have to think

938
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,640
individually about each character. I

939
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,519
started to like chunk them more and more

940
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,360
into specific components that made like

941
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,279
transcribing things much easier. Yeah.

942
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,760
Yeah. I ing is a great example of what

943
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,360
it probably requires uh you know five

944
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,159
different line strokes or something like

945
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,519
that. Line dot one ng something like

946
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,600
that. And then eventually you bundle it

947
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,880
as an ing and just memorize those

948
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,640
characters together. And then eventually

949
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,320
you realize it's a gerand and it has a

950
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,440
particular kind of modification to verbs

951
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,799
and things like that. And you're not

952
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,559
even thinking about it now when you look

953
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,480
at the word jumping. Um but you went

954
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,320
through a process of sort of learning

955
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,080
all of those kinds of things. Okay,

956
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,919
good. Um so based on these models of

957
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,120
human cognitive architecture, what are

958
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,799
some of the key kind of instructional

959
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,799
consequences that come out of this

960
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,799
model?

961
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,039
If you overload the working memory,

962
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,720
students can't store the necessary

963
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,120
information in the long-term memory.

964
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,120
Good. Um, so what what teachers should

965
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
be thinking about in some in this model,

966
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,960
what teachers been think about all the

967
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,440
time is like how much cognitive load,

968
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,880
how much stuff is in people is like

969
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,600
being like could potentially be

970
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,000
overwhelming people's working memory. Um

971
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,720
what are some ways to conduct

972
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,799
instruction that respects this

973
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,320
bottleneck of working memory? What are

974
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,320
some what are some effective strategies

975
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,919
for dealing with that? Uh guided

976
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,159
practice is one of them that I saw where

977
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,240
it's like a completion exercise. uh

978
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,200
because then it's not completely novel

979
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,080
to you and you have

980
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,399
more you you can basically abstract more

981
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,640
ideas into schemas that are kind of

982
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,399
bigger and then execute them much faster

983
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,279
instead of just focusing on the smaller

984
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,679
aspects of that problem. Good. So, so

985
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,279
guided one version of guided practice

986
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,240
you know probably one of the most

987
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,000
well-known phenomenon in education

988
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,039
psychology is called the worked example

989
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,960
effect. Um, and the idea is if you show

990
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:40,960
people how to solve a problem for

991
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,880
noviceses, that is a more effective way

992
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,039
to learn it than have them just try to

993
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,960
solve the problem. Um, that a pretty

994
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,399
typical instructional sequence that

995
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,399
works pretty well is first you do a

996
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,039
worked example. You say, "This is how

997
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,799
you solve this kind of problem." Then

998
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,200
you would take parts of a problem and

999
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,559
have students just do those parts. That

1000
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,640
might be a kind of guided practice kind

1001
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,480
of thing like okay you know you just

1002
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,799
factored this polomial and it took you

1003
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,480
four steps um here and the first thing I

1004
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,000
did is I just showed you the those four

1005
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,200
steps. The next thing I'm going to do is

1006
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,760
I'm going to show you three of those

1007
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,679
steps and have you do one of them. Um I

1008
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,919
just showed you a canonical way to write

1009
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,359
an introduction paragraph. Um here is an

1010
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,119
introduction paragraph that's three

1011
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,679
quarters written. It doesn't really have

1012
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,200
a good hook. Um write a sentence that

1013
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,639
would fit in this paragraph. That would

1014
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,679
be a hook that engaged the reader. You

1015
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,040
don't have to do everything else that an

1016
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,800
introduction has to do. you don't have

1017
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
to introduce the topic because we've

1018
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,760
already done that, you don't have to lay

1019
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,200
out an argument, you don't have to

1020
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,839
establish your expertise, just do this

1021
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,280
one thing. Um, and then you can imagine

1022
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,879
like, all right, instead of, you know,

1023
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,480
if it's a four-step process, then you'll

1024
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,679
do two of the steps, then you'll do

1025
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,520
three of the steps, then eventually

1026
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,440
you'll do all of the steps. Um, and you

1027
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,280
might alternate which of those step, you

1028
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,879
know, do a bunch of one step, you know,

1029
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
missing problems where the one step

1030
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,760
that's missing is sort of different

1031
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
phases in there. Um, but we're going to

1032
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
sort of decrease the scaffing. The idea

1033
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,400
is um is that you can get people in

1034
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,599
their working memory just to attend to

1035
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,240
that particular thing they're trying to

1036
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,839
solve um to store that thing in the

1037
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,359
long-term memory and as they have that

1038
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,800
more in their long-term memory and

1039
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,800
access it as they start seeing the

1040
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,400
relationship between different steps um

1041
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,480
as they start you know their schema for

1042
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,880
an introduction is not like wait what

1043
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,520
it's the hook and then the thesis and

1044
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,040
then my expertise is that you bund you

1045
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,640
start like recognizing those things as

1046
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,960
an introduction and that you know sort

1047
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,680
of takes up less space within their

1048
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,359
working memory. Um

1049
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,800
uh so they call this the completion

1050
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,000
problem effects. Replace conventional

1051
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,920
problems with completion problems

1052
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,960
providing a partial solution that must

1053
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,480
be completed by the learners. Um this

1054
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,520
list came out of sweller 1998. Um all of

1055
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,079
these things get constantly tested and

1056
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,720
improved. Um so one thing that people

1057
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,240
realized um is an effect which I think

1058
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,839
is not on this list called the expert

1059
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,599
reversal effect but I think it shows up

1060
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,160
in some of the readings that you did um

1061
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,920
which is that for noviceses the worked

1062
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,760
example effect seems to generally

1063
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,920
speaking hold true for experts in a

1064
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,040
domain open-ended problem solving does

1065
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,880
seem to work better um than um just

1066
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,880
going through worked examples. So once

1067
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,720
people get good enough at a thing, um

1068
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,960
it's a good idea to let them solve

1069
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,880
open-ended problems presumably because

1070
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,320
their working memory is not overwhelmed.

1071
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,520
They're not overwhelmed by cognitive

1072
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,800
load, figuring out what they're supposed

1073
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,960
to do next. And so it's a chance for

1074
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,240
them to refine their abilities to apply

1075
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,599
things in different domains to get

1076
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,280
better at particular portions of things,

1077
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,359
stuff like that. Um now, what is a

1078
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,560
novice and what is an expert? Like that,

1079
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,920
you know, that is different in every

1080
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,200
domain and you'd have to, you know, it

1081
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,880
would have to be it'll be different in

1082
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,000
nuclear engineering than it is in poetry

1083
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,119
or whatever else it is. But like

1084
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
generally speaking, these are things

1085
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,359
that sort of seem to hold.

1086
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,359
Um, how do these cognitive load

1087
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:44,880
theorists conduct their research? How do

1088
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,359
you how do you, if you're a cognitive

1089
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,240
load theorist, how do you establish that

1090
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,520
an effect like this is

1091
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,920
true? What kind of research methods

1092
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,599
would you use?

1093
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,839
Well, you could do one where you just

1094
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,800
like directly ask the person so they

1095
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,240
like have their own just like

1096
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,200
understanding of like what they're able

1097
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,040
to handle or like you could like set up

1098
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,640
the problem so that you can just see

1099
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,599
directly from like the work that they're

1100
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,240
able to do like how well they're like

1101
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,839
cognitive load is being held. Good. So,

1102
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
one question that cognitive load

1103
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,119
theorists will be interested in is like

1104
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,480
when when do you feel overburdened by

1105
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,920
cognitive load? Um, it's kind of

1106
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
interesting that people are actually

1107
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,480
quite lousy at selfassessing their

1108
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,920
learning in all kinds of ways. Um,

1109
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,079
there's a classic study, I don't think

1110
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,920
we'll read about it, um, where, um,

1111
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,400
people assess their baseball knowledge

1112
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,640
and then take a test about baseball. Um,

1113
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
and the results are like the most

1114
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,839
perfectly spread scatter plot you've

1115
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
ever seen. There's basically like no

1116
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,640
relationship at all between your self-

1117
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,560
assessment of your knowledge and your

1118
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,760
actual knowledge of things. Um, so this

1119
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,119
is one of the this is one of the real

1120
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,280
challenges in cognitive load theory is

1121
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,119
that we're not really aware of our own

1122
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,880
cognitive load. We're not really aware

1123
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,800
when we're encountering desirable

1124
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,760
difficulty, which is like giving us a

1125
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,480
good amount of challenge um versus

1126
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,240
undesirable, you know, where our

1127
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,520
cognitive load is, you know, our working

1128
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,960
memory is overwhelmed and and we can't

1129
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,599
build things. So people have tried to do

1130
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,200
work along those lines. Um, what are

1131
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,880
some other ways of assessing whether or

1132
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
not an instructional effect is better

1133
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,839
than another instructional effect?

1134
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,040
I think

1135
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,839
Um in one of the papers it talked about

1136
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,920
like physiologically measuring the

1137
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,119
cognitive load just by like using heart

1138
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,960
rate and things like that. Skin

1139
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,839
conductance other kinds of things. Also

1140
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,680
said that this like very unreliable as

1141
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,599
like a measure of the cognitive load as

1142
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,440
well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Knowing when

1143
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,720
knowing when knowing when people are

1144
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,760
working memory is over. It's kind of

1145
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,280
funny, right? This is like the heart of

1146
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,280
the theory. Like how do we tell when

1147
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,560
your working me working memory is

1148
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,480
overwhelmed? And it's like pretty hard

1149
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,000
actually to tell. um you know we don't

1150
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,200
we don't have a great grasp of like how

1151
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,440
many you know there's some kinds of

1152
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,359
exercise we do which especially like

1153
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,720
really simple problem solving kind or

1154
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,480
puzzle kinds of things where you can

1155
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,760
like really tightly control how many

1156
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,359
elements are in working memory but if

1157
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,640
you're like actually trying to teach

1158
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,160
something someone in the real world like

1159
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,680
the Kreb cycle or something like that

1160
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,040
like you know how many things are in

1161
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,119
working memory every time is a lot

1162
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,119
harder to sort of check. So a pretty

1163
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,000
common set of methods that they'll use

1164
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,839
are experimental designs in which you

1165
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,359
have one group be a control group and

1166
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,920
then you have another group be an

1167
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,400
experimental group. Um you measure

1168
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,760
people's skill at some in both groups

1169
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,800
you measure people's skill in some kind

1170
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,960
of baseline. Um, so you say, um, you

1171
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,480
know, we're gonna we're gonna design,

1172
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,200
you know, we're going to go into a a

1173
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,960
math a school where they typically use a

1174
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,280
lot of open-ended problem solving, and

1175
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,400
we're going to instead have the teacher

1176
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,359
just do stuff using worked examples. Um,

1177
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,040
and we're going to see whether the

1178
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,720
worked example condition is better than

1179
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,680
the business as usual condition. And in

1180
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,160
fact, to make sure that there's no

1181
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,160
difference between the kids who get the

1182
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,680
regular condition, the business as usual

1183
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,800
condition, the kids who get the work

1184
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,720
example condition, we're going to

1185
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,880
randomly assign the teachers. We'll go

1186
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,560
we'll get 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 teachers

1187
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,920
sign up for the study. Half of them will

1188
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,359
do the old thing, half of them will do

1189
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,000
the new thing. We'll measure all the

1190
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,760
kids skill at baseline and then we will

1191
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,160
measure the skill um from uh the groups

1192
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,359
afterwards. Oh, you know if if this kind

1193
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,280
of model works

1194
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,200
um you know like the two groups at

1195
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,960
baseline in any group there's going to

1196
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,800
be a

1197
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,359
distrib polinomials or you know add

1198
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,880
single digits or um conjugate Spanish

1199
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,320
verbs or whatever it is but in any given

1200
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,599
classroom like you know there should be

1201
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,720
a distribution of skill right some

1202
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,839
people are having a hard time with it

1203
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,520
most people are doing fine and some

1204
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,960
people are doing really good um at

1205
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
baseline these two groups should be

1206
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,920
identical right because we randomly

1207
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,079
assign your teachers to two different

1208
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
groups and random assignment is magical

1209
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,720
um and people you know like every once

1210
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,839
in a while it doesn't work but for the

1211
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,800
most part like the two groups should be

1212
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:43,200
the same. What should happen afterwards

1213
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,760
um is that now here's something that

1214
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,599
makes learning research really hard. Um

1215
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,560
what kind of learning will like learning

1216
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,040
will happen in both conditions, right?

1217
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,440
Almost everything we do makes people

1218
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,720
learn somewhat like it there are very

1219
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
few things that we do that we're like

1220
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,680
boy that was completely ineffective.

1221
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,760
Like even if we're not using the most

1222
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,200
optimal techniques students still learn

1223
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,440
stuff. So in the control condition,

1224
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,520
let's call orange

1225
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,079
control, there's still at time two going

1226
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,440
to be improvement. T1, T2, you're going

1227
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,359
to see the sort of distribution move.

1228
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,720
What we want to see though is something

1229
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,480
like this, like, oh, we learned more in

1230
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,319
the experimental

1231
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,400
condition when we went from T1 to T2.

1232
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,160
Um, and in particular, we're interested

1233
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,200
in like the way cognitive load theorists

1234
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,000
do this, they're particularly interested

1235
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,599
in averages. like in general are kids

1236
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,280
more or less better off having do this

1237
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,200
like this has 10 teachers each of whom

1238
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,119
has 20 kids has 200 kids this has 200

1239
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,760
kids is one group o you know sort of

1240
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,119
better than the other um sometimes you

1241
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
can do some of this stuff some of this

1242
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,079
stuff happens in the field some of this

1243
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,200
stuff happens in laboratory kinds of

1244
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:51,040
experiments um one uh let's see if um uh

1245
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,680
so this is a modality effect which is

1246
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,359
kind of cool um replace a written expl

1247
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,280
explanatory text and another source of

1248
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,240
visual information such as a diagram

1249
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,920
with a spoken explanatory text and a

1250
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,000
visual source of information. It turns

1251
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,319
out again we don't to I would say we

1252
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,160
don't totally understand this um that

1253
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,400
your working memory seems to handle

1254
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,760
visual and auditory inputs differently

1255
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,440
and so you have a little bit more

1256
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,280
working memory to work with if you're

1257
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,960
hearing stuff and looking at stuff than

1258
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,720
if you're reading stuff and looking at

1259
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,720
stuff. Why? Nobody knows. Evolution, who

1260
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,319
knows? But it's kind of cool, right? Um

1261
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,839
so how might you study something like

1262
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,680
that? um you take a textbook um and you

1263
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,440
bring a bunch of students into the lab

1264
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,599
um and you have them do some kind of

1265
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,960
textbook learning exercise. You you

1266
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,200
measure them beforehand, you measure

1267
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,480
them afterwards. For some random half of

1268
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,760
the students who are walking into your

1269
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,440
lab, they probably are taking like a

1270
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,040
freshman psych class and they have to do

1271
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,720
this for, you know, extra credit or

1272
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,880
something like that. Um and you give

1273
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,480
them the like auditory enhanced version

1274
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,400
of this. And if the people in the

1275
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,800
auditory-enhanced condition in the

1276
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,160
modality effect condition do better um

1277
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,599
then you've sort of like you didn't have

1278
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,200
to go all the way into the field. You

1279
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,640
didn't have to like recruit a bunch of

1280
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,640
teachers in real classrooms and things

1281
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,319
like that. You can sort study little

1282
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,760
bits of this in the lab. But again, the

1283
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,680
thing that these folks are particularly

1284
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,160
interested in is um changes in average

1285
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,520
effects. Um we sort of like these models

1286
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,680
tend to assume that we're teaching stuff

1287
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,839
that everyone should learn. um it would

1288
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,000
be good if all the kids in my math class

1289
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,920
learn to factor polomials and we want

1290
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,520
strategies that on average have more of

1291
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,720
those kids learn more about factoring

1292
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,160
polinomials and other things. I'm sort

1293
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,119
of emphasizing this point because a

1294
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,800
bunch of stuff that you're going to read

1295
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,480
for next class doesn't necessarily make

1296
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,040
those assumptions. It's still about

1297
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,640
learning um but um thinks about doing

1298
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,440
research differently and thinks about

1299
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,440
goals differently.

1300
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,119
Um okay, here are uh oh good. We just

1301
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,520
did question number three here of things

1302
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,040
that I wanted to talk with you about.

1303
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,880
Um, number one, we emphasize what what

1304
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,079
for cognitive load theorists, what is

1305
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,240
the bottleneck that they're most

1306
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,000
concerned

1307
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,359
with? Working memory. There's a limited

1308
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,440
number of stuff that you can operate

1309
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,200
with in working memory. So, you got to

1310
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,359
think about, especially for noviceses,

1311
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,560
how do you reduce the complexity of a

1312
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,960
learning environment?

1313
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,960
Um what is

1314
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,640
um what what are what what are the what

1315
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,520
are the goals of cognitive learn load

1316
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,280
theory? What are like the end states of

1317
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,400
proficiency?

1318
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,359
Um for cognitive load the thirst, what

1319
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,359
does it mean to be good at stuff?

1320
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,520
Would it be to have built up a bank of

1321
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:32,640
schemas and be able to retrieve them at

1322
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,880
any time? and uh use them to work more

1323
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,200
quickly through a problem. It could it

1324
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,400
could be more quickly. So definitely I I

1325
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,480
think the first part I would say you're

1326
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,599
spot on about that you have memorized a

1327
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,599
bunch of stuff. The stuff that you've

1328
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,040
memorized is organized into schemas of

1329
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,160
varying degrees of complexity. There's

1330
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,599
some things that don't organize well

1331
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,160
into schemas but you know but we just

1332
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,160
memorize them anyway. Um, famous things

1333
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,880
that don't fit super well into more

1334
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,880
complex schemas are, um, a bunch of

1335
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,319
Asian languages have characters that

1336
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,839
don't like have a lot of logic across

1337
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,960
them. Like you just have to memorize

1338
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,440
these things and there are a lot of

1339
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,040
them. Um, and that like like schemas

1340
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,560
will only get you so far. Um, but an

1341
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,000
important thing about there's no

1342
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,319
relation I think about it this way.

1343
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,480
There's no relationship between sort of

1344
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,319
proficiency and the learning process

1345
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,560
like like what do cognitive load

1346
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,400
theorists think a really good surgeon is

1347
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,839
like a really good surgeon is both

1348
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,839
proficient at certain kinds of

1349
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,720
well-established techniques but also

1350
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,640
flexible intuitive like you you know a

1351
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,960
patient has cancer and you cut them open

1352
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,319
and it's some kind of you know like set

1353
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,000
of physical problems they've never seen

1354
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,680
before you know they don't want doctors

1355
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,280
who are like oh I must memorize the

1356
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,640
procedure and just do what I'm told they

1357
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,119
want doctors who are flexible they want

1358
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,359
poets and playwrs who are creative. Um

1359
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,880
they want, you know, teachers who are

1360
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,359
engaging and effective. Like their

1361
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,440
vision of proficiency is the same as

1362
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,359
almost anybody else who studies teaching

1363
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,240
and learning. Um just because they have

1364
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,520
methods that are sort of like it doesn't

1365
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,200
mean that they want people the rest of

1366
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,520
their lives trying to reduce the amount

1367
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,040
of working load, you know, load on their

1368
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,560
working memory. They want people who who

1369
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,480
can do all of the things that we think

1370
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,880
experts should be able to do. But they

1371
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,880
say the way you get expertise is not to

1372
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,319
take a surgeon and be like just get in

1373
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,319
there and start cutting people up and

1374
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,920
like see what happens. Like you want to

1375
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,560
train them through a particular series

1376
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,560
of processes that has them um you know

1377
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,760
memorize a particular series of facts.

1378
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,200
Those facts can be assembled in

1379
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,040
knowledge or techniques or other kinds

1380
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,119
of things and then flexibly deploy those

1381
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,839
things they memorized um to do good work

1382
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,720
in the world. Um, so, so don't don't

1383
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,440
confuse the way that cognitive load

1384
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,680
theorists want people to learn. Um, you

1385
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,440
know, which which can be like like

1386
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,480
pretty structured, have this devolving

1387
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,920
scaffolding. That doesn't mean that

1388
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,319
that's what expertise looks like when

1389
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,599
you get to the end of that process. We

1390
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,359
might teach people to be really good

1391
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,720
computer programmers through a set of

1392
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,160
worked examples, but doesn't mean that

1393
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,680
we want computer programmers who just

1394
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,720
like copy things that they've seen in

1395
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,880
the world. We want those computer

1396
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,960
programmers to be flexible, creative,

1397
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,480
novel, inventive, all those kinds of

1398
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,960
good things.

1399
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,359
Um, you read two other pieces that I

1400
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,960
didn't uh talk as much about, but does

1401
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,359
um we talked a little bit about sweller,

1402
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,480
the story of a research program. um that

1403
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:13,520
this research comes out of a particular

1404
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,200
historical context um which is people in

1405
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,359
math pretty fired up about problem

1406
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,800
solving and this guy John Sweller being

1407
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,160
like I think there are some real

1408
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,680
problems with open-ended problem

1409
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,839
solving. I think it doesn't do what we

1410
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,440
want it to do and there might be better

1411
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,960
approaches to try.

1412
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,400
Um what what what did you take away from

1413
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,119
the Michael Pashan article? So, Michael

1414
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,640
Bashan's a teacher in New York City. Um,

1415
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,760
just teaches math to a bunch of

1416
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,119
different grades and he's trying to make

1417
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,560
sense of all this research. What did you

1418
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,040
take away from the things he was trying

1419
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,040
to make sense of?

1420
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,640
So the title of his piece is not a

1421
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,119
theory of everything. What what did what

1422
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,760
did that allude to?

1423
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,240
I could give like a read response and

1424
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,560
say applying cognitive fluency theory to

1425
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,240
cognitive learn theory and just like you

1426
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,480
know restricting it to where it is

1427
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,119
putting the boundaries making sure we

1428
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,880
understand what it is and what it's not

1429
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
to make sure that when we're discussing

1430
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,200
it we're not stepping beyond it and

1431
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,280
starting like confusing things together

1432
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,960
and not know what we're talking about.

1433
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,480
Good. So some of it is him saying like

1434
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,559
all right like what like what exactly

1435
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,559
are these terms and how are they used

1436
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,240
how they mean over time? Um when Michael

1437
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,359
Pashan says not a theory of everything,

1438
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,640
what are some of the things that

1439
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,640
prominently it is not a theory of

1440
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,920
is it motivation? Yeah. Why why do you

1441
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,359
think so Michael Michael teaches math in

1442
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,400
in a school in New York? Why do you

1443
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,319
think motivation would be something that

1444
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,319
would be of pretty keen interest to

1445
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,640
Michael? I think that could like affect

1446
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,400
how likely people are to remember their

1447
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,839
content, right? They're like if you're

1448
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,000
really interested, really motivated that

1449
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,280
could affect. Yeah. Yeah. I think I

1450
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,839
think you have a subtext of Michael's

1451
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,680
argument which like my guy, you know,

1452
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,119
like your clogged working memory is not

1453
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,160
the problem I have. My problem is my

1454
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,480
kids don't care. Like like if you're not

1455
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,480
actually interested and engaged and want

1456
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,000
to learn these things, who cares if

1457
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,440
you're stuck, you know, like it's not a

1458
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,640
problem to be putting seven or nine

1459
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,079
things in their working memory. The

1460
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,319
problem is they will put zero things in

1461
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,960
their working memory. um you know the

1462
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,720
the the the pro the the problem is not

1463
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,280
the bottleneck that appears here. The

1464
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,480
problem is you can't get them to do

1465
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,800
this. You can't get them to attend to

1466
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,520
anything. Um I think there's part you

1467
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,640
know and and and for him as a teacher

1468
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,880
motivation is just a central pro like a

1469
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,880
central problem of what he does every

1470
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,640
day. How am I going to convince these

1471
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,359
fourth graders in front of me that it's

1472
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,720
worth learning these this math? Um, and

1473
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,760
that I think part, you know, reading

1474
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,880
between the lines, I think that's part

1475
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,920
of what feels really important to

1476
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,040
Michael. Um, and John Sweller says this

1477
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,200
theory doesn't do that. Um, this theory

1478
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,440
doesn't attend to issues of motivation.

1479
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,280
Uh, you know, now the good thing about

1480
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,800
doing that, um, and I think Michael

1481
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,559
comes to this conclusion in some

1482
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,319
respects is like, yeah, it's probably

1483
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,839
not a good idea for every theory to try

1484
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,280
to do everything. you know, it it

1485
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,640
doesn't diminish the contributions of

1486
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,559
cognitive load theory to say it doesn't

1487
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,720
attend to motivation, but it probably

1488
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,040
should draw our attention to the fact um

1489
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,119
that working memory is not like the

1490
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,319
single bottleneck that exists in all

1491
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,920
learning environments everywhere.

1492
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,000
They're all kinds of other bottlenecks

1493
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,119
that might be around. Again, some of the

1494
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,599
stuff that we're going to read about

1495
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,160
next week thinks of motivation as a very

1496
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,160
central issue um as maybe like the

1497
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,599
central issue to teaching and learning,

1498
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,000
which doesn't mean that this other

1499
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,680
theory is better. Um but that the the

1500
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,359
theories that we have are just models.

1501
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,720
They help us sort of make sense. You

1502
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,920
know, nobody actually understands how

1503
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,920
the brain works. Nobody actually

1504
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,200
understands how people learn. Um that is

1505
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,559
sort of beyond our but there's a lot

1506
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,400
that we can know about it and we can

1507
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,559
build these models which help us make

1508
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,839
good predictions. Um but they don't help

1509
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,200
us predict kind of everything. Um uh the

1510
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,960
other thing that I think Michael's

1511
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,119
article is really good for highlighting

1512
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,800
is that these theories change. Um how

1513
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,839
many of you read in the original article

1514
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,319
about this thing called gerine load?

1515
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,599
Yeah, that researchers in cognitive lo

1516
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,520
theory have basically given up on

1517
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,040
germaine load. Like it was an idea they

1518
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,319
had for a while. They were working on

1519
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,280
it. They thought it would predict some

1520
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,880
stuff. They thought it would explain

1521
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,079
some stuff and after a while like I

1522
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,520
don't think this germaine load idea is

1523
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,960
all that useful and people have more or

1524
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,720
less given up on it. So these theories

1525
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,160
are sort of constantly changing and

1526
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,800
evolving too. You know the version of

1527
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,000
cognitive load theory um that I might

1528
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,359
teach in this class 20 years from now is

1529
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,359
not going to be the exact same as I

1530
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,880
would have you know in the 1980s when

1531
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,559
John Sweller was just sort of putting

1532
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,079
these things together. some you know

1533
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,000
some parts of it have sort of stood the

1534
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,160
test of time I would say you know

1535
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
particularly this idea you know the the

1536
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,920
idea of extraneous load seems to be

1537
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,359
enormously helpful um if you put too

1538
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,119
much stuff in front of noviceses they

1539
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,800
won't attend to the right things and

1540
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,079
they won't remember the things you

1541
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,280
really want them to remember or they

1542
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,640
won't you know they won't be able to

1543
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,079
attend to what you want them to do but

1544
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,079
if you reduce some of that extraneous

1545
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,160
load and there are a bunch of like very

1546
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,240
specific strategies that we can use to

1547
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,839
reduce that extraneous load you know

1548
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,319
some of which are you know very very

1549
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,760
fine grained um if there are multiple

1550
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,839
sources of information frequently

1551
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,200
pictures and accompanying text um like

1552
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,800
don't put the picture over here and the

1553
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,720
text over here put them in the same

1554
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,200
place and people will learn better um

1555
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,800
that's great that's you know um like

1556
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,280
think think about how many people today

1557
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
in the United about 57 million kids in

1558
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,800
K12 schools tens of million people in

1559
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,640
higher education like if all their

1560
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,480
textbooks got a little bit better by

1561
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,920
adhering to this principle like everyone

1562
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,559
would learn you know a tiny tiny bit

1563
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,920
more but you know amvertised over 57

1564
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,200
million kids going to school for 13

1565
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,760
years that could be a lot of learning

1566
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,760
Um, that's pretty cool. Uh, all right.

1567
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,760
220. What are the last things that I

1568
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:52,640
want to leave you with? Um, you now

1569
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:56,800
have, um, 50% of the ideas that you will

1570
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,160
need to do assignment number one. Um, so

1571
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,359
again, assignment number one, which you

1572
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,559
should go to the syllabus and read, is

1573
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,400
you're going to pick an educational

1574
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,800
technology. You're going to explain it

1575
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:08,240
that if that educational technology is

1576
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,800
more inspired by instructionists, by

1577
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,559
people who are really fired up about um

1578
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,119
direct teaching of things, the cognitive

1579
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,920
load theorists or

1580
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,920
instructionists, you know, the worked

1581
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,280
example effect is an instructionist kind

1582
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,880
of idea. There are lots of education

1583
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,400
technologies which are instructionist in

1584
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,839
nature. You're like, how are we going to

1585
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,720
tell people how to do this thing so they

1586
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,920
do it better? Um there are other um

1587
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,839
pedagogies, educa um education

1588
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,319
technologies which are much more focused

1589
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,720
on experience, much more focused on

1590
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,559
apprenticeship um how do we get into the

1591
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,240
world and muck about and do things and

1592
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,640
that is what you will read about for

1593
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,640
Monday um which is you know sort of like

1594
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,000
like and both of these ideas are

1595
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,240
ancient. I mean I think I mentioned you

1596
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,760
before this quote from Plutarch um that

1597
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,000
uh education is not the filling of a

1598
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,359
pale but the lighting of a fire. Um, you

1599
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,440
know, the cognitive load theories are

1600
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,440
like, "No, pale filling is awesome. This

1601
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,880
is like super effective. We can measure

1602
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,079
how much stuff goes into the pale. We

1603
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,359
can measure how much stuff leaks out of

1604
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,119
the pale. We can measure like the

1605
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,200
optimal flow rate into the pale. Pale

1606
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,200
filling is cool." Um, we're now going to

1607
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,280
find the sort of contemporary versions

1608
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,720
of the flame kindlers. People are trying

1609
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,640
to really get their minds around like

1610
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,079
how do you get people to learn and kind

1611
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,280
of naturalistic apprenticeship

1612
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,440
reactions. So, you're going to have to

1613
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,160
find a technology. You have to explain

1614
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,960
whether it's more instructionist or

1615
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,559
constructionist, more inspired by

1616
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,559
cognitive load theory or situated

1617
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,800
learning. Describe how the features of

1618
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,880
that technology reflect these

1619
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,440
pedagogical values. That's like the

1620
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,599
first couple pages of the assignment. Um

1621
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,800
you have something like 1,200 words, but

1622
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,920
you can include pictures, you can

1623
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,119
annotate things, you be like, "Look,

1624
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,559
this is like a little screenshot of the

1625
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,640
thing and like here's, you know, where

1626
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,079
instructionism is written all over it."

1627
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,680
Then in the last part of the paper, you

1628
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,599
have to take this same technology and

1629
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,280
imagine that it was redesigned or

1630
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,440
designed originally by people from the

1631
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,880
opposite pedagogical perspective. So you

1632
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,720
might go and find a technology be like

1633
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,559
man this is like straight cognitive load

1634
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,800
theory. What if this same technology

1635
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,880
with the same kind of goals was designed

1636
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,960
by situated learning constructionist

1637
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,119
kind of people that is a t so you can be

1638
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,880
thinking um as you're doing all of these

1639
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,559
kinds of readings um what are some of

1640
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,720
the key principles that I could use? How

1641
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,480
would I apply these key principles to

1642
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,319
education technologies? which education

1643
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,440
technology am I most interested in? How

1644
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,119
am I going to learn about the other

1645
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,720
pedagogical philosophy so I can apply in

1646
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,480
the same way? Um that should give you

1647
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:22,160
some stuff to work with. Okay. Um 2:25

1648
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,920
we'll meet on Monday. You'll read stuff

1649
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,680
about situated learning. We'll do

1650
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,200
similar kinds of exercises to make sense

1651
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,559
of it. Um if you uh have questions, come

1652
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,760
swing by, take your books with them,

1653
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,960
write your names in them so that you

1654
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,000
don't get them confused with other

1655
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,839
people's. And uh you can expect another

1656
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,200
email from me hopefully in the next

1657
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,640
couple days. I remember almost every

1658
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,400
week. I don't promise it comes out. It's

1659
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,520
like a courtesy service, but it's like a

1660
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,280
little summary of what you need to do

1661
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,040
for next week. Okay, I'll stick around

1662
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,480
if anybody needs anything. Otherwise,

1663
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,799
um, have a wonderful weekend and I'll

1664
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,799
see you on Monday.
