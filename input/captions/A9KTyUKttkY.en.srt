1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:10,160
I was became interested in um uh

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,639
the Apollo space suit in graduate school

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,080
and um it had never really been written

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,840
about in design terms and the the story

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,760
that I became obsessed with and spent um

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,960
uh many years writing about um was

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,640
really a story of uh at multiple levels.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
At the first hand, um, at the first

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,880
level, it's this amazing story about how

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,880
this tiny division of what was then

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,920
known as the Plex Broad and Girdle

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
Company beat out a range of military

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,399
industrial contractors, more traditional

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,040
military-industrial contractors to build

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,200
um, uh, to really sew the Apollo space

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,239
suit that walked on the moon in uh,

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,640
1969. Um, and then secondly, it's a

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,800
story of this remarkable object. The

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
Apollo spac suit ended up having 21

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,039
different layers of fabric, each of them

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,320
with a different purpose. And um you

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,440
know, if uh uh what that means is it was

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
really a kind of um uh object that had

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,439
as much in common with the skin of the

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
person that it protected with all its

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,320
layers uh as it did with the larger

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,240
military-industrial um complex really of

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,080
of which it was a part. And so it's a

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,200
really interesting object at the

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,360
intersection between man-made systems uh

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,680
or technological systems and and the

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,240
system of the human body. And it really

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,920
um has as much in common with each of

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,320
them um uh uh and uh or has essential

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,520
qualities in in in common with each of

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,159
those uh systems. And so for me it was a

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,600
really interesting um not just a really

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,560
interesting object but a really

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,720
interesting object around which to work

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,079
through uh a lot of very important ideas

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,600
about resilience, redundancy um uh

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,280
designing with natural systems instead

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
of against them. All all of the ideas

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,240
that that uh uh my own design work tries

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
to work through at the scale of

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,439
buildings and at the scale of cities and

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,520
ecologies. So there's a a direct um link

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,119
for example between the ideas in spac

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
suit and the ideas that I've tried to

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,759
bring to uh urban design in the context

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
of designing for climate change. So

52
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,640
we've already talked about how what a

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,640
contributor um uh architecture and the

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
building of cities is to the production

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,160
of greenhouse gases and the causes of

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,760
the climate crisis. But it's also the

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,280
case that cities are at the um uh really

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
at the front line of the effects of the

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
climate crisis. coastal cities in

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,000
particular um uh but also cities as

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,879
they're affected by wildfires and other

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
um uh natural disasters which are um not

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,280
natural because they're really amplified

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
by man-made climate change to produce a

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,599
real threat to our cities and and and

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,080
landscapes. And so in terms of thinking

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,000
about how cities can be more resilient

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,959
to the effects of climate change um for

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,280
example flooding in San Francisco um uh

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,760
I think it's really important to think

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
not just in terms of um big singular

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
pieces of infrastructure which is how

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
we've traditionally thought about uh

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,959
protecting cities for example from

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,440
flooding um and instead thinking about

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
giving uh a city something that much

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,200
more resembles the immune system and the

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,720
human body. lots of different pockets of

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,599
defenses all of which can organize

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,159
together. Um but when one tiny part of a

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,080
natural system um of a resilient uh

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
natural system fails the whole system

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,720
adapts and compensates for it whereas

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,920
when one part of a dam fails the whole

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
dam is uh is useless. So I I bring a lot

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,920
of these ideas from thinking about the

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,519
history of evolution um uh uh the the uh

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,879
evolution of natural systems which is a

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
big part of the kind of intellectual

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
piece of the spac suit book to really

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,879
thinking in very practical terms about

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,959
how we can redesign cities to better

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,159
accommodate the effects of climate

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,840
change which are already coming and

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,760
which will only increase in the next uh

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
decades. So the project we're talking

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,280
about in in San Francisco and that we've

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,000
adapted to different settings settings

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,799
is a is a real example of that because

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,879
uh uh in the context of San Francisco,

101
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,040
we were looking at storm water drainage.

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,120
Um so of course San Francisco uh uh gets

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,640
the same amount of average rainfall as

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
other cities in the United States, but

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,680
it tends to come in kind of mega events

106
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,879
um uh uh which can cause um tremendous

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
flooding throughout the city. At the

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,040
time we were doing that project um 10 or

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
15 years ago, the city was looking at

110
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,280
expanding the storm water system to

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,960
better accommodate flooding. But what we

112
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,400
showed was if you took these 1500 um uh

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,240
sites throughout the city which which

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
were very well situated to do this work

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,759
and created in each of them a kind of

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,680
temporary storm water um uh uh holding

117
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,919
system which you can do which um you

118
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,600
know just looks like spongy green stuff

119
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
that holds the water before it and and

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,880
slowly lets it into the um uh uh sewer

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
system over time. Not only did you not

122
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
need to increase the size of the pipes

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
under underground to accommodate the

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,520
increased flooding, but you created a

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
system that um you know if one uh if one

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
microite fails, if another site fails

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
and and doesn't uh hold water as well as

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
it should, it's okay because the system

129
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
as a whole um is very resilient to

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,720
failure. Whereas if you have a single

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
pipe draining everything under the

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,199
ground, you have one blockage in that

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,199
pipe, the whole thing doesn't work.
