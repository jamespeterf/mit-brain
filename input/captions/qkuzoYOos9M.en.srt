00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,480
year seminar series having do Dr sorry

3
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm standing in front of you Dr Arch

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
Raja here with us today from Lawrence

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,960
Berkeley National

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,240
Laboratory uh Dr Raja completed her PhD

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,600
in chemical physics from Columbia

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,559
University after spending a year as a

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,840
postto and applied physics department at

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,760
Stanford University she joined the Cav

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,920
Berkeley as a heising Simon's fellow in

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,920
July 2019 she became a staff scientist

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
at the Imaging and manipulation of Nano

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
structures facility at the molecular

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,199
Foundry and in 2024 she became an

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,199
Affiliated faculty member of the Cav

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,399

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,040
pleasure to have you here with us uh

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,600
arch before I hand it over just a

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
reminder of course for you in the room

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,320
you can just ask your questions directly

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,240
we also have audience who listening

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,000
online you can uh typee your uh

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,479
questions through the Q&A option that's

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
available to you and I'm going to help

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,540
moderate so with that please help me

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,729
welcome Arch and thanks for joining

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,729
[Applause]

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,640
us thank you for for the kind

40
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,360
introduction and thank you for having me

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,280
over and uh all of you online and here

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,159
spending your afternoon with me to learn

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,000
about what we've been up to these past

44
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,800
few years so uh I'm Arch Raja from uh

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab I work in

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,480
that building that's the molecular

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
Foundry and uh we uh have all kinds of

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,560
research going on and I specifically

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
work in the Imaging and manipulation of

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,959
Nano structures facility and uh I'll be

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,480
talking to you about how we've been

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,239
controlling atomically thin layers uh to

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,319
do uh cool uh science uh a little bit

54
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,200
about The Foundry and uh this morning um

55
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,000
Professor bullich kindly gave me a

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,640
little bit of a history and also a tour

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,920
of MIT Nano and it's very much sort of

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,519
in the spirit um of MIT Nano so it's a

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,959
nanoscience um Research Center there are

60
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,200
five such centers uh run by the

61
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,680
department of energy in different

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,800
National Labs we are the ones in uh

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Berkeley and kind of the goal of these

64
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,319
centers is to democratize science if you

65
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,360
have a good idea you can come work with

66
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,840
us

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,280
um and we have um all kinds of equipment

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,920
and Theory uh resources for this and uh

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,720
something that I'd like to emphasize is

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
that we're a knowledge-based user

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,959
facility so you're not just coming to us

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
to you know push buttons on equipment

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,280
but really work with us to uh develop a

74
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,040
project and these user proposals can be

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,879
up to a year long you can just think of

76
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,519
it like a professional collaboration

77
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,159
where you know before you send a sample

78
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,599
to the other group you'll write a little

79
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,640
couple of paragraphs and say you know

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,439
this is what we want out of that

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,239
collaboration um so our uh so the we

82
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,879
have like weekly Optics lab group

83
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,080
meetings so this is an example of one

84
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080
you know there's my group but um most of

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,439
the people in that uh room are are users

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,959
who are really engaged they even if they

87
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,879
go back to their home institutions they

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,599
join us for these meetings and um you

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,360
know Innovation really uh uh happens

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,560
when everyone gets together and I think

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,239
this is really the spirit here at MIT

92
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Nano as well and um I'm happy to say

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,920
that you know these sort of weekly

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,159
meetings that started in Co have

95
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,959
persisted and we kind of cross-pollinate

96
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:11,079
uh ideas across disciplines here so um

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,920
sort of um uh talking about uh nanoscale

98
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,320
science uh let's go back to you know why

99
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,000
we're working in this scale at all um

100
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,720
the beauty of making different kinds of

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,080
molecules you can really control the

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,680
functionality you know atom by atom but

103
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,880
uh as you all know very well uh with one

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,680
of the noble laurates uh close by that

105
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,800
you can extend this idea before you hit

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
sort of the macroscopic physics or

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,440
chemistry limits there's the scale of

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,680
science where you can maybe tune the

109
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,440
physical dimensions of the material not

110
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,479
change the material but get completely

111
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,280
uh different properties much like the

112
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,680
way you think of you know particle in a

113
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,759
box you're mimicking it now at the Nano

114
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,400
scale by making Quantum dots of

115
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,320
different sizes uh but something as we

116
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,240
make these nanoscale objects smaller and

117
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,880
smaller for example today's Talk's all

118
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,840
going to be atomically thin

119
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,199
semiconductors which are essentially a

120
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,520
molecule thick the interactions with the

121
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,960
local environment become increasingly um

122
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,680
sort of important and maybe um we can

123
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,479
utilize those interactions to get

124
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
interesting properties so this is just

125
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,319
an example of a solvatochromic effect

126
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,080
for the Chemists in the audience you

127
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,160
know it's the same molecule put in

128
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,520
different solvents you're getting

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,319
different colors so kind of a contrast

130
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,680
to that you know often uh uh portrayed

131
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,240
colors of the quantum dot so how do you

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,160
think of it in the solid state version

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,039
is that if you have a layer you know a

134
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,680
periodic crystal that's just an atomic

135
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,960
sheet uh uh thick or a molecule thick

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,560
you have all your lines of force going

137
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
out of your material and the non-local

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
effect so the properties of what your

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,199
electrons exodons or other carriers and

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
other quasi particles are doing in these

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,800
materials is now going to be very

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,919
sensitive to not just the atoms in your

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,479
material but the ones around it and uh

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,880
in the past um we've shown that you can

145
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,199
in fact change the band gap of the same

146
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,479
material by changing its local

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,960
environment um this is an example where

148
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,400
we have a monol layer of a 2d

149
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,080
semiconductor and we put another

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,240
material on top and using Optics we read

151
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,319
out the band band Gap and um and this is

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
a demonstration of like um an inplane

153
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,800
hetr structure but it's the same

154
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,479
material throughout just the environment

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
has changed a consequence of this sort

156
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,319
of the is also that you're very

157
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,479
sensitive to disorder of the local

158
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,680
environment and um we also come up to

159
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,520
understand that there's a new type of

160
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,960
disorder called dialectric

161
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,400
disorder that can happen just by you

162
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,880
know all different kinds of schuts

163
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,479
around when you make your atomically

164
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,080
thin layer um and uh what we've uh shown

165
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,759
in the past is that you know different

166
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,720
kind of particles have different

167
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,960
sensitivities to it so your free

168
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,039
carriers would be more sensitive and

169
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,080
then your bound carriers would be less

170
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,479
sensitive but still some

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,440
sensitive and um one of the things that

172
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,360
we were able to show is that if you were

173
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,680
to make this environment somewhat

174
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,599
uniform you can improve a lot of

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,440
macroscopic properties um for example

176
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,360
this is an example where we showed that

177
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,039
when you have an as prepared atomically

178
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,479
thin layer and I'll talk about how we're

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,759
preparing those in a second um your uh

180
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,280
diffusivity or how fast your um

181
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,639
excitations move in your sample can be

182
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,919
like up to 30 times slower when you put

183
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,560
them in a very uniform uh environment

184
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,120
now how do you create this sort of

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,560
interesting environments um a very

186
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,440
common way to do it at the 2D limit and

187
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,280
there are lots of experts in the local

188
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,000
neighborhood here who can stack these 2D

189
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,560
um uh layers on top of each other to

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,440
create different local environments and

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,840
the cool thing is that you don't have to

192
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,240
worry about uh outof plane bonding or

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,039
epitaxy so long as you're dealing with

194
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,000
these um vanderwal Slayers which are

195
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,159
essentially just Bound in the plane and

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,800
no dangling bonds out of plane you also

197
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,680
have an additional degree of Freedom

198
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,199
which is the in plane rotation uh which

199
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,639
is demonstrated over there and we'll

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,240
talk quite a bit about it um in this

201
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,759
talk uh I also want to acknowledge uh

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,120
similarly there are lots of groups um

203
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,479
again also uh many groups at MIT who are

204
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,240
excelling at growing these structures

205
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,400
chemically as well and creating all

206
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,039
kinds of cool hetr structures um but for

207
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,120
the most part of this St

208
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,680
or almost all of the stock all the

209
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,240
structures we're going to be dealing

210
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,839
with are the ones that are prepared sort

211
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,240
of artisanally by peeling a larger

212
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
Crystal into very thin layers and then

213
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,600
assembling them using polymer stamps on

214
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
top of each other to you know get our

215
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,640
desired uh stack of

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,560
Interest now in the whole about 10 years

217
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,480
ago uh gim and Gregor wrote this um

218
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,240
perspective on how basically this is

219
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,920
like nanoscale Lego and over the past

220
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,839
decade what we also come to appreciate

221
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,839
is that there's a lot of stuff going on

222
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,240
between the Lego Lego blocks it's almost

223
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,640
like Plumbing between the Lego if you

224
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,200
want to imagine it and this

225
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,800
understanding what the orbitals are

226
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,760
doing across these layers is going to be

227
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,120
a big part of especially I would say the

228
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,079
first half of this uh talk and it's also

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,680
a really good segue into what got me

230
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,320
personally interested and a lot of

231
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,680
people like me interested in this field

232
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,800
because what happens when you peel these

233
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,760
2D semiconductors layer by layer is that

234
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,120
these interlayer orbital hybridization

235
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,000
changes and then all of a sudden you

236
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,040
have cool properties at the monol layer

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,480
limit so we have uh this is just to say

238
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,519
that we have a little perspective out

239
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,399
where we discuss uh kind of this

240
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,519
importance of hybridization effects

241
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,440
across the layers and there's a lot of

242
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,560
um opto Electronics uh or applications

243
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,480
that really depend on this phenomena as

244
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,200
well

245
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,240
so this is really going back to the

246
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,320
start so I started my PhD around the

247
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,120
time when these two papers came out that

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
worked with really old material so mos2

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,600
is the material that I'm going to talk

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,560
about here um and in the rest of the

251
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,240
talk it'll be WS2 but variety of

252
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,920
transition metal diogenites kind of

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,079
follow the same principle so it's a it's

254
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,600
a generally applicable picture here so

255
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,079
mos2 WS2 there have been like reviews on

256
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
you know the opto electronic properties

257
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,600
of these materials back in the ' 70s so

258
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,519
why did it become so interesting um say

259
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,760
around

260
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,240
2010 it's because uh people started

261
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,279
applying the technique of um mechanical

262
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
exfoliation where they take a piece of

263
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,959
Scotch tape or polymer and peel these

264
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,880
layers by layer and then they saw

265
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,200
something very interesting happen at the

266
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,920
monolayer limit so just to orient

267
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:55,360
ourselves the green uh Dots here are the

268
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,399
transition metals and the orange are the

269
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,880
Cal calogen so it's m Mo and S on either

270
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,000
side and it's stacked on top of each

271
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,440
other we're looking at it from the

272
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,560
side now the band structure

273
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,040
corresponding to that is like so here so

274
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,760
the highest occupied bands or the veence

275
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,839
band and the conduction band up here or

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,279
the lowest unoccupied uh orbitals uh

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,560
there's an offset in k space that means

278
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,519
you need a vibration to actually couple

279
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,160
this um transition uh and it's an

280
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
indirect Gap semiconductor the same

281
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,200
picture I've kind of trying to cartoon

282
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,920
it out here in uh in orbital picture so

283
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,079
as you go to the center of the brillan

284
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,680
zone you have more like outter plane

285
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,240
orbitals like P orbitals DZ s and as you

286
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,399
go to the edges you have more of the

287
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,480
transition metal D XY Etc uh that are

288
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,800
contributing to the uh edges of the bill

289
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,760
one zone so as you go layer by layer PE

290
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,320
layer by layer you have Quantum

291
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,519
confinement effects kicking in in the

292
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,920
out of plane Direction and so you're

293
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,160
going to start increasing the Gap

294
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,600
associated with all of these outer plane

295
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,560
orbitals like at the gamma point or in

296
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,480
between here

297
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,639
and at some point and with and that

298
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,959
point is the monol limit this indirect

299
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,000
Gap becomes larger than the direct gap

300
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,920
which is at the K point and so you

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,639
transition to a direct Gap

302
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,160
semiconductor now why is that

303
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,000
interesting because direct Gap

304
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,279
semiconductors are bright you don't need

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,199
this extra vibration or phone on to you

306
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,600
know enable the transition up or down

307
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,160
and this is a picture it's an optical

308
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,959
image you're looking at these this just

309
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,720
you know it's just a 20x image on a

310
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,360
microscope it's by I and that already

311
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,120
should tell you about the extraordinary

312
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
light matter coupling because you're

313
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
seeing something that's a just a

314
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,440
molecule thick here sitting on a

315
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,079
substrate with holes and then there's

316
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,399
fewu layers now if you were to excited

317
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,880
electrically or optically this is the

318
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,600
light emission that you see so the light

319
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,079
emission from the monol layers orders a

320
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,839
magnitude brighter than uh the few

321
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,440
layers and you already see the effects

322
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,720
of the local environment here so this uh

323
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,519
the parts sitting on the hole are

324
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,360
emitting brighter so this work done in

325
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,959
both Tony Hines and Fang Wong's group

326
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,880
that kind of got the the feel interested

327
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,680
in these Monier uh limit

328
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,720
semiconductors and uh an important thing

329
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,760
that you know uh that we'll use uh

330
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,279
throughout the talk the word is exons

331
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,839
and what are exons they're electron

332
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,560
whole pairs that abound to each other

333
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,920
and you can create them when you shine

334
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,440
uh the semiconductor with light or

335
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,959
excite them electrically so when you

336
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,519
knock an electron out of the conduct

337
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,440
veence band into the conduction band you

338
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,720
leave a hole behind and it kind of

339
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,120
they're attracted to each other like a

340
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,440
hydrogen atom now uh the physics of two

341
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,720
2D exiton so just like the way you solve

342
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,519
for a hydrogen atom was um kind of

343
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,560
solved analytically by Natalia rova

344
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,600
followed by leonet kelish um uh back in

345
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,600
the day and then you know afterwards

346
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,160
closer to you know our time people have

347
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,959
done like microscopic models explaining

348
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,240
the exons in actual materials here like

349
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,639
perovskites py materials and so on uh

350
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,240
why why are we interested in these exons

351
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,959
so what uh we found is that these just

352
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,079
like the hydrogen atom you have excited

353
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,920
ridberg States like 1s 2s 3s and so on

354
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,480
you can measure those in the exons and

355
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,720
what those measurements uh implied was

356
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,959
these exons are bound by almost half an

357
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,160
EV uh so half an electron volt so room

358
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,480
temperature is about 25 Mill electron

359
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,120
volt so these are very robust even you

360
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,199
know well beyond room temperature and

361
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,279
for your reference bulk semiconductors

362
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,519
are about you know tens of meev so now

363
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,040
we're going to play with these exons in

364
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,480
the next um for the rest of the talk um

365
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,839
the first part is going to be uh about

366
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,399
how we break this exiton up across a 2d

367
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,000
Junction so you have a donor and

368
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
acceptor semiconductor and we break this

369
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
exiton up and in the second part we're

370
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,639
going to talk about how we localize some

371
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,279
of these exons using this intralayer

372
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,360
twist and in the third part we really go

373
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,399
into the you know Micron or macro scale

374
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,320
uh where we talk about moving these

375
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,240
exitrons around in the plane of the a

376
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,720
semiconductor so if you have a junction

377
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,199
of uh two semiconductors on top of each

378
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,600
other so the top layer is um say wsc2

379
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,880
sitting on WS2 um again same sort of

380
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,279
band structure as the mos2 initially uh

381
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,959
uh described with some uh modifications

382
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:24,000
but for the most part they direct Gap

383
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,800
and one of them is U slightly um

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,800
staggered from the other actually quite

385
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,600
a bit staggered it's a few hundred me

386
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,319
and if you were to excite the lower Gap

387
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,519
semiconductor so that's the donor the

388
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:40,240
electron from that would rather move

389
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,759
into the acceptor uh layer now uh again

390
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,880
over the past decade a lot has been done

391
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,319
with just characterizing charge transfer

392
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,759
in these systems and it's sort of well

393
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,560
accepted that the charge transfer

394
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,959
happens incredibly fast within the

395
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,920
resolution of most stable top you know

396
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,560
optic systems um and there's a number of

397
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,240
references that I'm citing here and the

398
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,319
data and I'm showing you is from a

399
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,519
transient absorption measurement where

400
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:08,440
you're just tracking the bleach of the

401
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,839
exonic feature now the question that

402
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,519
hasn't been resolved um uh is where is

403
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,519
all that excess energy going you have

404
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,040
300 meev you're dumping somewhere in

405
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,639
that system and the other part is

406
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,079
obviously the vibrations are playing

407
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,279
some role in this what exactly are they

408
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,319
doing uh and finally why is it also so

409
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,880
robust um

410
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,920
so along with you know this

411
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,319
understanding that charge transfer

412
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,279
happens super fast there's a parallel

413
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,959
body of literature in thermal transport

414
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,880
that says these are just terrible

415
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,319
thermal conductors you cannot transfer

416
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,000
heat across these Junctions they're as

417
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,440
bad as air cuz you imagine right you're

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,839
peeling layer by layer and then you're

419
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,199
assembling there's all kinds of stuff in

420
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,279
between and it's so what thermal

421
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,680
transport you measure whether it's like

422
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,880
um x-ray defraction techniques with time

423
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,399
resolution or Ramen thermometry you

424
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,839
measure something that is very close to

425
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,160
the thermal conductance of air so you

426
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,560
have these two things you you have Ultra

427
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,400
fast charge transfer and you have poor

428
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,760
thermal transfer and uh in fact there

429
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,720
have been papers that have you know

430
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,679
exploited this poor thermal transport to

431
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,400
make highly anisotropic like thermal uh

432
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,959
conductance and so on this is an example

433
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,799
of an application from um another group

434
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,640
uh so what we decided to do was this we

435
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm I started my research group and boom

436
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,039
co happened so I became a user of a lot

437
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,799
of the facilities around me and it

438
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,559
turned out um that was the first year

439
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,480
they were willing to open up the

440
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,240
ultrafast Electron defraction Beam line

441
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,760
for an experiment and they were also

442
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,880
willing to let me put a sample that they

443
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,799
would typically have not been cuz it's

444
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,799
it was um it has not been tested out in

445
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,919
such a measurement it's a tiny sample

446
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,520
with a large beam and so on but we were

447
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,280
very fortunate they were willing to take

448
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,720
a chance on us and we uh essentially

449
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,000
said we're going to put this hetr

450
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,840
structure in your in your um time

451
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,679
resolved setup where they come in with a

452
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,440
fcond laser to excite your sample but

453
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,919
instead of your typical Optical probe

454
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,080
and say transient absorption you come in

455
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,200
with an bunch of electrons that's being

456
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,520
generated elsewhere and these are Mega

457
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,799
electron volt electrons so they're very

458
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,120
highly energetic so uh they they you can

459
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,360
see many orders of defraction um in this

460
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,120
system and what we observe is this

461
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,640
beautiful diagram here so you're seeing

462
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,000
like the defraction peaks of all the

463
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,880
different he hexagonal layers so there's

464
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,120
WS2 WS2 and HB an encapsulating and

465
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,640
you're going order by order so the order

466
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,360
is in the in the parenthesis there now

467
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
what is our observable here why are we

468
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,159
even doing this experiment is because

469
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,000
this intensity is going to tell you uh

470
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,480
what temperature your system is at so

471
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,360
you're literally going to be able to

472
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,159
track temperature of every monolayer

473
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,240
here so if you imagine what is heat your

474
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,080
atoms are jiggling around so in this

475
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
defraction peak uh as the atoms jiggle

476
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,840
around the brag Peak itself the

477
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,559
intensity goes down as things heat up

478
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,520
and the extra um intensity is actually

479
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:08,280
dumped in the uh diffuse scattering and

480
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,640
uh if the mean Square displacement is uh

481
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,880
connected to the intensity like so and

482
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,880
we can literally uh measure this in this

483
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,679
experiment so let's do the Baseline

484
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,159
experiment to just confirm that the

485
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,760
thermal transport sucks which is we put

486
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,799
aluminium on top and we uh we just

487
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,919
excite just the aluminium and watch the

488
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,720
heat flow through so this is our um

489
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,559
observation so you're measuring Del

490
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
Delta I over I as a function of hundreds

491
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,400
of

492
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,080
PS um and these are different orders of

493
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,240
defraction that I'm plotting and with

494
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,679
some Theory you can convert it to

495
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,320
temperature and uh what we're seeing is

496
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,240
a quantitative measure of temperature at

497
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,120
the uh anstrom scale with PC

498
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,039
resolution and so if you convert that

499
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,960
picture into temperature so what you see

500
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:56,240
is that your wse2 starts heating up uh

501
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,120
but the WS2 never really thermalizes

502
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,480
even out to nanocs

503
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,360
and if you were to fit this with a Fier

504
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,480
heat diffusion model you can extract an

505
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,080
interfacial conductance which is as low

506
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,039
as what others have measured using other

507
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,320
techniques so no surprises here now

508
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,919
let's track the energy transport after

509
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,240
photo exitation so we come in with the

510
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,200
laser we excite only the wsc2 cuz that's

511
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,360
lower

512
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,679
Gap and now we watch what happens notice

513
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,240
the x-axis is now just few picoc seconds

514
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,760
no longer hundreds of picoc seconds kind

515
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,280
of within a couple of PCS the wsc2 and

516
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,240
the WS2

517
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,880
thermalize and uh you if you were this

518
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,640
highly non-e equilibrium situation but

519
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,200
you can parameterize this just to get a

520
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,000
handle on if it were if you could use

521
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,360
the word capit conductance here or

522
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,559
interfacial conductance here it would be

523
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,559
ridiculously high it would be like three

524
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,240
orders of magnitude higher as much as

525
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,679
you know say some metallic interfaces

526
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,760
and then watch how it cools it also

527
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,440
concurrently cools over the nanoscale um

528
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,159
um time you know resolution that we have

529
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
so it's very clear from the previous

530
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,880
slide that you know the previous

531
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,320
mechanism cannot explain this data so it

532
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
cannot be just

533
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,440
phons uh just to put it in perspective

534
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,919
if you only had phons it's as bad as I

535
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,679
know Diamond uh interfaces and then if

536
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,080
you were to um parameterize the

537
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,559
conductance out with the free I mean

538
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,440
sort of the photo exited carriers you

539
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,400
have super high interfacial

540
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,840
conduction so the picture boils down to

541
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,840
the fact that you actually do have have

542
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,159
this interlayer uh hybridization which

543
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:40,799
now enables you to have a sort of a

544
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,520
phonon um electron um coupled mechanism

545
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,279
where from your K point which is the

546
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,600
point where I'm exciting it it will go

547
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,320
into this elevator state or a portal

548
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,360
that will take you to the next level

549
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,640
with very sort of very easily because it

550
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,919
doesn't matter at what angle you are or

551
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,480
what um uh this uh you know p orbital DZ

552
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,600
Square orbital hybridization that I

553
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
talked to you about at the beginning of

554
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,919
the talk that's fairly robust and even

555
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,960
if you're assembling it by hand that

556
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,840
hybridization is what is going to help

557
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,559
you with now moving the electrons from

558
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,080
one layer to the

559
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,559
other and um our Theory collaborators

560
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,320
calculated this in sort of a firy golden

561
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,000
um rule kind of uh picture where they

562
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,720
start with one state to the other and

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,360
they can uh make these plots where they

564
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,679
tell you if you were to start at the K

565
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,720
point Point here which is the star here

566
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,000
uh after 30 Picos seconds where do you

567
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,279
end up and this is just um you know

568
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,799
spots of uh the brighter the spot the

569
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,440
higher probability it'll end up there

570
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,799
and this is basically the region around

571
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,440
the Lambda Valley and they can do the

572
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,799
same um you know for the other layer as

573
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,480
well and just this 30 ftoc time scale it

574
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,240
kind of checks out with measurements

575
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,400
that have been done with like line um

576
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,400
just from Linewood broadening or time

577
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,919
resoled

578
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,279
arpis uh and so let's look at this uh

579
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
picture now in theory you can do a lot

580
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,200
of cool things you can also split it up

581
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,760
into acoustic phonons Optical phonons uh

582
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,559
layer by layer so and they've done it

583
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,039
now in the other layer where you start

584
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,320
from the Lambda Valley and where do you

585
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,320
end up you actually do end up mostly at

586
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,720
the K valy it would appear so in the end

587
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,559
you know the to explain the sort of

588
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,760
bidirectional um um phonon uh transport

589
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,000
or heating after photo exitation you

590
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,120
need to invoke this state that's

591
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,120
hybridized across these layers which is

592
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:40,320
insensitive to twist or to um the fact

593
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,159
that you just assembled it um and uh our

594
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,320
observation is consistent with also the

595
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,559
uh charge transfer time scales of 100 uh

596
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,640
fto

597
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:53,480
seconds now just to summarize um we've

598
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,559
been able to now investigate what's

599
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,080
happening during this Ultra fast uh

600
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,200
charge transfer process to that 300 M of

601
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,919
energy that you're kind of Distributing

602
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,960
in your sample while you do this Ultra

603
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:09,240
fast charge transfer and the mechanism

604
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,279
identifies uh the role of uh this

605
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,480
interval hybridized or inter layer sorry

606
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:16,679
hybridized states that enables this uh

607
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,360
transfer and it's a very distinct

608
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,120
mechanism because if you were to look at

609
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,039
just dialectric dialectric metal metal

610
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,240
metal dialectric or metal semiconductor

611
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,919
You' invoke some version of the phonon

612
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,200
going through or the electron tunneling

613
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,279
through you know electron dissipating

614
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,159
phonons and they uh they go through

615
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,880
instead whereas here it's truly a

616
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,240
coupled electron phonon mechanism that's

617
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,240
enabling this um charge transfer there

618
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,720
are lots of things that have not you

619
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,200
know been solved in in this um

620
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,840
experiment um we could in principle if

621
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
you had better samples identify the

622
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,200
diffuse scattering and actually watch

623
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,760
those parts of the brillan Zone light up

624
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,399
where the phone on are uh going uh this

625
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,600
has been done in like bulk samples uh

626
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,760
but not in these atomically thin uh

627
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,679
layers um and then there might be ways

628
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,399
to tune this Lambda Valley and tune the

629
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,200
thermal transport so I can imagine that

630
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,799
being pretty useful to you know devices

631
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,559
uh where you can control how much your

632
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,440
um uh uh thermal transport is is and

633
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,480
also where it's happening using maybe

634
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,679
strain and other things there are few

635
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,640
different knobs here that um we could

636
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,840
have been tuning uh as well so uh before

637
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,159
I go to the next part I want to

638
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,360
acknowledge you know everyone who was

639
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,200
involved cuz this was a pretty big team

640
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,360
effort to get this done especially in

641
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:38,360
the pandemic um so our beamline folks um

642
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,039
uh our group um collaborators uh and and

643
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,320
and the the especially the theory

644
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,880
collaborators so so far everything that

645
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,960
I talked about was you know we have this

646
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,799
WS2 on top of wsc2 and we don't care

647
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,840
about the twist we're just looking at

648
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,520
how we can break apart the exaton that

649
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,279
you create in one of the

650
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,360
layers um now for a second if you were

651
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,919
to align them

652
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,520
uh you realize it has about 4% ltis

653
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,600
mismatch and it would take like 26 unit

654
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,480
cells of WS2 to match 25 and you get you

655
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,720
can create a super cell um which will

656
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,840
now repeat over and over again and at

657
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,399
different angles such super stells still

658
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,320
exist but they're much

659
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,200
smaller uh why are we uh now interested

660
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,960
in going at 0 degrees if you ask is

661
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,559
there at around again um 2019 2020 there

662
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,399
were lots of papers that said we're

663
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:33,640
seeing signature es of uh new

664
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:37,159
excitations due to this um kind of uh

665
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,760
alignment of the uh Mor pattern the mor

666
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,320
patterns basically the super lce that

667
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,440
you're creating by uh stacking these two

668
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:48,120
layers so a number of um papers that

669
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,399
look at uh photoluminescence uh em uh so

670
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,399
you're just looking at the emission and

671
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:54,480
you see new Peaks and say you attributed

672
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:57,200
to this um and there was also a paper uh

673
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,760
with time resolved arpus which suggested

674
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,399
maybe these are localized so they see

675
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,000
like a kpace

676
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,720
localization um but of course it would

677
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,480
have been very nice to see it in real

678
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,440
space and uh that's what we started

679
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,559
hunting for uh and this and the system

680
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,440
we chose was one uh the same one that we

681
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,279
had a lot of experience with uh and if

682
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,200
you were to look at the absorption so

683
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,760
the reflectance contrast um at this

684
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,279
ultra thin limit for all practical

685
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,880
purposes you can think of it like UVA

686
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,840
absorption so what you're seeing here

687
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,360
are peaks of the WSC 2 peaks of the WS2

688
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,880
the two different semiconductor layers

689
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,399
and this is what it looks like at a

690
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,480
large twist Angle now if you align these

691
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:43,120
layers what uh Fang Wang's group on

692
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,320
campus in in UC Berkeley found is that

693
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,880
you're um if you look at the lowest uh

694
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,799
Exon Peak it actually splits into Three

695
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,799
Peaks um and we picked this system

696
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:57,840
because if we really want to do a hypers

697
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,600
spectral map within one Mor unit cell um

698
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,640
there techniques that are immediately

699
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,360
available like electron energy loss

700
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,039
spectroscopy and uh absorption which is

701
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,760
basically like measuring a dialectric

702
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,240
function and that's what eels has been

703
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,600
used to do you know for many years so if

704
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,840
you look at uh our experiment again it's

705
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,480
just like um light spectroscopy except

706
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,039
that now we're using the uh inelastic

707
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,120
scattering of electrons and sending that

708
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:31,559
to um uh spectrometer so we stuck our um

709
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,480
hetra structure in uh the Team One

710
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,480
microscope at the national Center of

711
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,120
electron microscopy so NM is part of the

712
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,880
molecular Foundry so it's the seventh

713
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,279
floor of our Foundry we like to say it's

714
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:47,279
just in the next building and uh so we

715
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,720
come in and you get two things one is

716
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,880
just as your electron scatter off your

717
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,440
um nuclei you get structural information

718
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:57,880
which is in over here in that uh anulus

719
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,799
and then the energy that's uh sort of

720
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,159
the inelastically scattered electrons we

721
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:06,960
collect them and send it in into a

722
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,799
spectrometer um so the dialectric

723
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,279
function um is what we are ultimately

724
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,240
after because that's what the absorption

725
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,799
Spectrum gives us right and the

726
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,399
scattering of an electron off your

727
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,159
material you can split it up into

728
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,440
different parts you know there stuff

729
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,519
related to the normalization You Know

730
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,960
sample related there's the angle at

731
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,640
which you're collecting but a big chunk

732
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,360
of it is related to the IM AR part of

733
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,720
the dialectric function which is related

734
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,480
to absorption directly to that

735
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,840
reflectance contrast that was I showed

736
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,440
you in the previous slide now in

737
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,320
principle if all goes well we can try to

738
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,559
do a hyperspectral map but now with a05

739
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,360
nanometer prob so that's what we are

740
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,399
after so there are a number of

741
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,559
experimental challenges um so in in the

742
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:53,440
temm at least back then you don't have a

743
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:55,640
cryostat to do this measurement we do

744
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,600
need to go to cold temperatures because

745
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,679
your exiton lines get sharper you can do

746
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,240
cleaner

747
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,640
experiments uh and that just makes life

748
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,600
easier and also damage to your sample um

749
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,240
as many people who do cryo know is

750
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,559
reduced uh a lot as well we're talking

751
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,279
about super thin materials here these

752
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,760
electrons can the high energy electrons

753
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:15,799
literally knock atoms off these if

754
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,200
you're not careful so we don't have

755
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:20,720
cryostats but you have a bucket of

756
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,760
nitrogen and um you know you can measure

757
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,440
within the time it evaporates so it's a

758
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,679
bit of a hero experiment um though I

759
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,880
have to state that now we are installing

760
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,640
an actual cryostat and I'll probably be

761
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,640
able to tell you in a year how it all

762
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,679
goes um another important sort of

763
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,399
technological advance that enabled this

764
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,039
measurement was around the time I joined

765
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:43,159
The Foundry they also got this direct

766
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,720
electron detector so they able to

767
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:48,559
measure every electron you know with

768
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,480
high Precision very little uh

769
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,440
noise um and finally the monochromation

770
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,039
so you photons it's easy to monochromate

771
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,440
electrons a lot harder uh and we got

772
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,480
about you know 1

773
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,960
me so it's pretty broad it's very Broad

774
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,320
and you'll still see that you don't

775
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,279
always need the perfect set of

776
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,919
experimental conditions to if you choose

777
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,399
your phenomena correctly so that's kind

778
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,840
of the lesson from this experiment and

779
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,159
I'd be very remiss if I didn't

780
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,880
acknowledge sandya and Peter sandya Sara

781
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:23,760
was a postar now faculty in um ASU in

782
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,960
Arizona State and Peter Aria's uh staff

783
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,080
scientist at NM uh they were really

784
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,320
willing to collaborate with us on our

785
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,159
not so clean samples and really iterate

786
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,120
with us what we get beam time or you

787
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,240
know electron time once a month and we

788
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,840
kind of iterate it over you know a year

789
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,279
in Co to get to where we are and my

790
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,399
group Daria and uh was a visiting

791
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,880
student on this scgsr program uh many of

792
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,279
you if you're interested in this just

793
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,159
let me know I can tell you more about it

794
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,360
she spent um a few months in my group

795
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,000
and my postto yonas so they would make

796
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,240
the samples on an aperture on just a

797
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,919
silicon aperture and so that the

798
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,519
electron micr scopists don't have any

799
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,840
confusion where to land so there's only

800
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,679
one hole that's the only place the

801
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,679
electrons are going to go through and um

802
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,960
so the and a really important part that

803
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,919
um many times is missed is how important

804
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,960
sample preparation is for such an

805
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,799
experiment so like for example we

806
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,600
designed this aperture so that it's easy

807
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,519
to find the sample even in an optical

808
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,519
microscope folks know how hard it is

809
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,639
sometimes to find the layers you want so

810
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,240
imagine now at the Nano scale um and a

811
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:29,480
very important characterization we have

812
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,679
to do before we stick it in is called

813
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,159
second harmonic generation and that it's

814
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,159
like doing x-ray crystallography but

815
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,240
just on your Micron scale in your sample

816
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,399
these monol layers are conveniently they

817
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,360
lack cental symmetry so you get these

818
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,039
nice polar plots uh these kind of flower

819
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,840
plots and that tell you about exactly

820
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,639
how you've aligned your two layers um

821
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,440
you as you're aligning them on the

822
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:55,000
polymer stamp you know you the student

823
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,120
or post dog makes a guess okay this

824
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,200
looks roughly zero we put it in but it

825
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,799
could be UH 60 um and sag or second

826
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,880
harmonic generation is a coherent

827
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,519
process so if it were zero or 60 you'd

828
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,480
get you know if it can constructively or

829
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,039
destructively interfere and this is

830
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,360
something we determine a PR and this

831
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,760
actually fairly hard to do in the

832
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,440
electron microscope if you haven't done

833
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,840
it um you know

834
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,799
earlier so this is the you know the the

835
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,360
hero experiment so we um have all of the

836
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,639
um Spectra stacked here so in Gray is

837
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,720
Optical Spectra taken in our Optical cry

838
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,000
super sharp you can monochromate your

839
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,519
photons really well right and overlaid

840
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,440
in color are all the Spectra we get in

841
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:43,159
the eels um uh Spectrum so it's broad

842
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,159
because your monochromation is only 130

843
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,760
meev but it's satisfying to see that if

844
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,200
you were to broaden the the very sharp

845
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,559
Peaks we have it roughly matches uh the

846
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,559
eels uh

847
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,559
Peak uh now a little interlude on

848
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,159
structure before we get back to those

849
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,799
eel speaks so this is where our Theory

850
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,480
collaborators come in and what they said

851
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,480
is actually okay everyone talks of these

852
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,839
things as Lego blocks you just stack

853
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,879
them on top of each other but you know

854
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:14,159
what if you were stacked AA which is if

855
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,320
your calans were just sitting on top of

856
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,560
each other over here where my um laser

857
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,040
pointer is if say your sulfur and your

858
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,399
selenium are on top of each other it's

859
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,919
eclipsed right and thermodynamically

860
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,280
that's un less favorable than if it were

861
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,760
staggered in these B stacking situations

862
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,399
where it's just energetically not

863
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,720
hitting up against another atom or the

864
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,440
static hindrance is not there so if you

865
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,800
were to just relax this structure it's

866
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,960
no longer just a simple Lego but it's

867
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,119
reconstructing and uh you can see that

868
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,520
you know just if you did the structure

869
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,879
you should be able to see a difference

870
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,320
is what they said and so we went in and

871
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,480
you can also simulate you know what your

872
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,200
um structure should look like with and

873
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,240
without uh the relaxation so if there

874
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,200
was no relaxation so let's just focus on

875
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,000
D here okay before we get to the other

876
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,119
ones say there was no relaxation

877
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,839
everything was super rigid what are you

878
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,119
seeing in the in the structural image

879
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:13,200
what you're seeing is uh the interaction

880
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,560
of the electron with the nuclei and if

881
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,240
you have a column of nuclei and and if

882
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,160
you're if you more nuclei in one column

883
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,960
in this method um in ADF you get a

884
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,200
brighter signal so that's what you see

885
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,200
so the a a regions you anticipate it to

886
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,880
be brighter and the B regions to be a

887
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,359
bit duller because the net kind of

888
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,280
nuclear Mass through that is lower and

889
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:36,599
you should but then the size of that

890
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,720
spot should roughly be the same if you

891
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,760
were to um look at our experimental data

892
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,000
out at F what you see is that's not what

893
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,200
you see you see that the super bright

894
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,960
spots are significantly smaller than the

895
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,960
the less bright spots and qualitatively

896
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,920
it matches with this kind of relaxation

897
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,240
picture that we have so again uh going

898
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,160
beyond the Lego picture here so now

899
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,839
let's get back to uh what our um main

900
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,440
goal was which was to try and do this

901
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,240
hyperspectral Imaging of this Mor exiton

902
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,200
cuz there's a suggestion that you could

903
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,040
localize them like you know basically

904
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,760
create little quantum dot like States in

905
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,720
them um so I'm stitching together four

906
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,480
unit cells so you have this bright spot

907
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,880
here which is the AA spot and then you

908
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,400
have the b s sites here that are uh and

909
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,680
then you go back to a so let's um look

910
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,960
at the Spectra uh from the eel

911
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,200
spectrometer um at these three different

912
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,880
spots so this is what you see so at the

913
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,160
a aite you measure a lot more oscillator

914
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,720
strength than what you measure at the B

915
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,560
sites so it doesn't matter that our

916
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,599
monochromation was not that great I

917
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,599
think this was enough to make the

918
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,920
suggestion that you have localized

919
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,160
oscillator strength at the at one of

920
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,240
these sites so if you almost think about

921
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,040
it it reminded me um a lot about say

922
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,960
traditional Quantum Wells where you

923
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,960
might have like face segregation or you

924
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,760
know um alloy segregation which leads to

925
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,400
like localized emission so if you think

926
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,480
about what's happening here is that you

927
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,839
have a super ltis of exaton in an ideal

928
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,839
sample so we're presenting average data

929
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,280
in an ideal sample you have a super lus

930
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,240
of exonic States if you were to fix the

931
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,280
hole at the a site and plot the electron

932
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,160
cloud what our Theory collaborators

933
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,000
would show is a picture like this

934
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,160
where the electron density just like

935
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,760
drops off rapidly as you go to the other

936
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,920
sides so they can you know create a

937
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,599
picture in theory of what such a super

938
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,720
lce looks like um and we can create our

939
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,280
picture with from experiment kind of

940
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,200
smear it the same amount and um

941
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,480
basically what you're what we're showing

942
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:53,079
is that um if you're you're localizing

943
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:57,000
your exitation at these AA sites where

944
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:59,880
uh you have your cogens lined up and uh

945
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,640
the o later strength um you know is is

946
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,800
localized there and in principle if you

947
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,839
had a perfect sample you could have like

948
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,960
a u super lus of these exonic states

949
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:11,520
which are cool for a variety of

950
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,079
applications so one thing that's in

951
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,640
progress is of course we wanted to see

952
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,119
all the three Mor exiton Peaks and also

953
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,920
try to understand you know more about

954
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,520
the heterogeneity in the system so we've

955
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,440
been doing different types of ramen and

956
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,839
also um spectroscopy in a temm out at

957
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,280
oakd where they have like 10 meev

958
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,319
resolution and we've also had samples

959
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,720
where some samples are non-reconstructed

960
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,079
some samples are

961
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,560
reconstructed and U we really this is

962
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,480
sort of unpublished you know data that's

963
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,960
um where we're trying to understand uh

964
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,200
you know really the heterogeneity in

965
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,400
this system and we're seeing some

966
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,079
differences between the reconstructed

967
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,119
and non-reconstructed samples and their

968
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,560
Optical

969
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,359
signatures uh so let me um acknowledge

970
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,599
uh everyone here uh to whom uh you know

971
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:04,560
um who made this happen before I go to

972
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,800
my very final part which is again same

973
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,040
material systems WS2 wsc2 I'm not

974
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,800
changing anything so hopefully uh you're

975
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:17,240
uh up for a little bit more uh uh

976
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,319
science uh just the last lap here so we

977
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,760
have this Mor um system right where you

978
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:25,280
have the um luses on top of each other

979
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,280
the WS2 and

980
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,920
wsc2 uh of course you like in the first

981
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,760
part I told you there's charge transfer

982
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,240
also happening in the system and that

983
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,520
happens but when you have the ltis is

984
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,680
aligned the electron in the hole

985
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,440
actually stay Bound for much longer and

986
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,359
now you can try to do little tricks with

987
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,800
this um this is no longer an archive

988
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,040
sorry this is um just published this uh

989
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,000
middle of this year um and you know it's

990
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,440
the same principle right you have the um

991
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,640
electron jumping to the other layer but

992
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,240
when you have them aligned they can

993
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,680
stick together for longer and then they

994
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,400
can also emit as an interlayer exiton so

995
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,079
this is just to show you what a typical

996
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,640
sample looks like um you have the two

997
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,480
layers sitting on top of each other

998
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,200
encapsulated in um boron nitride which

999
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,040
passivates and protects it and in this

1000
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,000
overlapping region all your monolayer

1001
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,839
emission is quenched but you have a

1002
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,640
completely new Peak that appears at a

1003
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,440
different wavelength that's related to

1004
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,760
this inter layer um exiton and uh we

1005
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,040
studied what happened happens to this

1006
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,760
interlayer exiton in this Mo potential

1007
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,200
that we showed you before um and I'll

1008
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,640
just quickly go over some of the results

1009
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,480
um uh the experimental setup is uh

1010
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,800
something that you know um like

1011
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,440
Professor Tales group is an expert in

1012
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,119
very familiar with uh or uh uh Professor

1013
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,880
SCH schoen's group uh you know we just

1014
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,200
have regular Optical setup defraction

1015
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,079
limited spot and we come in with visible

1016
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,599
exitation we collect the pl and then we

1017
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:04,920
walk watching what happens to the pl as

1018
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,480
um we ex U um we excited and so the spot

1019
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,200
spreads and that's a handle on the

1020
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,680
diffusion or the transport of your

1021
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,720
exitation and then we collect it on like

1022
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,960
an image we monochromate to a

1023
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,240
spectrometer we also measure uh Lifetime

1024
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,640
and move move around uh the sample okay

1025
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,319
so this is what the experiment is just

1026
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,960
to reorient

1027
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,720
you and um you know we did a temperature

1028
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,440
depend in measurement because we thought

1029
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,319
now you have this you know Mor potential

1030
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,280
this egg boox like potential that you're

1031
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,920
living in um it should be like a AR

1032
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,119
renous process you have an activated

1033
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,880
process for diffusion and then you

1034
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:44,839
suppress diffusion uh once you're below

1035
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,160
some temperature but uh you know uh

1036
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,520
there are few different things that we

1037
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,480
saw so first we measure just the

1038
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,000
diffusion length from these images on

1039
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,640
the camera and then we measure the

1040
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,119
lifetime which just drops uh

1041
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,319
continuously doesn't matter whether it's

1042
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,839
0° 60° inrease um and then if you were

1043
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,560
to plot the

1044
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,200
diffusivity uh what you see as you um

1045
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,920
you know for the most part above 100

1046
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,160
Kelvin it behaves like an activated

1047
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,560
process um but then below 100 Kelvin

1048
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,680
things kind of start to Plateau out to

1049
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,720
like a non you know not so small number

1050
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,440
so it's diffusing still really well even

1051
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,880
down to cryogenic

1052
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,280
temperatures um and we couldn't explain

1053
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,280
why this was happening you know you're

1054
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,559
still in the mor potential why shouldn't

1055
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,079
it just like stop moving U but have a

1056
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:36,319
Remnant

1057
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:39,119
diffusivity um and for that we uh worked

1058
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,440
with um johanes lishner group at

1059
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,079
Imperial where they you know created

1060
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,040
this Mor hopping potential for us you

1061
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,680
know fitted fitted it closely with our

1062
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,520
experimentally extracted values just

1063
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,960
from the arenus part

1064
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:59,160
um and uh to cut a long story short what

1065
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,440
they say is now the more a um material

1066
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,040
has very interesting mechanical

1067
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,400
properties it can host new kinds of

1068
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,720
phonons just because you're kind of tra

1069
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,480
locked locking two materials together

1070
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,440
which have a 4% lattice mismatch your

1071
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,200
lattice is constantly moving even at low

1072
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,240
temperatures because you have these

1073
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,680
ultra low Shear modes that come about in

1074
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,040
these materials that wouldn't have

1075
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,040
existed if you didn't have this Mor and

1076
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,119
if you were to do a kind of an MD

1077
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,520
snapshot molecular Dynamics so

1078
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,000
simulation where you take a snapshot of

1079
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,960
the veilance band and the conduction

1080
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,920
band over

1081
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,520
time they literally show that moving and

1082
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,319
so they say the mechanism for this

1083
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,640
diffusion possibly is this so we have we

1084
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:43,680
don't have it's not um we don't have the

1085
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,599
what do you call the we haven't caught

1086
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,160
it red red-handed so to speak but this

1087
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,440
is a proposal of what could be happening

1088
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,680
because these are the you know new modes

1089
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,760
that exist down to uh low cryogenic

1090
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,319
temperatures and typically diffusion um

1091
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,800
needs like phonons to assist in its

1092
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,119
motion except in this case they're

1093
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,440
assisting in a different way not

1094
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,280
directly scattering of the exiton but

1095
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,640
literally the the lce is

1096
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:16,200
dynamic um so just to uh summarize so we

1097
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,480
you know looked at this WS2 wsc2

1098
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,839
heterojunction uh two semiconductors on

1099
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,839
top of each other really looked at from

1100
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,680
the atom scale and then all the way out

1101
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:27,720
to like the diffusion of energy or exons

1102
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,040
in this case uh which Carri the energy

1103
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,720
in the 2D

1104
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,839
landscape um and let me uh acknowledge

1105
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,400
everyone who was involved in this work

1106
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:40,880
as well um and finally yeah so I think

1107
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,280
we we did all of it in good time with

1108
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,160
time to spare for questions so um thank

1109
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,960
you so much for your attention and of

1110
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,760
course if you want to talk to me about

1111
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,359
uh working with us either as a user or

1112
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,280
joining the group just reach out to me

1113
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,520
come talk with me at the reception email

1114
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,319
me but I'll leave this out here for

1115
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,800
questions thank you so much much for

1116
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:02,119
your attention thank

1117
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,880
[Applause]

1118
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,280
you we have some time for questions any

1119
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,960
questions in the audience and for

1120
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,319
whoever is listening online please feel

1121
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,079
free to uh type her questions and Kelly

1122
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,559
can you help me moderate if there's a

1123
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,640
question any questions from the

1124
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:22,040
audience okay I'll start with one can

1125
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,359
you comment more I guess I have two

1126
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,280
questions I'll start with one more on

1127
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:29,160
the implications of this sheer mode

1128
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,240
phonons that you talked about maybe just

1129
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,520
describe it in a little bit more depth

1130
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:36,880
and uh what exactly it implies and you

1131
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,280
mentioned also you haven't

1132
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,800
experimentally yet been able to identify

1133
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,000
is there a path towards that right so

1134
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,760
the um ultra low frequency modes they

1135
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,720
anticipate it to happen you know like at

1136
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,000
an me or

1137
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,559
less uh and it's basically that you have

1138
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,920
um they call it a phas on it's just

1139
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,200
another uh it's like words they take

1140
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,000
from the Quasi Crystal literature but

1141
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,400
basically because you have this Mor

1142
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,119
pattern on top you can um describe the

1143
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,720
interlayer motion and and that leads to

1144
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,800
a new phonon kind of mode which is

1145
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,839
related to this interlayer here now the

1146
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,680
ways to identify it I think from the

1147
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:20,200
selection rules what I understand the

1148
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,839
ideal kind of measurement might have

1149
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,240
been like brillan scattering but to do

1150
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:27,040
brillan scattering on small samples is

1151
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,880
quite challenging

1152
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,720
um an other way to maybe look for it

1153
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,440
would have been probably maybe the ultra

1154
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,000
fast electron defraction maybe we would

1155
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,440
see signatures of it there so I think

1156
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,800
it's just at this window where we see

1157
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,440
low fre so we've done a lot of low

1158
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,200
frequency Ramen on this but our

1159
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,640
holographic filters and all of those

1160
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,359
things go down to only about 10 wave

1161
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,559
numbers and that's not anywhere close to

1162
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,880
where these modes are so that's one of

1163
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,440
the reasons we've not been able to

1164
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,240
measure them the reason we invoke that

1165
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,760
explanation is because we don't have any

1166
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,880
other good reason why there's even

1167
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:06,240
diffusion um down to you know even below

1168
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,240
30 Kelvin yeah great thank

1169
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,680
you jumping on that um I I I also found

1170
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,960
the persistent diffusivity at low

1171
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,319
temperature to be really interesting and

1172
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,040
the low frequency Shear modes are are

1173
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,839
are an interesting hypothesis could you

1174
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,000
could you not also have a resonant

1175
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,400
dipole mediated aiton transfer process

1176
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,640
where the electron in the hole aren't

1177
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,160
physically moving but they could be you

1178
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,160
know if if you imagine these localized

1179
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,599
Moray States as Quantum dots you know

1180
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,040
you could have recombination at one site

1181
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,359
and then that uh that field excite

1182
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,680
another electron hole pair and that

1183
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,119
would manifest as a parent ex transport

1184
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,319
um so I think uh the recombination so

1185
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:49,880
let me think about this so you're saying

1186
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:52,079
that the interlay Exton would recombine

1187
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,920
and then or or virtual You' create like

1188
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,000
a virtual Photon which which would then

1189
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,720
be created as another type of as you're

1190
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,920
as you're saying that I'm I'm realizing

1191
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,680
the oscillator strength would be an

1192
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,000
issue yeah yeah so the oscillator

1193
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,839
strength is like I think it's even been

1194
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,359
measured um in Ton's group recently um

1195
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,559
maybe even five orders of magnitude

1196
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:12,119
lower so I think that's that's where the

1197
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:14,240
yeah cuz the vertical dipole you're all

1198
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,680
um you're not only separated vertically

1199
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,240
you know this uh by space but also like

1200
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,839
laterally a little bit so yeah you just

1201
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,880
have very low oscillator strength compar

1202
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:24,720
to the a exiton so in principle you

1203
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,920
could say you can absorb you know in

1204
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,280
plane but then the dipoles are

1205
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,640
completely orthogonal

1206
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,440
so the one with the high oscillator

1207
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,839
strength is just an orthogonal yeah so I

1208
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,400
think that's that's that absolutely

1209
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,359
rules that out

1210
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,200
yeah but there might be some other so I

1211
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,960
have to say there's been a there's a lot

1212
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,559
more activity on the theory side going

1213
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,240
on you know um probably when folks like

1214
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,319
your collaborators like Mage and others

1215
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,200
are also thinking about this because the

1216
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:51,240
way I've been describing things so far

1217
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,040
by the way I mean it it's um it's kind

1218
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,880
of like a first order thing if you think

1219
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,640
about charge transfer from one layer to

1220
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,280
the other the ideal way to discuss it

1221
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,440
would be that you start with an exiton

1222
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,760
and you end with an exiton not about

1223
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,920
like it's breaking up and going and I

1224
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,440
think that formalism as it develops I

1225
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,359
think will give us more insight think of

1226
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,760
it in the firmy Golden Rule not as an

1227
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:13,640
electron hopping from one state to

1228
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,240
another but think of you start with an

1229
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,920
intra layer exiton as your initial State

1230
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,799
and an inter layer exiton as your final

1231
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,799
state so I think that will tell us more

1232
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:26,040
maybe there's a way that can have more

1233
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:27,400
resonant transport I I I I right now I

1234
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,520
don't have a

1235
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,520
way to justify that as being a plausible

1236
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,520
mechanism

1237
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:42,000
yeah any other questions from the room

1238
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,440
sorry okay so I think um there's a

1239
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,559
question online asking about what new

1240
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,079
structures might be possible next with

1241
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:55,119
these layers and what sort of

1242
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,799
applications might you might you

1243
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:00,920
envision yeah uh um I think um you know

1244
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:02,920
the face space is like really large

1245
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,960
because I literally talked to you about

1246
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,720
two semiconducting

1247
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,760
layers if you look at the Periodic Table

1248
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,920
of 2D materials now you have like super

1249
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,319
conductors magnets semiconducting

1250
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,359
magnets there's a whole variety of

1251
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:23,400
insulators and um you can stack any of

1252
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:27,319
these guys on top of each other um I'm

1253
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,160
um you know I'm very uh excited for what

1254
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:33,400
the new structures can be U I think but

1255
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,960
the main challenge is just um our

1256
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,880
throughput I would say and trying to

1257
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,680
assemble these so another space to watch

1258
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,240
out for is just the synthetic part like

1259
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,760
how people are able to grow um on the

1260
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,440
application side um you know if you

1261
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,359
think about the oscillator strength or

1262
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,400
light matter coupling of these Atomic

1263
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:54,640
lethan layers um this single sheet of

1264
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,400
semiconductor at its fundamental

1265
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,640
resonance can absorb like 20% and 30% of

1266
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:02,200
light so you know an obvious space where

1267
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,880
you know whether it's light emission or

1268
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,760
light absorption any devices that use

1269
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,520
that that would be um an obvious space

1270
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,799
for

1271
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,720
applications um the other thing that um

1272
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:15,760
I haven't touched upon as much is that

1273
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,440
these are also very much tunable by

1274
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,760
things like substrate engineering or

1275
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,680
strain you know strained silicon you

1276
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,480
know enables a lot of our technology

1277
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,079
right like this is something that is uh

1278
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,480
should be explored in these as well and

1279
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,119
people have cre a lot of quantum

1280
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,839
emitters in these so yeah the Space is

1281
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:37,839
really large for sensing or emission

1282
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:39,640
yeah thank you um any last questions

1283
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,079
