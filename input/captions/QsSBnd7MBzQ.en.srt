1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,000
you ask AI to show you a vision of a 
sustainable future where materials and  

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,560
energy flows are balanced this is an example 
of what you get I specified Boston and you can  

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,120
tell because if you notice on the road there are 
cars driving in opposite directions in the in the  

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,680
same path with human bikers so so we know it's 
authentic but what jumps out to you about this  

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,640
image is the greenery covering every building 
absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere we  

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,800
never see this even though it's kind of consistent 
with every image we've ever seen about the future  

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,400
of sustainable cities and sustainable human life 
what's notably absent are solar panels solar  

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,800
panels which are typically vast arrays that I used 
to dream about as a high school student wishing  

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,560
to come to MIT and finding those solar panels on 
the side of the highways in my drive many of you  

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,200
probably passed those on your way here today that 
Vision has become reality but I'm going to tell  

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,400
you in a few minutes that it's actually breaking 
some of our sustainability systems goals we want  

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,440
our solar panels to be embedded in the material 
infrastructure and if you take nothing else home  

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,080
from this image is that we're actually very far 
from changing the way that we manage our energy  

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,040
and materials flows there is a huge materials 
burden associated with the transition to a more  

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,400
sustainable economy um and that brings major 
challenges that were poised to advance if we're  

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,880
going to meet the 2040 sustainable energy goals we 
need to extract four times the amount of material  

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,440
we have ever extracted on planet Earth this is ex 
exclusive of our steel and concrete needs this is  

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:12,360
just copper and manganese Cobalt and base metals 
that we're trying to use largely for our energy  

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,920
infrastructure our grid distribution and our 
Batteries Now the unfortunate reality is that  

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,640
in order to get those Metals out of the ground 
we need to build mines on this scale this is the  

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,640
grasberg mine it's on the order of 2,000 m across 
and over 500 M deep those Road cuts that you see  

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,560
the lines on the inside of the cavern those are 
driven on by tractors whose tires are three or  

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,240
four times as tall as I am now any of you who's 
ever tried to power something with a battery knows  

24
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,320
that there's no battery on planet Earth that gets 
you to the bottom of this mine and back out with  

25
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:01,080
a load of or on it you'd run dead in the first 
leg that beholden you to fossil fuel only fossil  

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,720
fuel gets you to the bottom of this pit and back 
out and it's that precise problem and related ones  

27
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,280
that means that all of our renewable energy goals 
tie us to carbon dioxide emissions we are beholden  

28
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,880
to carbon dioxide emissions until we rethink 
this problem and we rethink our materials demands  

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,280
associated with energy and energy production you 
can see this into intergovernmental panel for  

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,400
climate changes predictions for our carbon dioxide 
emissions that r line is the most likely scenario  

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,400
with the orange um drip lines around it projecting 
the uncertainty but what you notice is that we're  

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,600
actually not going to be very successful at 
decarbonizing and in fact meeting these two  

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:53,120
degre c curves requires that we be pulling carbon 
dioxide out of the atmosphere and at astronomical  

34
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,120
scale so if you note that green line that's the 2° 
C scenario um actually requires us to be removing  

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,880
on the order of 13 billion metric tons of carbon 
dioxide annually by 2050 now 13 billion metric  

36
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:17,120
tons is larger than the coal and oil and gas 
Industries combined and they had 200 years to  

37
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,360
do it we've got to start doing this within the 
next couple of decades it's an astronomically  

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,560
different approach to doing things in addition to 
decarbonizing our energy source and fortunately  

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,520
for you there are some great innovators today who 
are going to tell us a few of the strategies that  

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,880
we can get to do this first you're going to hear 
about dematerializing our energy production it's a  

41
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,240
really exciting Innovation out of blad bullit's 
lab so you'll finally get to hear him talk to  

42
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,000
you about his science and engineering Innovations 
then we're going to hear from Antoine alinor about  

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,800
how to more sustainably use the materials that we 
have already extracted let's not dig those pits or  

44
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,400
let's dig them in fundamentally different ways so 
that we can be more efficient about our materials  

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,480
processing and finally you'll hear from Rafa 
Gomez bombelli Who's going to tell you a little  

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,520
bit about how we might use advances in artificial 
intelligence to better design materials a priori  

47
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,680
and I'm hoping he'll tell you a little bit about 
the work he's been doing in carbon dioxide removal  

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,840
material Innovation which as I mentioned is 
critically needed to spawn an industry that  

49
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,320
doesn't exist within decades now how many of you 
have been able to see this beautiful piece of land  

50
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,640
behind the MIT Nano building okay a few of you 
but not enough later today when you're walking  

51
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,480
around campus go behind the MIT Nano building 
and you'll find this beautiful um piece of land  

52
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,800
that used to be the MIT junkyard you'd go there if 
you wanted to find bits of an engine which we all  

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,560
do we go different places for that now um this is 
named uh kindly by Vlad as the improbability walk  

54
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,160
it's named in honor of Millie dressle house the 
queen of carbon Nano science and there are two  

55
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,320
reasons for that name one is that Millie used to 
U Mentor her students on walks she was known as a  

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,360
as a great and supportive mentor and she would 
take them on walks during these discussions so  

57
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,480
this walk is specifically for that practice and 
for that reflection second improbability because  

58
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Millie used to say that her journey to being MIT 
Professor was as improbable a journey as any other  

59
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,040
she was the daughter of Polish immigrants who grew 
up in the Bronx and made her way to be Institute  

60
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,600
professor at MIT one of the first winners of the 
national medal of Science and many others uh we  

61
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,520
were fortunate to learn from her now the reason 
that I this up here is that that challenge that  

62
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,600
I just described to you is improbable but it's not 
impossible and I'm excited today to welcome Vlad  

63
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,960
bovich Antoine alinor and Rafa Gomez bombelli 
to the stage to hear the next few talks which  

64
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:51,800
we'll discuss after thank you all right um 
it's indeed a big challenge to figure out  

65
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:59,760
how to decarbonize the planet um in so many ways 
one way to provide you energy is to drill a hole  

66
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,720
pull the oil out of the well and burn it and 
if you do that you can use every molecule that  

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:16,480
you extract and from it gain about two three four 
electron volts of energy per molecule once as you  

68
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,880
turn it into carbon dioxide and consequently start 
causing issues for the planet what we have thought  

69
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,520
of is to ask another question what if I can take 
that molecule I have extracted in the form of oil  

70
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,760
out of the ground and what if that molecule can 
over and over and over again very say molecule  

71
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:46,040
give me the energy I need how would that work 
well it would work if you take that molecule  

72
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,160
and actually incorporate it as a tin film that you 
do not burn but because it happens to be very dark  

73
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:01,040
meaning it absorbs light very efficiently it can 
be used inside a solar structure layer an active  

74
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:09,640
layer of a solar cell every molecule we right now 
burn in our gasoline engines could be turned into  

75
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:20,000
a solar molecule and if such that film of oilbased 
material can absorb a photon and give you one to  

76
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,160
two electron volts of energy not once not twice 
but millions of times and the only reason why  

77
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,960
it would stop is because there is a probability 
that eventually after a million times of exciting  

78
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,120
and pulling out the charge out of that molecule 
you will eventually break a bond and that Bond  

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,720
consequently will cause that particular molecule 
not to be quite as effective as it used to be in  

80
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,880
making the sunlight turned into electricity 
carbon based materials that we extract right  

81
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:01,800
now and we do not need to add additional ones 
could be turned today into carbon based solar  

82
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,560
structures and indeed if you look at those solar 
structures there is an opportunity to ask well  

83
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,800
what should those solar structures sit on well 
how about carbon how about carbon-based Fabrics  

84
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,000
that again can be extruded made out of that very 
same oil the same petrochemicals that you right  

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,560
now spend once pull them out burn them you're 
done with them right now today if we change the  

86
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:40,200
Paradigm the value of every one of those molecules 
goes up by a factor of a few million because every  

87
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,520
one of them can be that much more effective in 
actually making an active structure that could  

88
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,600
never be previously done the goal what I want to 
show you in the next few slides is indeed examples  

89
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,320
of doing just that here's a picture of a solar 
cell here is a solar cell that's in that picture  

90
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:07,400
it's a piece of fabric that happens to have 
electrodes on it active layers on it and if you  

91
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,360
apply two electrodes here and here and C you know 
connect it to something while Shining Light on it  

92
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,440
you will indeed generate electricity it changes 
the Paradigm of what a solar cell could be and  

93
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,400
as a result reshapes the way we think of how to 
deploy such solar cells it turns out that the cost  

94
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:38,840
of a solar electricity is not in the cost of the 
solar panel that's the cheapest part of the system  

95
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,320
what cost you two-thirds of the money sometimes 
more is installing that particular system on  

96
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:51,960
your roof wiring it ensuring it's electrically 
safe because all of it is done in the field by  

97
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,200
a person who needs to climb on a roof and wire 
or electrically connect without Burning Down The  

98
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:08,280
House the set of panels if all of that can be done 
in a factory where you start with a fabric you add  

99
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,560
to it some solar material and make it as big as 
you want you need not need to wire it anymore all  

100
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,040
you need to do is climb on the roof staple it to 
the roof and through that generate a Deployable  

101
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,400
solar cell that simply plugs into your home it 
could change a paradigm quite significantly the  

102
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,200
other part of it is is we have enough installers 
to actually install all the solar cells that we  

103
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,400
want today if I gave you all the solar cells 
the world needs to power itself today how long  

104
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,080
would it take us to actually install them and 
deploy them the answer is a very very long time  

105
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,000
simply the amount of electricians and those who 
need to pour concrete and put aluminum framing  

106
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,240
on your roof that's a huge amount of extra 
work that we simply don't have the labor for  

107
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,920
If instead I can make you the laborer because you 
went to Home Depot got yourself a carpet unrolled  

108
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,280
it on your roof stapled it and plugged it on 
the side of the house dramatically increases  

109
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:20,240
the number of Labor Force we have to deploy and 
provide the solar deployment in the way we want it  

110
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:29,200
but the key to it is no wiring needed on your roof 
the key to it is unrolling a very light format  

111
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,920
solar structure and indeed that is the vision that 
we aimed for the Silicon solar c as we know it has  

112
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,280
looked like it looks today since 1970s essentially 
since it was invented the ones that were installed  

113
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,120
on the roof of Jimmy Carter's White House looked 
pretty much the same as the ones that you can buy  

114
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,040
today and install on your own roof that is not 
progress that is simply making technology better  

115
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,640
and better by efficiency but the efficiency will 
not give us the cost reductions that we need it  

116
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,240
will give us a little bit we are at about 20% 
efficient cells we might be able to one day  

117
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:15,920
get 25 30% efficient cells commercially available 
one and a half time Improvement or you can reduce  

118
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,360
the weight 100 times and consequently avoid the 
wiring avoid installation cost dramatically and  

119
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,280
through that reduce the cost of what would 
it take to truly make an active structure  

120
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,760
that could be Deployable starting back in 2011 
we worked with Professor Karen gleon in chemical  

121
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:43,160
engineering to use her chemically deposited 
calent bonded polymers conductive ones on top  

122
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,000
of pieces of paper to serve as a substrate on top 
of which to re evaporated carbon based molecules  

123
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,480
similar to the ones that are in your cell phones 
and are used for your organic LED displays oh and  

124
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,480
by the way oleds have been now around for 20 
years they've been commercially utilized for  

125
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,560
over a decade they are stable they can be used for 
million hours it turns out halflife carbon based  

126
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,240
solar materials can be similarly stable even 
more stable and should be able to be used for  

127
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,840
even longer time it's easier to make a solar 
cell than a display and yet we make displays  

128
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,040
readily why do I say it's easier to make a solar 
cell well because displays everyone looks at  

129
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,840
and you want every one of your pixels to work for 
a solar cell if I have a pixel or two section that  

130
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:43,840
doesn't quite work no one notices the yields are a 
lot more tolerant to actual large area deployment  

131
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,200
and hence imagining ways of deploying them through 
high throughput manufacturing unrolling them like  

132
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,240
this or at MIT Nano here's a coating of a thin 
film of material these are not carbon based the  

133
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,760
ones I'm showing you print here although this can 
be carbon based as well these are so called per  

134
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,080
guides also an extremely inexpensive readily 
available material these are options right in  

135
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,240
thinking how do we redefine what solar technology 
looks like and we have asked questions and what  

136
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,920
would be the ultimate reduction in weight one 
can imagine we made back few years back an a  

137
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:29,120
solar cell that is so light that it can sit on top 
of a soap bubble six watts per gram of solar cell  

138
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,680
that's remarkable amount of energy production with 
one little caveat which is it's only two microns  

139
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,400
thick as a device and hence if you pick it up and 
you don't handle it very nicely you'll break it so  

140
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,160
we've realized well maybe that technology though 
can be added onto a piece of fabric after all my  

141
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,560
shirt doesn't rip very easily and if I add to it 
a solar cell that solar cell would be protected by  

142
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,120
the fabric underneath and yet fabric is light 
and breathable and so we came up with this a  

143
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,200
method by which we can peel off a three Micron 
substrate off of a piece of plastic why do we  

144
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,600
start with a piece of plastic I need something 
to grow my extremely thin solar cell that will  

145
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,400
sit on these three microns on top of and so you 
can imagine chemically Vapor depositing the three  

146
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,840
Micron substrate adding to it the active layers 
the bottom electrodes the top electrodes and then  

147
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:34,120
transferring that onto a piece of fabric gluing 
it with another four microns of glue to make an  

148
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,320
active structure that when you shine light on you 
will be able to get a dramatic amount of power  

149
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:48,800
out of it as needed after all at the end you will 
make a structure that weighs about 1 gram and is  

150
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,440
about 50 microns in thickness about the thickness 
of a human hair all for the sake of deployment  

151
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,640
being extremely rapid and you utilization of 
materials being extremely reduced but keeping  

152
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,600
the part that matters the part that will absorb 
light and give you the electricity you need thank

153
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:22,320
you ask my colleague Elenor to join us next 
all right it's a pleasure to be here today  

154
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:31,160
um I'm going to talk very very quickly in 11 
minutes about a adventure that started 4 4,000  

155
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,800
years ago uh that is about Metallurgy that is 
about in that case copper and precious metal  

156
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,040
recycling or recovery um and I'm going to try to 
convey the idea that we perhaps need to change  

157
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,960
the chemical basis of our ability to recycle and 
extract Metals in the context that was very well  

158
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,920
presented before by desire um something you may 
not know if you are a producer producer or user  

159
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:09,080
of silver nickel manganese Cobalt Platinum um the 
recycling of those elements that are very you very  

160
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:17,080
heavily used in modern Electronics um is actually 
completely tied to primary production the tide  

161
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,360
might be on the price point because you're always 
competing with the price point of primary precious  

162
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,800
metal production but also comes in the recycling 
today the main facility that's going to recycle  

163
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,240
your electronic waste will end up being a copper 
smelter if you don't have copper smelter in your  

164
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,000
country you're going to have a hard time recycling 
electronic waste because the most of the value in  

165
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,760
the electronic waste are the copper and the silver 
now don't worry about the chart here it's just  

166
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,040
designed to be very impressive uh it's showing the 
amount of energy that is going on to recycle the  

167
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,160
silver that is coming from your electronic waste 
you can see how long it takes for the silver to  

168
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,520
come out of that supply chain and even when it 
comes out it usually comes out with gold a little  

169
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,040
bit of selenium and torium which means you need 
now to invest in another facility which economy  

170
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,320
depends on the four elements that I just mentioned 
now don't worry none of you are doing this most  

171
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,040
of the time you're shipping it abroad and you're 
waiting for somebody else to do that but of course  

172
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,840
the amount of energy and environmental impact 
of each of the box that you see here is actually  

173
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,880
responsible for some of the sustainability 
challenge that you've heard in the introduction  

174
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,680
now um in my group and many people around here 
at MIT including with the climate project are  

175
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:42,040
trying to think about using electricity with the 
assumptions that electricity can be made without  

176
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,320
greenhouse gases emission and with a mitigated 
environmental impact now if this is the case right  

177
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:56,640
if electricity is cleaning off and of course its 
price is good enough then most likely all of the  

178
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,600
materials challenges that we're talking about will 
be handled by electrochemistry and electrolysis  

179
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,040
now here is an example of a large scale 60 million 
tons per year electrolysis a manufacturing process  

180
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,280
which makes aluminum yes the aluminum you're 
using today is made 100% by electrolysis and  

181
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,880
yet it cost I think $2 per kilogram so we 
know that using electricity at large scale  

182
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,480
for materials extraction and separation is cost 
effective and it's supporting the economy and  

183
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,240
Society we live in now there are few technical 
details on that slide um is the fact that you  

184
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,960
don't want to separate the two compartments 
of your electrolysis reactor you may have done  

185
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,760
water electrolysis if you have not done so it's 
pretty straightforward to do in your own kitchen  

186
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,680
if you want but if you do water electrolysis 
you know you have an anodic product you see the  

187
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,720
oxygen gas coming out and then you see the famous 
hydrogen you know the expensive hydrogen coming  

188
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,520
on the other electrode and these two things 
have to happen but if you have a separator in  

189
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,560
the middle you have to pay for the energy cost of 
going through the separator and immediately this  

190
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,560
is not cost effective for most of the commodity 
metal production now there are other factors that  

191
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,000
are chemistry related there are factors related 
to manufacturing this needs to be a continuous  

192
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,800
process you need to constantly purchase electrical 
power and dissipate that electrical power  

193
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,200
as current in order to make the metal or recycled 
and get your metal back now there is a wisdom in  

194
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,760
electrochemistry and electrolysis at scale which 
says you should not do any pre-treatment to your  

195
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,560
feet stock that is something where there are 
discussions aluminum has the Bayer process  

196
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:59,120
which transforms boide into pure alumina aluminum 
oxide this aluminize 99.99% aluminum oxide right  

197
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,640
so that's a lot of pre-treatment that allows this 
technology to work how to do that is what I want  

198
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,200
to share with you today for other methods what 
we're doing in the lab is using Earth so geology  

199
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,840
shows us that for example if you look in the 
Earth crust where you have copper and the precious  

200
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,280
metals you have a natural separation between the 
oxide and the sulfides this separation between the  

201
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,400
oxides and the sulfides allows you to get today 
your ore to get copper for example this is an  

202
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,600
example here you may remember remember from high 
school the pyite calop pyite which is goldish and  

203
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,600
at the bottom you see the silicate which is quartz 
which is basically youran component so we know by  

204
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,680
Nature that if you achieve certain conditions you 
can separate chemically the precious and valuable  

205
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:51,560
Metals copper iron and sulfides versus deoxide 
now once you do that your entire chemistry is  

206
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:57,320
upside down again I'm not going to dwell too much 
on this but this is telling you that everything  

207
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,680
you know about ox side chemistry or waterbased 
chemistry is completely upside down once you  

208
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,080
do sulfide and sulfur based chemistry so that's 
that's the graph on the right here where you see  

209
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,800
that uranium is now very easy to make silver is 
much easier than copper iron is easier than copper  

210
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,560
and so on and so forth and that's what we've done 
in the lab in the lab we've basically developed  

211
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:28,440
a technique to transform any feed stock either 
a mix of ew or perhaps certain alloid or even  

212
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,880
minerals or waste from existing facility and 
we're basically substituting the sulfur with  

213
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,240
the oxygen so that we can then use this 
separation that I discussed before now  

214
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,560
we've done this here for the battery material 
you may know that the nickel manganese Cobalt  

215
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,200
batteries are oxides and there is a challenge 
to try to recover the lithium versus the Cobalt  

216
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,720
and the rest of it it depends on the market 
value and here we've shown that we can use  

217
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,160
sulfur to selectively Target the nickel and 
the Cobalt and leave behind the manganese and  

218
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,720
the lithium as salt that you can dissolve and 
we do that using sulfur and the processes that  

219
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,240
you're showing that is shown here now how do 
you now recover the Yellow Part which is the  

220
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,200
sulfide versus the Pink part you can use for 
example physical separation now suddenly we go  

221
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,720
back to the very small scale perhaps even nanoc 
scale interaction to figure out in what condition  

222
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:37,440
can you liberate the sulfides with the valuable 
Metals versus the non valuable oxides or sulfates  

223
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,040
once you've done that you have to go toward 
the metal you have to do electrolysis we have  

224
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,400
developed a unique technology molten sulfide 
electrolyses where no oxygen is involved in the  

225
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,360
system what you get at the anode the positive 
electrode is the sulfur yes the same sulfur  

226
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,400
from the previous slide which we paid for is now 
recovered by electrolysis while in the meantime  

227
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,520
at the cathode that's the bottom electrode that 
you see here we are making the liquid copper but  

228
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,800
we've also done it for other elements like ranium 
and um and and all of the precious metals above

229
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:20,360
copper this is an illustration of the recovery 
of the elemental sulfur so it can of become a  

230
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,280
material circularity problem we are initially 
consuming sulfur to get rid of the oxygen but  

231
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,000
at some point we can regenerate some of those 
sulfur by electrolysis and you can recognize  

232
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
your your famous yellow material that is 
this Elemental sulfur now we heard about  

233
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,200
scaling up how to do that at bigger scale uh 
we've been fortunate to do that with support  

234
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,320
of the federal government here is a 5 kgr 
per day capacity reactor where we can do  

235
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,880
any transformation of a mix into sulfides 
so example of utilization include the rare  

236
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,160
earth you may have heard about the magnet big 
problem how we're going to get the rare earth  

237
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,280
we can separate them and sidiz them on the on 
the right reactor and then on the left reactor  

238
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:12,080
we have the electris cell where we make metals 
from sulfide at a scale of about 2 kg per day

239
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,440
capacity now here is a picture of the outcome 
of the electrolysis at 300 G per hour scale  

240
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,240
you can see the liquid Copper at the bottom on 
the top you have the sulfide electrolyte and  

241
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,520
we have shown that this concept can be applied 
for the selective recovery of anything that is  

242
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:39,520
less stable than copper again this is important 
in the context of silver or gold recovery but  

243
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,960
also MIP denum uranium and perhaps The Rare 
Earth because now we can selectively design  

244
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,400
the process such that we recover first the 
most precious and valuable metals and then  

245
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:58,240
we go after the copper and then perhaps we 
go after the iron now we are trying at MIT  

246
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,040
in order to really demonstrate the viability of 
this we are trying to build a ton one ton 1,000  

247
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,360
kilogram scale capability I think you follow the 
track right we start at you know 10 milligrams  

248
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,480
we do one gram we do 10 gram we do 100 grams the 
typical path forward is to do a startup after that  

249
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,960
you can talk to me about this experience I've 
done it for 15 years now we've decided that we  

250
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,840
should go to the Thousand kilogram first before 
we can really t and collaborate further with the  

251
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,800
with the market of Finance so with this you have 
my contact here and I'll be happy to stay later  

252
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:45,680
to answer any any questions thank you for your 
[Applause] attention I I this I used to have a  

253
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,800
question here but you know if you have a question 
as a title then the answer is no so I have my  

254
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,720
answers AI for chemistry and materials we're 
getting there um and I think I don't need you  

255
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,320
know Des that was that was a killer introduction 
I I really loved it um so I don't need to say  

256
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,840
it again sustainability and decarbonization go 
through new materials Technologies and you've seen  

257
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,960
it takes decades since something works in the lab 
it's like oh this work this idea has legs until  

258
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,520
it makes it to Market and it's used by millions 
of people takes approximately 20 years so when  

259
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,240
we look at the 2050 objectives they're actually 
the 2030 objectives because we need kind of need  

260
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,280
to lock in a lot of the science 20 years ahead of 
of scaling it up um and at the same time we've all  

261
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,040
experienced something that's been transformational 
in our day-to-day lives at sort of you know five  

262
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,280
to 10 year scale like it's been 10 years in 
alphago right like I don't know if you were a go  

263
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,920
player this this whole world blew up and it hasn't 
been 10 years it's been barely 10 years since then  

264
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,960
um and then over the last three to four we've seen 
image generation right we thought you needed to be  

265
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,800
sort of artistically talented Ed to produce some 
images turns out the distribution of images was  

266
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,800
surprisingly easy to learn right a computer could 
learn how an image looks like from a text prompt  

267
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,040
in a way that was completely unexpected five 10 
years ago and then there's been this big big win  

268
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,120
in the Sciences with Alpha fall I mean we've seen 
it right two Nobel prizes in The Sciences went to  

269
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:29,720
AI one sort of to the AI technology in general 
and one to AI for protein exu prediction right  

270
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,160
and then you know if you're a scientist I am 
never writing a cover letter again I'm going  

271
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,240
to just ch GPT you know I've got my uh this is 
a high temperature super conductor an impossible  

272
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,520
thing maybe I've got my cover letter prepared 
uh to send to a journal if we ever discover this  

273
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:51,040
thing so what does this mean for materials right 
like you've heard it we need materials how how do  

274
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,920
we get these tools and point them to the sort of 
societal systemic challenges that that are ahead  

275
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,640
of of us and um this could look like batteries 
this could look like electrolyzers this could  

276
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,520
look like renewable Plastics this could look like 
decarbonization Technologies um what's different  

277
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,240
what's the same we're never going to have the same 
amounts of data right there is no way this the  

278
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,520
models the foundational models that we have access 
to today have been trained on all of the internet  

279
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,080
all of the text and all of the images that were 
ever taken even if they were copyrighted we we'  

280
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,400
already run out of data for for those models in 
The Sciences we don't have access to that scale of  

281
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:40,760
data and that's typically Silo you know Dow data 
is not going to be accessible to me uh if I work  

282
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:48,440
at dupon anymore right so all all this subtlety 
about data is very pervasive and I would postulate  

283
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,880
that we kind of know the rules of the game and and 
in the case of you know Professor Alor you just  

284
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,080
saw thermodynamics that's written in in in stone 
right like compared to that the rest of physics  

285
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:06,760
is stamp collecting in the words of rather for so 
how do we exploit that right such that when we do  

286
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,960
AI on chemistry and materials we get to exploit 
this sort of fundamental understanding of the  

287
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:22,280
rules and uh there's one more ler it's like okay 
somehow we need to coule our ability to evaluate  

288
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,440
hypothesis right like AI you know you ask CH GPT 
you know when I drop an apple do you think it will  

289
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,040
go down or up and it can give you a sense of what 
he thinks it will happen in the Sciences that's  

290
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:39,200
half of the job right coming up with a hypothesis 
is half of the job that happens virtually and then  

291
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,280
you need to test the hypothesis and that needs 
to happen in the real world right experiments  

292
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,080
need to be done data needs to be collected to 
inform your understanding of the world the way  

293
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,040
we traditionally do experiments is not the the 
most helpful way for the AI Paradigm to thrive  

294
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,480
and this is what we saw the big win Alpha fall 
protein structure prediction that was predicated  

295
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,480
on a carefully curated data set of 100,000 protein 
structures or 200,000 protein structures that have  

296
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,360
taken decades and and sort of tens of millions 
of dollars to collect so when the data is there  

297
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,600
AI can definitely shine but typically we need 
sort of these more data intensive pipelines that  

298
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:28,680
produce hundreds of experiments and and explore 
um millions of parameters search spaces and again  

299
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,960
how do we miss how do match that with the kind 
of conversation that Professor L was saying 100  

300
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,760
gr you know a ton a thousand tons how do how 
would we interplate that with the creativity  

301
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:48,160
and scale of AI so I would say things that are 
ready to go that are happening today if you have  

302
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,560
structured Property Data Machan model has changed 
how we go from the structure of a material or the  

303
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,160
structure of a protein you're going to he about 
nanom medicines this has completely changed over  

304
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,920
the last 5 to 10 years and one of the reasons 
is like AI Works in that space structur property  

305
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:11,680
relationships are functions that machine learning 
can totally totally learn so given enough data  

306
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,280
what is enough data it's probably more than 
a thousand data points right if I have more  

307
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,360
than a thousand pairs of this x goes to this y a 
machine learning model can do it for molecules for  

308
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,200
crystals or or for proteins as we've seen AI can 
predict how to make stuffff right that's that's  

309
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,840
kind of very important too because it's not enough 
to say well this material could have very good  

310
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,960
properties based on the model I just train now I 
need to know how to make it um and making is a you  

311
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:50,960
know an interplay of thermodynamics and physics 
driven driving forces and uh recipes and uh  

312
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:59,520
cooking in a way that that's very datadriven so AI 
can go read the papers process the literature and  

313
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,760
learn how to predict the synthesis of something 
from precursors that are commercially available  

314
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,440
through a series of steps this can be molecules 
or materials there is enough evidence out there  

315
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,200
that you can have an AI process the literature and 
like a student learn how to propose new synthesis  

316
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:24,440
for a material based on the synthesis of similar 
materials that have made before and lately with  

317
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,840
the with the outcome of uh of large language 
models we've seen this orchestration of pieces  

318
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,240
this coming and going has become a lot more 
smooth right so we can have an AI that has a  

319
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,720
piece has an agent that reads papers I have an 
agent that um runs a physics based calculation  

320
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,600
to get some thermodynamic parameters that may 
be very important and has another agent that  

321
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,800
goes and produces a synthesis plan and maybe has 
an agent that interfaces an instrument and takes  

322
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,840
a measurement so we've seen these orchestration 
papers um and these stration examples come up as  

323
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:06,840
as things that AI can do for us and uh something 
that is very dear to me and relates to the sort  

324
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:15,640
of astronaut on a horse riding on the moon is 
that AI can propose new designs right that's  

325
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:23,480
called inverse design that's called generative AI 
um this has been demonstrated for molecules this  

326
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,760
has been demonstrated for proteins I don't know if 
you've heard but there is a protein design company  

327
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,800
they raised a billion dollar a series meaning that 
you know some people are are willing to put their  

328
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,480
money where their mouth is in in protein design 
and it's work to for molecular for Atomic crystals  

329
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,040
like how do we arrange atoms to make a material 
that does something what has not happened quite  

330
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:53,360
yet well AI doesn't do anything in the physical 
world someone needs to do something at a milligram  

331
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,200
at a gram at a kilogram at a ton scale this this 
hasn't happened yet yet right the connection of AI  

332
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,280
with this very meaningful technological transition 
hasn't occurred right AI cannot convince human  

333
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,560
beings to change what they're doing AI cannot 
physically act upon the world yet so if we want  

334
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,520
that to happen there's a next layer of value 
creation very much along the lines that that  

335
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,400
uh Professor Alor mention in their own in their 
own work and then AI doesn't have any context we  

336
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,320
typically train from a inputs to produce B outputs 
all this context of our competitors are already  

337
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,200
doing that this is you know somebody else has 
this patent we cannot trust the supply chain for  

338
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:42,400
selenium in our own processes all those things 
would need to be put into the model explicitly  

339
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,920
right AI cannot decide what's important AI doesn't 
have a context for how the world Works in general  

340
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:57,000
so because um I got about a minute left I would 
say we've done the uh the beauty of AI tools  

341
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,720
and computation is that very agnostic so these 
are things that can be deployed systematically  

342
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,680
across materials classes and applications so 
this is uh CO2 capture so can we do better than  

343
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,960
current Technologies this is this gray band is 
how strongly current molecules bind to CO2 this  

344
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,240
is good enough for flu gas because there is so 
much CO2 that you know being okay at binding is  

345
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,600
enough you capture most of it because it's very 
concentrated if you want to do direct a capture  

346
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:32,080
you need to bind more strongly than the current 
molecules for the economics of of carbon capture  

347
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,280
to be effective so of all the molecules an AI 
could dream which are the ones that kind of make  

348
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,280
sense well we need to be more strong than this 
gray bars well it turns out this family don't work  

349
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,760
this families work and before we make a single 
compound we have a sense for like what's even  

350
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,160
doable what's even possible now which of these are 
expensive enough well that's another layer of uh  

351
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,560
of computation I got 10 second left so I would 
just say this is a material class that Professor  

352
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,040
Plata and I both like zeolites they're used for 
cracking they're used for Doo if you drive a  

353
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,560
diesel car same game we can use AI to explore 
the combinatorial space of how to make them  

354
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,520
uh and with this I will thank our sponsors thanks 
the team and thank you so much folks for for your

355
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:29,840
time right up to the stage andan and VD please 
join us on stage for a conversation um we have  

356
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:37,800
about 15 minutes I believe before the the end 
of the session um I like to say that there are  

357
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,880
many high privileges of being an MIT Professor 
um being able to train some of the best students  

358
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,640
in the world uh being able to get other MIT 
professors to talk to me um and of course  

359
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,920
interacting with people like you who are advancing 
the frontiers of Science and Technology in your  

360
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,280
day-to-day lives we are really excited to engage 
with you this morning we welcome your questions  

361
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,800
and the discussion um and and we'll go ahead and 
jump right in so I'll be keeping an eye on the  

362
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,040
audience for for any questions um from the room 
but I also have a few myself and um it's hard to  

363
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,840
know where to start actually you all um had such 
lovely context to share I think um I'm going to  

364
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:22,360
start at the top uh Vlad I find it interesting 
that you rely so heavily on carbon structures is  

365
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,200
unsurprising Right giving the focus of your work 
um human life also evolved to use car structures  

366
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,040
in in so many differential ways um what is your 
sense of this term decarbonization and how do you  

367
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,840
kind of think differently about about this and and 
what we actually need to be doing to refocus our  

368
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,840
efforts well U I'll start by simply saying one 
thing I really wish I told you at the beginning  

369
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,880
uh on the side screens there is a QR code you 
can scan it and you can type your questions and  

370
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,760
then the questions would also appear for us for 
the sessions and sessions to come pigeon hole is  

371
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,520
the method by which we can also get additional 
questions no literally right in front of me no I  

372
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,120
wish I have actually repeated it my apologies for 
not doing that to ask you a questionary and it is  

373
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,360
incredible to me to recognize that we do have the 
abundance of carbon and yet the only way we use it  

374
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:20,080
is either to eat it to make ourselves or to burn 
it um and in the electronics domains uh Millie  

375
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,960
dressle house was one of the Pioneers who have 
instructed us that if carbon takes certain forms  

376
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,600
it can actually give you electrical performance 
Optical performance that we couldn't have expected  

377
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,080
uh or at least we were not spending enough time 
on um the field of organic Electronics as first  

378
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:44,600
pioneered through the Practical use of A40 billion 
old olet industry really validated that uh there  

379
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:52,680
are more active electronic surfaces in a form 
of carbon based organic LEDs than of any other  

380
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,120
material out there silicon backplane maybe is the 
only other one that you can claim is there but  

381
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:04,400
there is more more amorphous organic being laid 
down than crystalline silicons has been laid down  

382
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,640
area wise and that gives us an opportunity to 
ask well for devices that do work on electronic  

383
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:17,160
principles but don't require an extreme speed is 
it possible to utilize carbon based materials to  

384
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,120
do what they do best which is absorb light and 
then from there on convert that light into slow  

385
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:30,800
moving slowish moving electricity but plenty fast 
to be able to be utilized for everyday use um I am  

386
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,360
very excited about carbon I do think that anything 
that's in the Earth's crust today easy to reach is  

387
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,320
the material we should touch and hence address 
your question on are we going to be in this  

388
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:49,320
Perpetual catch22 of needing to and spend a lot 
more energy to decarbonize the planet as we want  

389
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:56,160
it yes thank you um I failed to point out earlier 
that uh Vlad is a founder of three companies uh  

390
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,000
Antoine I think I think is on the verge or or I 
don't know are we allowed to say um and um but  

391
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,800
also worked in industry and for a mining industry 
before coming returning to MIT as did Rafa so the  

392
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,120
reason that I point that out is that these are 
folks who consider real constraints of of Economic  

393
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,880
and um and application space so feel free to push 
hard on them as you're formulating your questions  

394
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,840
because they can handle it um many professors 
live in the distant future we try to live in the  

395
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,320
the near-term impact of as well as imagining and 
ideating that future so uh to that point I want to  

396
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,240
bring up the concept of biom materials momentarily 
so Rafa nicely highlighted the advances that  

397
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,880
have been made in understanding predicting and 
describing protein folding structures you know  

398
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,240
when I think about my bones and I think about what 
this building is made of and my skin and what my  

399
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,200
fabric is made of again all formulations of carbon 
and carbon storage what is limiting manufacturer  

400
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,320
as you showed in some of your videos from being 
able to access the WID space of biomaterials and  

401
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,400
and all of you might have something to to add 
to this question so maybe Rafa I'll start with  

402
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:11,360
you yeah I mean I think the design space of biom 
materials is has been proven sort of completely  

403
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,520
expressive right there's lots of things the same 
building blocks can be put together to make sort  

404
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,480
of functional enzymes and collagen right so 
we can get mechanical properties we can get  

405
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,120
electronic properties we can get catalysis out of 
biomaterials right the most effective electroly  

406
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:36,200
um is the photosystem too it's an enzyme so I 
would say the language of biomaterials can express  

407
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:43,280
lots of function including structure the thing 
that's missing is that we don't have economic  

408
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,640
control of atomic Arrangements in the way nature 
does right the cost of making proteins the cost  

409
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:56,080
of making this highly engineer Nano structures 
the way life does is uh is just very high so as  

410
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,520
of right now you can make medicines mostly right 
because medicines can have sort of higher costs  

411
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,920
there is there's a lot of price that one can put 
into a medicine um but many other applications  

412
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,960
are limited not by the potential of biomaterials 
but by the cost structures and I think there is  

413
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:21,360
a lot of room over there to sort of industrialize 
um synthetic biology and biomaterials in general  

414
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,200
it's it's more I think the the potentials there 
the execution I think will need a will need  

415
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,360
technology that that doesn't exist today 
yeah thank you and could you just comment  

416
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,160
briefly on the role of robots you mentioned 
you know AI can't actually go and do in the  

417
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,760
physical world do you see robots as being able 
to tackle this challenge yes so this is this is  

418
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,960
a great question because theoretically there 
is no reason why armies of grad students and  

419
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,800
technicians couldn't embody AI you could imagine 
just like you know there was a guy moving the  

420
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,360
chess pces H when the AI suggests chess moves 
uh we could do that for the sciences and have  

421
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,120
armies of students doing things in The Labb turns 
out that's not how humans like to work right with  

422
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:08,520
we expect the AI Revolution for AI to do the 
minial tasks and us keep doing the more abstracted  

423
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,200
tasks not the other way around um and then human 
reproducibility you know when when you're doing  

424
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:21,760
sort of all these repeated laborious intensive 
experiments um reproducibility is an issue and in  

425
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,040
these two things robots are tireless right they 
they will operate consistently they won't lose  

426
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,960
motivations for instance negative data is very 
depressing you do experiments nothing works that's  

427
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,880
very depressing to a human being it's critical 
to have negative data to to train models um so  

428
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:44,920
in that sense uh the ability of robots to like I 
said work tirelessly and extremely reproducibly  

429
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,080
even if they're not faster than humans the 
tolerances are much much better than human  

430
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,080
reproducibility right we've seen I'm sure you've 
seen examples in your labs when two students you  

431
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,240
know one of them I don't know keeps the blinds 
open one of then keeps the blinds closed and the  

432
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,160
results don't line up for weeks until somebody 
realizes if everything's put into a repeatable  

433
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,840
process with a robot so I think that's what a lot 
of these sort of AI power science will most likely  

434
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:17,320
be enabled by or or cycled through Automation in 
the lab yeah thank you um I I want to just move uh  

435
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,520
right before we jump into the questions from the 
audience Antoine I wanted to ask about scale and  

436
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,200
so it's really clear to see how you know robots 
and AI help us accelerate Discovery and augment  

437
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:31,040
our own capab abilities um I I I really like the 
line that you used I think it was you know we go  

438
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,720
to the Earth and we learn from the earth um when 
we talk about planetary scale that is needed here  

439
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,440
uh just to put it into perspective people I just 
want to throw some numbers out there the the whole  

440
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,760
Plastics economy is around 400 million metric 
tons we think of that as a big huge um term that  

441
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,120
is small compared to the 51 billion metric tons 
of carbon dioxide emissions and that is small  

442
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,480
compared to the reservoir of carbon that is in 
the atmosphere on the order of 800 uh billion  

443
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,640
metric tons what you're doing with materials 
processing has to be done at enormous scale I  

444
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:09,560
just wanted to give you a moment to to comment on 
what the next steps are it's you know you said ton  

445
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,240
scale ton per what unit time and and what's the 
timeline um to getting to kind of meeting some  

446
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:21,360
important fraction of human material needs yeah 
this this is an important question so the the  

447
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,840
Paradigm that are out there for metal extraction 
today are based mostly on carbon hydrocarbon  

448
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:34,000
and gas solid reactions mostly and these things 
we can do them at very large scale like a blast  

449
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,120
furnace and all these high scale reactor if we're 
thinking about electrochemical methods we might  

450
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,440
rethink a little bit the logic of high volume 
because electrochemistry is a Surface phenomena  

451
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,320
and as such you would imagine developing reactors 
unit reactors which one of them would make make  

452
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,200
maybe 10,000 ton per year so it's like two order 
of magnitude smaller than the existing operation  

453
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:05,480
but you would multiply them very much like a solar 
array of of solar generation is a multiple of cell  

454
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,320
put next to each other we have to do the same 
thing but I think the scale has to be you know  

455
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:17,880
thousand times bigger than the bonus scale you 
can do for sale for solar generation for example  

456
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,880
so that's the Hope right now is we're discovering 
that in order to allow companies to be comfortable  

457
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,080
with those Technologies you need to show them 
like a module in a mod modle that is operating  

458
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:33,680
continuously for several days and weeks and 
months so that we can achieve what we heard about  

459
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,560
manufacturing because ultimately materials and 
metals production is a manufacturing process as  

460
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:46,360
well the metal that is coming out as very unique 
structure chemical composition and even physical  

461
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:52,080
features that if you don't achieve this you're 
not making steel or you're not making copper yeah  

462
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,040
yeah and I just want to highlight there these area 
requirements and volumetric requirements are enorm  

463
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,040
because of the surface area requirements of 
electrochemistry this is where nanomaterials  

464
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,520
are incredibly exciting because you can take 
surface large surface areas and Shrink them  

465
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,560
down you know to to the size of a coffee cup and 
hold them in your hand as Vlad nicely showed us so  

466
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,720
there's a unique role I think for nanomaterials 
to enable novel electrochemical cell deployment  

467
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,120
um and then the rest is is just multiplication 
so we can handle that all right um there's some  

468
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,800
very exciting uh uh questions uh coming down the 
line uh and and there's a hand in the room but  

469
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,040
I I want to make sure we have time to address 
this one that has a lot of votes um Hanuman are  

470
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,040
you in the room who submitted the would you mind 
reading your question sure I guess the question I  

471
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,360
guess had to do with with AI data access you had 
mentioned that it's currently accessed everything  

472
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,520
on the public available internet but you said 
there's Silo data by individual companies but  

473
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,200
uh I can see that there's a disincentivize for 
those companies to just all of a sudden give  

474
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,440
everybody access to their data how can we expand 
that access while still maintaining IP well it  

475
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,080
it's a extremely timely problem and actually 
for instance we've come back with Publishers  

476
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:09,280
Publishers used to be okay with automated access 
to their papers to their scientific literature  

477
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,480
and they're now holding it close to their chest 
so we kind of moved in the wrong direction with  

478
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,880
Publishers because they realize there's a lot of 
potential value that maybe they don't know how to  

479
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,040
capture but somebody else could so we've gone a 
little bit in the wrong direction with scientific  

480
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,480
literature over the last two years there's 
good examples in drag discovery particularly  

481
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:34,000
some some consortia in Europe where things are a 
little bit more toped down sometimes um and using  

482
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,440
tools um what's called homomorphic encryption 
which are computational tools this is an area  

483
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,880
of research of computational tools that allow you 
to still train machine learning models but on an  

484
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,320
encrypted data that can't be decoded back to the 
actual molecular structure that you're protecting  

485
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,880
right so everybody could train on sort of this 
Federated data sets but uh the models people don't  

486
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,040
have visibility to the actual sort of data because 
it's been encrypted in a way that still allows you  

487
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,320
to do machine learning but doesn't allow you to 
know what the what the data is so there are some  

488
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:15,680
examples around you know Federated learning ER 
consorti potentially pre-competitive research and  

489
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,160
homomorphic encryption but this is a place where 
sort of policy and uh economic interests of the  

490
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,840
companies are are sort of aligning right now there 
is no solve problem it's not just a technical  

491
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:35,600
problem uh and it's been worked out there is no 
singular answer yeah I F that back on everyone in  

492
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,400
the room to take that one home with them and it's 
a really it's a really great question and start  

493
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,800
to think differently remember how crazy we all 
thought Jeff Bezos was when he was going to ship  

494
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,080
us all our stuff for a hundred bucks a year and we 
thought this man's going to lose money but he got  

495
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,240
us all hooked on that right what can come by by 
liberating data um there's probably a lot to be  

496
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,400
had there okay so when uh I'm gonna a question 
to Vlad deployment cost of solar panels driven  

497
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,720
by install rather than manufacturing what part 
of that is physical install versus electrical  

498
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:09,880
safety um and as your solution mitigates the 
physical cost it's it's a great question I I  

499
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:17,000
guess I would answer it in U parabs I'm going to 
give you just a few examples to kind of consider  

500
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:26,200
one of them is the cost of a prefabricated home is 
half the cost of a home you built on site you can  

501
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:33,200
say a lot of money by asking to build yourself a 
prefab um why is that because of everything that  

502
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,560
needs to be done to make things just right is so 
much easier being done inside the factory than  

503
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:45,480
outside the factory result of it is that rather 
than installing your solar cells on your roof and  

504
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:51,000
wiring them on your roof pre-wiring them prior to 
deployment would be particularly powerful but the  

505
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,440
only problem is that today's panels weigh 25 kilos 
50 pounds a piece 50 pounds is the limit of what  

506
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:06,760
a laborer should be asked to lift and as a result 
we limit ourselves to that size one by 2 m not 20  

507
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,640
by 10 m that we could do if we could reduce 
the weight of the solar cell dramatically so  

508
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:19,000
the opportunity in redesigning the deployment 
would be dramatic second part is it turns out  

509
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,520
that everything in the world cost just about the 
same per kilo now that's a very strong statement  

510
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,280
and of course you can always come up with a way 
to challenge me on it I'd love to have longer  

511
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,840
discussions on it but the cost of items depends 
on the number of synthetic steps that you go  

512
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,520
through if you need to synthesize a very complex 
molecule that's going to be a very expensive one  

513
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,960
because it's going to take many synthetic steps 
and indeed the cost of objects scales with a  

514
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,520
number of synthetic steps avoiding the amount of 
matter you need to use will reduce your costs as  

515
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:01,520
well so combine the installation Paradigm uh when 
it comes to prefab versus not combine it with the  

516
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,320
reduction of cost and what's the right number to 
State in the overall reduction well I'll wave my  

517
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:14,120
hands and say it's going to be three times cheaper 
to install a solar cell if it's light uh compared  

518
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,360
to the way we do it right now am I correct on 
that number it very much depends on a whole  

519
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,480
bunch of details but I know that I'll need to use 
a lot less aluminum in order to reinforce my home  

520
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:31,160
and I'll be able to use a lot less concrete 
to prevent wind from blowing my solar cells  

521
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,560
away because that's the other thing we fight with 
the solar installation plus I'm going to open up  

522
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:43,640
areas we right now cannot which is Warehouse roofs 
that are not loadbearing and capable of carrying  

523
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:50,040
silicon solar cells but certainly would be 
available in millions of Acres quantities to take  

524
00:54:50,040 --> 00:55:26,680
on extremely lightweight cells thank you other 
I saw a hand in the audience yes please andur

525
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,840
so so is there any way to find

526
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:40,920
out I so yeah I mean we're back to the sort of 
Nano level control that life has over matter  

527
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,880
that we can you can barely replicate so I would 
say that's because every cell is much smaller and  

528
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,200
energy efficient than individual pieces of a chip 
right like I think it's we're going back to the  

529
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:58,760
sort of atomic control that nature has over 
is that that we don't necessarily have over  

530
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,800
manufacturing I think it's it's another side 
of the same coin I I I guess I would you know  

531
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,480
you're asking a very deep question that could 
be answered in a number of different ways we  

532
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,600
certainly do not operate our brains at the speed 
that the chips operate their brains that we also  

533
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:19,240
happen to have a cooling system in the form of 
liquid that computers don't and have avoided it  

534
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:25,520
to avoid shorts uh but that would also speed us up 
and reduce the amount of energy needed there are  

535
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:31,720
solutions that indeed we are working towards and 
our colleagues at Lincoln laboratory later today  

536
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:38,600
will tell you a few stories on how to speed up 
and reduce the energy of computation AI requires  

537
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:45,200
a tremendous amount of energy because we choose to 
use the cloud we are choosing to spend a lot more  

538
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,720
energy than we should right because every time 
that you send something to the cloud and receive  

539
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,680
it back you're using so many more turnovers of 
chips than it would if you just happen to do  

540
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:02,120
all the work on your local computer your phone so 
there are choices we are making right now to live  

541
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:10,120
the lifestyle we do that correlates to the excess 
energy consumption we have but we also wish for  

542
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:17,000
Chad GPT to write our uh introductory letters and 
if we stopped wishing that yeah we use less energy  

543
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,640
but we'll be less productive so energy is needed 
for the productivity gains that Society wishes uh  

544
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,760
can we speed it up absolutely uh today's ships 
can be about 100 times less energy consuming as  

545
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,920
compared to what they are we just need to reinvent 
them from scratch and you'll hear some of those  

546
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:41,080
stories yeah that's a really nice um summary it's 
really fundamentally different from the way that  

547
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:47,360
we've been been thinking and using them so far um 
I want to uh turn so I've lost the order switched  

548
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,480
on me I I Antoine I'd like to turn to you and 
ask is the a question from the audience is the  

549
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:59,000
process for metal recycling broad enough to apply 
to General unnown feeds um as in a one siiz fits  

550
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,240
most or is it actually necessary to know exactly 
what materials you're looking to to recover in  

551
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:11,360
the extraction process yeah this is uh this is 
an important Point um again this is all driven  

552
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:19,840
ultimately by the Purity and the recovery of the 
valuable things that you get from your Stream So  

553
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,040
if you don't know what's in your stream you're 
not going to be able to optimize the technology  

554
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:29,480
now that's a manufacturing statement very well 
known in terms of Technology themselves we are  

555
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,560
putting these materials in conditions that are 
unknown I think it goes back to can we predict  

556
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,400
the thermodynamics in those conditions the 
answer is no and as such it is possible that  

557
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:47,400
certain feed talk because of the presence of 
minor impurities might ultimately become more  

558
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,920
favorable than other feed stock in order to get 
the maximum recovery and selectivity so the answer  

559
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,840
is that the principles apply generally to any fet 
stock that industry mining waste manufacturer or  

560
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:06,680
waste generator might have but of course the 
the the devil will be in the details and you  

561
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,320
can only get access to those details once you 
have enough material to be processed I want to  

562
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:20,640
illustrate this with impurity right if you have 
1% of silver in your stream and 99% of the rest is  

563
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,280
not silver how long is it going to take us in our 
laboratory to show you what happened to the silver  

564
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,280
atoms how many grams of silver do I need 
to make until I can see them and say yes  

565
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:38,120
this is marketable silver for the London Metal 
Exchange and and and in that sense it's going  

566
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,760
to be tied back to whatever fit stock you're 
giving us and it is quite clear that some of  

567
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:49,240
them might be more commercially interesting than 
others even though down the line the economy of  

568
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:57,240
scale will make even the less profitable one at 
some point profitable yeah um okay so I'm gonna  

569
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,760
um pivot us for a second because I've I've heard 
it as a theme in a few different questions that  

570
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,440
are asked um but it's not been stated explicitly 
and the the statement that i' I'd like to throw  

571
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:18,520
on the table is that e e economics and prosperity 
are very tightly tied to CO2 equivalent emissions  

572
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:25,960
and as countries transition to being more postr 
excuse me um what is the word I'm looking for  

573
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:33,160
as prosperous thank you I haven't had enough 
coffee this morning so um as countries are  

574
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:39,200
engaging in that transition they're inevitably 
relying on Old Technologies not necessarily leap  

575
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,880
rocking to what we know is the best this comes out 
as a theme in cloud computing and the use of that  

576
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,960
for artificial intelligence calculations it comes 
to us as a theme in our materials um Recycling and  

577
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,080
and Recovery uh and comes to us as a theme as 
we think about how to meet the energy demands  

578
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:03,240
of those growing societies um Can Can you comment 
for a minute about how you imagine us having that  

579
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:12,120
sustained economic growth as we try to transition 
societies around the planet um without the carbon  

580
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:17,960
based emissions or equivalents associated with 
energy production so I guess I'll uh highlight the  

581
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:24,960
energy initiative work that was done a few years 
ago through the Tata center where the mission  

582
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,200
was can you frugally engineered technology that 
can be adapted by the other people in the world  

583
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,880
Beyond us living in a very comfortable environment 
where we are today if everyone in the world tried  

584
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,280
to live at the energy intensity of us in United 
States we would not be able to contain we would  

585
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,320
not be able to support 8 billion people we would 
be able to support only one billion people at the  

586
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,400
level intensity of consumption of energy as we 
have right now and so can we frugally engineer  

587
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:59,320
an option for the rest of the world and the 
answer is with that our work has been driven  

588
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:05,800
by coming up with a much more easily Deployable 
solar cell to me I think a individual there are  

589
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,880
billion of them who have no Road leading to their 
Village really doesn't care what's the efficiency  

590
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,440
of the solar cell that they are carrying on 
their back to Power their Village I think the  

591
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,240
only question they have is how many trips do 
I need to make to get enough energy to power  

592
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:27,440
my Village and there giving you more watts per 
kilogram me meaning giving your solar cell doesn't  

593
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,320
perform optimally like Silicon would but weighs 
100 times less is a value to them that will allow  

594
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:38,280
them to go ahead and deploy it much more readily 
the challenge though of today is that still they  

595
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:43,080
do not have the batteries they will opt for 
lead acid battery in order to store that energy  

596
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:49,400
and hence although we have some solutions there 
need more we need to be able to deploy more and  

597
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:56,120
hence yes the well-being of an individual in the 
country directly relates to the per capita energy  

598
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:02,440
use human development index the way United Nations 
will label it so give me more energy and I'll be  

599
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:08,800
more prosperous right but give me more energy I'll 
be emitting more CO2 as well uh come up with a  

600
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:14,760
lightweight or indeed Deployable technology that 
can easily be adapted because it's doesn't cost  

601
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:20,320
very much by many that becomes something that 
of course will win over the others yeah so you  

602
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:25,560
highlighted in your response the value proposition 
to the individual the service that they're looking  

603
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,360
for from that energy not so much kind of agnostic 
to where it's coming from and then to use what's  

604
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:34,240
available and I think that's really interesting 
how we provide that service I'm wondering if we  

605
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:40,840
could hear from antoana RAF on your responses to 
this this notion I'm trying to think when when  

606
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,280
these things come up I was try to to sort of think 
what are examples where this has worked before  

607
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:51,960
like are there instances where societies have S of 
liap frog the bad decisions that we learn were bad  

608
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:59,680
and and I think you know it might be a a testament 
to you know other issues like the competition with  

609
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:06,280
China but I would say electric vehicles in China 
it's true that the grid has a lot more cold in  

610
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:12,720
China than than we would maybe aspire to but 
electrification of Transportation has sort of  

611
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,080
happened at a pace that it hasn't happened here 
right like so I would say that's an example where  

612
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:24,160
a where a society has maybe leap frogged internal 
combustion engines and straight up going to uh to  

613
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,240
electrified cars at a faster paace that us sort 
of early adopters have um and then you know maybe  

614
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,880
Boston's you know we have the first Subway in the 
in the world right so we have one of the oldest  

615
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,160
and worst looking Subways in the world so maybe 
it's one of those places where early adopters are  

616
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:47,040
locked in in h what are ultimately bad choices but 
you're committed now so I think electrification of  

617
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:51,600
the vehicle Fleet in China will be an example of 
of lip frogging a little bit I don't know if if  

618
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,720
you folks have can come out with other examples 
Antoine I I wanted to ask you specifically as you  

619
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:02,120
think about materials and energy flows is there 
a way for you that you think about using AI to  

620
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:08,880
solve these really complex global scale problems 
not necessarily I don't know about the global  

621
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,880
problems but for sure the materials processing 
industry was the first one to use AI because we  

622
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:21,480
make steel at 30 cents per kilogram at 1 billion 
tons per year so there's no more places where we  

623
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:27,440
have data all the time and we optimize constantly 
all the processes to make sure sure we can improve  

624
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,320
now how is it going to help for completely new 
technology will be dependent on the sensors and  

625
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:39,000
the quality of the technology we deploy okay um 
I'm going to take one we're we're technically  

626
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,040
out of time but I want to finish with one final 
thought from each of the speakers um and then I'm  

627
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,120
going to give you a little bit of homework because 
you've come to MIT and that's it's a requirement  

628
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,360
so um as you leave today I want you to go home 
into your industries and think about one thing  

629
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,120
that you can do to advance sustainability the 
constraints are that it has to be done within  

630
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:04,360
the next 3 months so it's a thing that you can do 
within the next three months small definitive uh  

631
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:10,200
finite take it home and uh and it needs to advance 
uh sustainability initiatives in your specific  

632
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,720
role so achievable today send send an email make 
a phone call propose a solution something that  

633
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,920
you've been thinking about I'm going to give you 
30 seconds to write it down as I'm turning to my  

634
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:25,560
colleagues for their closing thoughts we're going 
to count to 30 everybody we can do it one two okay

635
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,880
I should see you all

636
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:47,600
writing okay you're committed to it now it's 
it's in writing um the last question that was  

637
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:54,320
on the screen at the end is what do we need from 
our industrial Partners so as I've given you all  

638
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,720
homework we're now putting some some homework on 
our plate to go out and and Shake three hands for  

639
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,880
for the mission um what do we need as academic 
scientists working with our industrial Partners  

640
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,520
yeah I think what are the real world important 
problems at scale right sometimes it's it's a  

641
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:16,120
very especially for for computational science like 
what is you know should we doing doox for diesel  

642
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:22,600
or doox for ammonia combustion like it's what 
what are sort of the big strategic needs and I  

643
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:27,400
think those are often times not you know there's 
no paper saying and this is the most important  

644
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,400
thing in our industry right now um so those types 
of sort of pointers of where where do we point all  

645
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,880
these tools right how do we translate how we make 
the effort of translating uh these agnostic tools  

646
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,160
into real impact in your industries that's very 
hard for us to know so I would say that's that  

647
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:49,760
type of guidance is extremely helpful and and I 
expect useful uh two things I think I've seen the  

648
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,200
question about what do you need to know about our 
waste and our materials produced in manufacturing  

649
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,240
that is is definitely something you should bring 
up to us so that we can verify whether or not  

650
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,800
our approach makes sense for those materials but 
then the second aspect is your supply chain right  

651
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,480
where do you buy it from in what form what are 
the specifications of the things you're buying  

652
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,800
that you're using in your manufacturing which 
then makes the waste because there are some gems  

653
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:20,520
here there might be ways that our technology 
might work very well for 5,000 ton 10,000 ton  

654
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,880
but if you don't tell us we will not find it uh 
engag us uh this is not a one-way Street where we  

655
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:33,480
get rules from you we solve the problem we pass 
you the answer back uh the more we talk to each  

656
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:39,720
other the more we'll be able to make ideas that 
Blossom beyond what either us or industry can go  

657
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:45,920
ahead and do on their own human friction leads to 
Innovation let's generate more and more reasons  

658
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,560
to be together and consequently come to these 
events become members of various organizations we  

659
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:56,440
are invite us to come over so we can go and tell 
you stories that the best best way we think that  

660
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,000
could be done it is this event and events like 
this that are indeed designed to hopefully give  

661
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,040
us a reason why we exist as academics we're not 
just here to train amazing people who will then  

662
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:13,040
change the world we are here to also generate 
the best ideas but those ideas are particularly  

663
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,600
powerful if we get your input and get you as a 
partner as we develop them yeah so thank you for  

664
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,840
co- innovating with us this morning um this 
is great advice to take forward as you move  

665
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:47,360
through the rest of the sessions today thank 
you again to my speaker Che thank you that's
