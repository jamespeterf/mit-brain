1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,359
Good morning everyone. Um, great to be

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
here and uh, thanks again to ILP for

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,440
inviting me. I'm here to talk a little

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,400
bit about um, some of the exciting

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,480
things we see going on in networking and

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
space and uh, edge computing. So, we'll

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
get get to it. So, this is what I like

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,880
to call the cloud above the clouds. Um,

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,439
and we'll we'll get to why, but lower

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,000
launch costs and now we've got some

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,239
competing rellanding vehicles, reusable

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,920
launch vehicles with um, new Glenn um

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,680
improved manufacturing in the north

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239
orbit where we can really get to

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,360
flatpacked commodities of scale in terms

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,280
of satellite fabrication and um, you

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,040
know, just

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,559
commercial line production of many

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,960
satellites.

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,640
Um, and now that we are getting to the

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
point where we can directly connect to

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,199
our consumer devices and we have the

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,000
3GPP making modifications to the

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,520
standards to allow for the latency and

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,479
power management um that is necessary to

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,640
enable this. We're really enabling

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,640
global connectivity. So what's next?

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,240
Um,

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,320
so today we have on orbit we have

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
sensors, we have communications, and we

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,479
have radio down links or radio frequency

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,560
RF down links. Um, and we have all of

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,400
our compute on the ground for the most

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
part. We take data, we send it down for

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
analysis. We send up commands, we take

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,479
more data, we send it down to the

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,200
ground. Um what we're going to see

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,960
happening increasingly um as these

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,720
backbones of communication get

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,479
established in space is more on orbit

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,079
decision- making inference making

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,520
dynamic tasking um where the sensors are

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,720
gathering the insights on orbit making

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,600
decisions on orbit retasking on orbit

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,079
and sending information down and a much

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,159
lower volume just the insights that you

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,360
wanted and needed for the most part to

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,960
to the ground. Um we're enabled to do

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,360
this by some of the technologies that I

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,720
just opened with. And um what we're

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,319
going to see, I think, is this motion of

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,720
um decision- making and autonomy um edge

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,959
compute and inference on orbit. So I'm

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
calling that cloud above the clouds um

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,959
because we're we're really getting to

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,640
that point, which is exciting. But why

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,720
now? So what's why is this all happening

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,200
now? People have been talking about

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,520
dynamic tasking and autonomy and orbit

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
for a long time. So what is falling into

61
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,360
place right now and what are the

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
opportunities that we have um that

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
enable us to make you know some pretty

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
great advances which I'll get to at the

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,200
end. Things that I'm really excited to

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,120
be working on. Um so we have these low

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,599
earth orbit LEO mega communications

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,080
constellations. they're there. Um, with

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
the lower latency and the global

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
coverage and the remote access over

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
ocean, over land, um, they still want to

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
optimize for where the most customers

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,400
are, but still the capability is there.

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,640
Um, we have enormous data volumes that

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
are being generated from high resolution

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,720
earth imagery, hyperspectral imagery,

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,319
synthetic aperture radar which can see

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,080
through clouds day, night. Um we have an

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,120
really significant advances in

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,120
onorbiting compute and running AI

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
machine learning models on board

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,599
satellites on really capable commercial

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,280
processors um on orbit right now. Um, we

84
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
can do this in low earth orbit, perhaps

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,959
a little bit more challenging at higher

86
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,720
altitude orbits like um, medium earth

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,879
orbit where the GPS satellites are or

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,680
geostationary orbit where a lot of our

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,200
communications transponders are um, just

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
because of the radiation environment

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,680
further out. But in low Earth orbit, we

92
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,040
can do this. Um, we don't really need,

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,319
we're getting to the point where we

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
won't really need to down link

95
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,000
everything. will be able to run things

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
on board and make decisions and see, oh,

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
you know, I was tracking the shipping

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,239
container with this ID number with this

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,239
tracking number and I saw where it went

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,439
and I got the update on its latest

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
status. So, now I'm going to go on to

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,360
the next task or I didn't get that

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
measurement, but you know, two

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
satellites down, going to fly over in

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
about 15 minutes, I'm going to pass that

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
task backwards and we're going to try to

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
get it with that one and see if they

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,680
have clear cloud coverage. I didn't get

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
it. So um deciding and delivering on

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,919
orbit is going to become more of a

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,919
thing. Um we have laser inter satellite

112
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,240
links between the satellites right now

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,000
um to augment the radio frequency cross

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,639
links. Radio frequency has a bunch of

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080
challenges that I'll get to. Um and I'll

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
talk more about laser communications

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,960
work that is being done at MIT and MIT

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
Lincoln. Um and we have come to the

119
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,240
point where we're really getting to

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
programmable space where we can have

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
really targeted satellite services, not

122
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
just sensor data dumps down to the

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,479
ground anymore. we can start to really

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,479
configure things dynamically.

125
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
So the challenges that we need to

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
overcome that we'll we'll talk through

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
but we're we're getting there is limited

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,199
power. So being able to operate really

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,040
efficiently thermal constraints in space

130
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
there's no convection. You know all

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,440
these images of your workstations or

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
with fans to cool the chips doesn't work

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
like that in space. You either have

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
pipes to move fluids around or you have

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
radiating panels to cool your chips. Um

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
so thermal constraints are an issue.

137
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,160
Precision pointing. So, um, anybody

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,759
who's ever given a presentation with a

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
laser pointer knows that like trying to

140
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
keep the dot on the on the screen can be

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
a little bit of a challenge. And just

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
imagine that at thousands of kilometers

143
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
to hundreds of kilometers distance,

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
right? And trying to do that with free

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,120
floating satellites that have other

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,800
things going on. Um, they're moving. So,

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,039
you have Doppler shifts and um,

148
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,880
handoffs. Um, you have some latency that

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,360
you have to deal with, gaps and timing.

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,000
You can't have everything on a regular

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,160
um, periodic time schedule. Um

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
regulatory is a huge issue for both

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
spectrum and imaging as I think we're

154
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,960
all aware. Um really bandwidth challenge

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
for spectrum and imaging is um often

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,160
very inconvenient and requires a lot of

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
paperwork and tracking. Um we have

158
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
weather that we need to deal with for

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,479
the ground down links. Um and we want

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,160
the autonomy to be reliable and cost

161
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,520
effective. It doesn't do us any good to

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,880
have autonomy if we have to have a

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
standing army to make sure that the

164
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,919
software works all the time and the

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,039
hardware gets replaced and isn't broken

166
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,720
or the procurement pipeline is you know

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,919
stable and we don't have to redesign our

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,800
boards every six months. Um so and then

169
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,240
we also want to deal with

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
interoperability and I have some ideas

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,919
on that across fleets and platforms that

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
I'll get to later with federated um edge

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,160
compute and of course security. So these

174
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
are these are the challenges that you

175
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
know are MIT level challenges that we

176
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
can help work on.

177
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
Um, so I'm going to go over some of

178
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
these building blocks, just a few of

179
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,759
them, not all of them. That's a big

180
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
list. I'm just going to focus on a few.

181
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,680
Um, so Lasercom, um, the

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,319
non-aterrestrial networks, um,

183
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,919
protocols, um, on onboard and edge

184
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,280
compute, and submission apps, and then

185
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,560
then we'll go through, um, some others,

186
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
and I'm happy to talk about some of the

187
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
others, too. So, the challenges that,

188
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
um, some of these address are really

189
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,000
regulatory, security, and jamming. Those

190
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
are those are some of the big challenges

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
that we're overcoming to make this

192
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,960
happen. One of the ways that we're doing

193
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,599
this is with these inter satellite laser

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,199
cross links in low Earth orbit. So, um,

195
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,440
the way I like to think about this is

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
laser communications on orbit from

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,919
satellite to satellite where you don't

198
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
have to worry about weather because

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,280
you're not down linking it. You're just

200
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
going satellite to satellite. It's not

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
really replacing radio. I don't want to

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,120
think about it that way. Radio is

203
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,880
extremely valuable. Um, but it's more of

204
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,800
like imagining the Ethernet fiber that

205
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,560
happened when the internet started to

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
really take off here on the ground

207
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,759
happening up there. So that that's what

208
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
we're seeing. We're seeing this

209
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,160
high-capacity spine in a space internet

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,759
come into being that's making these

211
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
modern satellite networks behave like

212
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,720
cloud backbones, fast, secure, scalable,

213
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,919
and RF is going to keep us or fan out,

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,639
our last hop um universally available

215
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
even with weather. We can use optical

216
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,479
for some of that as well and I'm I have

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,240
I have ideas on how to do that too but

218
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,440
um and and have been working on that but

219
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,680
um RF for the laptop is is good. So um

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
we have these laser interatellite links

221
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,639
um again space equivalent of optical

222
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,560
fiber and then we have the changes to

223
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,919
that 3GPP has been putting together for

224
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,599
the 5G and then future 6G um pro

225
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,000
releases. So the non-aterrestrial

226
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,919
network. So um this is having a base

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
station on satellites on aerial mobile

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,800
platforms your user equipment or your

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,639
cell phones. And they have um reduced

230
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
capability internet of things and

231
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,520
directto device connectivity all built

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,080
into the new releases for this um user

233
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,240
equipment and um base station hardware

234
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,640
which will make it easier to connect to

235
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,200
more platforms more effectively than

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,519
we've we've been able to do before. Um

237
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
and then there's been a huge

238
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
proliferation um although the

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
availability and pricing is sometimes

240
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
not exactly what we want for the onboard

241
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,640
AI and edge compute um chipsets um

242
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,320
there's some great chipsets that are out

243
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,600
there that we can fly and have flown and

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,080
have been flying and demonstrating

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,040
onboard satellites um from GPUs to

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,680
FPGAAS to AS6 that can do tasks like

247
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,519
feature recognition classification

248
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,600
um you know lots of different models

249
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,880
that they can run um that we have run

250
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,640
even on demonstration platforms

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,160
So, um, with the laser angel satellite

252
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
links, there's really, like I said, no

253
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
clouds to get away get in the way of

254
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,720
space-to-pace links. You can get over,

255
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,320
um, well over a 100 gigabits per second

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
per cross link. Sometimes they do this

257
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,920
with multiple colors of light at the

258
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,240
same time to you can't get all the all

259
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,959
the bits in one color. But, um, the

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
beams are very narrow, which means that

261
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,480
they're secure. You're not going to

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,440
bother other people. The coordination

263
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,519
that you need to do is minimal. Um

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,399
there's very low regulatory burden right

265
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,080
now. Um unless you happen to be, you

266
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,040
know, a government program in which case

267
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
you need to coordinate with your

268
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
government friends, but other than that

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,399
there's very little regulatory burden.

270
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,120
Um but you have to be able to precision

271
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,120
point your um your terminals online and

272
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
they're pointto-point and there are some

273
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
great technologies that we use here on

274
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,399
campus to do that. Um steering mirrors.

275
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,760
Um there are micro electromechanical

276
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
MEMS steering mirrors that we've been

277
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,080
using on some of the terminals. Um, and

278
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,480
these are these are things that we we've

279
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,120
been working hard to do that enable uh

280
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,640
more cross links to overcome some of

281
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,480
these data problems. What I'm what I'm

282
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
showing on the top here is a you know

283
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,240
finding the other guy is hard. So the

284
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,160
green beam is a wider beam to do the

285
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
search with and then you can switch to

286
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,360
your narrower data beam once you found

287
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,959
your other link. Um there are um you

288
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
know some of the links on orbit links

289
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,320
are being made and unmade at the level

290
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,600
of hundreds of thousands of links being

291
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,320
made and not made and unlin orbit. um in

292
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
lower lith orbit today. So the the laser

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
comm cross links that are out there are

294
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
linking and unlinking like crazy.

295
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
They're doing a good job of it. It's

296
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
very reliable. This is a problem that

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
people have um been working on and have

298
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,320
solutions to. Um this is just a quick

299
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,519
example of a little um program that we

300
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,120
have at MIT for NASA doing a instead of

301
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,000
a larger satellite crossing doing them

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,000
very small on little nano satellites. So

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
this is a program called click b and c.

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
We already did click A with a down link

305
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
to a very small telescope in in a shed

306
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
in Westward. The students um didn't like

307
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,440
that in the winter. It was kind of cold.

308
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
But um the cross links, we won't have to

309
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,640
worry about the shed quite so much. And

310
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,079
so this is some hardware that that we're

311
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
building just as an example of some of

312
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,120
the hardware that you can build to do

313
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,760
this on on campus or working with

314
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,360
campus. Um so for the 5G

315
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
non-aterrestrial networks, I mentioned

316
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
that 3GPP is been modifying their

317
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,279
releases to include this um

318
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,279
non-aterrestrial capability. It it

319
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,519
handles things like Doppler shifts from

320
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,959
relative motion of your platforms. You

321
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
don't want the user end to have to deal

322
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,600
with this. You don't want to have to

323
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,600
modify your mobile phones. You want the

324
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
base stations to have to deal with that.

325
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,560
Um there are modes without um hybrid

326
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,079
automatic repeat request, which you'd

327
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,240
think you'd need for these platforms,

328
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,760
but it can be really um difficult to

329
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
implement and maintain when you're power

330
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
and resource constrained. And so it's

331
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,959
that this reduces latency and conserves

332
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,040
the resources on um on your devices. And

333
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,959
then there's this idea of grant free

334
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,680
which allows you to send packets without

335
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,680
having to preschedu them. Um so there's

336
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,480
a lot of these capabilities that are are

337
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,440
being incorporated into the new releases

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,040
um for 5G and then future for 60G that

339
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,519
will enable um our user devices to be

340
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
more connected to um satellite and

341
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
aerial platforms. So these are things

342
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,320
when we're planning for our new

343
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
capabilities that we want to build into

344
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
our systems. We want to plan for this

345
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,639
hybrid capability both the optical cross

346
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,760
links and the user devices connecting.

347
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,680
Um so in in the past we used to have

348
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,639
just uh transparent or bent pipe

349
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,240
capability where basically bent pipe is

350
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,680
like the idea of the pipe is you send

351
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,440
the data up that goes right through the

352
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
pipe and comes back down somewhere else.

353
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
Right? It's just kind of like going

354
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,040
through a pipe. Nothing changes in the

355
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,800
middle. Um, right now we're looking

356
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
towards in the newer releases in release

357
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
19, we're looking at um, this new

358
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,279
capability where you send data up and

359
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,880
you can do something with it. You can

360
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,200
modify the frequency it's at. You can

361
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,079
change some of its properties. You can

362
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,920
change where it's going. Um, and you may

363
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
be able to like amplify, retransmit,

364
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,040
change the data, multipplex things in

365
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,959
and out. Um, so these are things that

366
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,720
you'll be able to do in some of the new

367
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,920
releases which will allow some of this

368
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,079
onboard decision-m retasking um

369
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,399
reorganizing of things as well as doing

370
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
that up there and and also incorporating

371
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,160
connecting it with the users down on the

372
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,160
ground. So these are things to again to

373
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,480
keep an eye on um that that I think will

374
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,079
be really enabling um that we want to

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,959
make sure we're we're incorporating into

376
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,320
our future planning. Um this is a real

377
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
eye chart, but I'm just going to talk

378
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
through it really quickly. There's a

379
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,920
longer paper on this that I have linked

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,399
if you guys want to um see it. But these

381
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,800
are just like going through ways that

382
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,279
you can use AI on a satellite, right? So

383
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,959
AI as the parent category, subcategory,

384
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,040
machine learning. There are different

385
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,560
types of AI. These are the yellow boxes.

386
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,000
Constraint satisfaction, supervised

387
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,600
learning, unsupervised learning,

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
reinforcement learning, evolutionary

389
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
algorithms. We went through all the

390
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,680
reasons, you know, methods that you

391
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,680
might use, the tasks from assignment to

392
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,399
classification, clustering, anomaly

393
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,160
detection, optimization, the different

394
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
algorithms that you could use for each

395
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,639
of these different tasks. And then the

396
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,199
easy part to understand really is the

397
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,079
example applications from planning and

398
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,600
navigation, scientific prediction, cloud

399
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,000
filtering, feature extraction,

400
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,560
spacecraft health management, navigation

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,079
and tracking, um configuration

402
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,480
optimization. These are all the things

403
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,959
that you know at a high level survey we

404
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,959
could think of to do with AI on board

405
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,959
and that we can start implementing now.

406
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,240
Um this is just a one example when we're

407
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,240
implementing an multimodal. So we're

408
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,120
taking satellite images. Multimodal

409
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,800
means not just color images but also

410
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,160
thermal images um maybe SAR or radar

411
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,760
images and we're fusing them together um

412
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,079
as they're coming into the model and

413
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,360
we're using them to do a classification

414
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,279
task to find something um to locate a

415
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
topic and decide like you know did this

416
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,839
task get completed or not did I see a

417
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,760
flood is the flood increasing to a

418
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
certain level that I'm worried about do

419
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I see wildfire boundaries changing do I

420
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,839
see crop growth vegetation being

421
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,360
affected by weather by a certain level

422
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
that I'm concerned about that I want to

423
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,720
report back. Um so these are things that

424
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,240
um you can do on board. So you would

425
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,800
take the data in and you would um use uh

426
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,440
in this case you know different types of

427
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,120
um machine learning models from um

428
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,839
neural networks to um genetic algorithms

429
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,000
different ways to to use the different

430
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,399
models and get out on the output your

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,560
your inference the information that you

432
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,320
cared about. So you you've trained it

433
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,839
you train it on the ground for the most

434
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
part although I have a later example

435
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
that I'm going to talk about that that

436
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
we move a little bit of the training on

437
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,880
orbit but just weights changing but for

438
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,880
the most part you do a lot of the heavy

439
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,800
compute on the ground and running the

440
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,639
models on orbit isn't as compute heavy

441
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,959
and it's capable your your processors

442
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,839
are capable of doing this you're just

443
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,360
running them. All right so um a little

444
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,720
bit more about the autonomy and resource

445
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
scheduling. So this is a fun little

446
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
animation that um one of our our loud

447
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,480
students made um where I like I was

448
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,720
saying you can cover unpredictable

449
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,160
phenomena, cloud cover, wildfires,

450
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,680
weather events um and you can tackle you

451
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,320
know where you're taking the image and

452
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,759
when. So this um method um is actually

453
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,440
avoiding clouds. I have a different

454
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,560
student who wants to cover clouds for

455
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,800
understanding um earth's climate but um

456
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,600
but this is just going through an

457
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,680
example um where we have um on this

458
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,440
slide we have all the black dots are

459
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,759
unobserved activities um the red is it's

460
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
using data cloud masks that it's getting

461
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,519
from some of the go weather satellites

462
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
that are available every 15 minutes

463
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,279
globally or for you can patch that are

464
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
global for the most part um and you can

465
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,680
decide okay of my activities, which ones

466
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
are cloudy, which ones are clear, and

467
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,319
then you can task the satellite as it's

468
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,400
flying along. It compares its path and

469
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,880
its tasks against the cloud map. It

470
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,640
makes decisions of what's the most um

471
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
useful thing to do, and it goes for the

472
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,600
green dots um which are the the tasks

473
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
that it's um trying to track. So, this

474
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,720
is the actual model of the algorithm

475
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,319
working um could be run on board. And

476
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,919
you can see it, you know, doing the best

477
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,679
it can, kind of almost like a video game

478
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,400
trying to win all the green dots. not

479
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,559
quite Mario Kart, but um the satellite

480
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,039
version of it. And you can you can have

481
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,360
um multiple ways of implementing this um

482
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,960
with um gathering your your queueing

483
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,240
data or your masking data depending on

484
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
what you care about. In this case, it's

485
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,240
clouds. Um this is the student who

486
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,640
wanted to track clouds on purpose. So,

487
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm just showing hers as well. Um so

488
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
that you can see that if you did want to

489
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,000
track clouds for some reason, if you're

490
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
a scientist or you you cared about where

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,039
was going to be overcast, maybe you have

492
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,280
a reason for for using the clouds. um

493
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,919
then um then you can do that. Um this is

494
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
uh work that we've done to use machine

495
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,400
learning models to look at the telemetry

496
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,720
streams. So on board the satellite just

497
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
like on board your computer it has logs

498
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,559
and data that it's coming out from your

499
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,080
hardware at all times kind of its status

500
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,000
and it's just reporting. The satellite

501
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,840
does that too. It's called its telemetry

502
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
streams. It's housekeeping telemetry.

503
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,480
You can actually have a machine learning

504
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
model running on your housekeeping

505
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
telemetry and instead of thresholding,

506
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
which is what we do now, alarms go off

507
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,039
if we go above or below this level. Um,

508
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,120
you can actually have it look for things

509
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,400
that are unusual, behaviors that you're

510
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,320
taking that aren't typical for your

511
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,360
normal behavior. And it can send alerts.

512
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,559
It can infer what went wrong. And um,

513
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,880
we're getting to the point where it can

514
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,160
even make decisions to self-correct. So

515
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,600
instead of just powering down and

516
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,360
calling home for help, it could do

517
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,440
something more intelligent to reduce

518
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,320
downtime and improve uptime and improve

519
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,760
um um customer service. So um here we're

520
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,559
using ensemble learning and decision

521
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,320
trees um XG Boost in particular to

522
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:01,039
implement something like this on board.

523
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,360
Um the there's also this idea of

524
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,160
federated learning in low Earth orbit.

525
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,200
So, um, you have this, we're getting to

526
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,240
the point where we're going to have this

527
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,520
connected network. Um, and they want to

528
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,559
coordinate with each other, but they

529
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,720
don't want to tell each other

530
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,480
everything, right? You might have some

531
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,120
proprietary information that you don't

532
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,440
want to share. Um, but you want to

533
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,039
contribute to an overall good and you

534
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,760
want to, you know, get something from

535
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,840
the other team's data. Um, but you don't

536
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,360
want to share everything with them. So

537
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,320
what you could do is have a small global

538
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,480
model that you could pass with your

539
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,280
cross links between your different

540
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
vehicles and you could train it on the

541
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
data that you have locally that you

542
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
think is valuable or the insights that

543
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
you have locally that is valuable. You

544
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,440
could adjust the weights and then pass

545
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,440
it on to the next guy. So the model gets

546
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,160
updated. Your actual data doesn't

547
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,760
actually go into that update but

548
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,840
everybody benefits from the improved

549
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
performance. So this is an idea of

550
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
federated learning in orbit where we can

551
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
have our satellite constellations

552
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,600
coordinate with each other and work with

553
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
each other without necessarily giving

554
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,160
all the information away. We can do this

555
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,120
on the ground too. Um but the idea of

556
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,400
doing in space is pretty cool. Um and so

557
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
instead of moving data around to a

558
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
central server, you send the smaller

559
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
models across the other spacecraft. you

560
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,280
you run training on it with the data

561
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,039
that you're willing to share and um the

562
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,919
model gets updated and sent back around

563
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,400
to the folks who are part of the club.

564
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,039
Um we're also very interested in using

565
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,120
um autonomy on board to make bigger

566
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,679
things in space that are more useful,

567
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,280
bigger antennas, bigger imaging systems.

568
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,159
Volume in a rocket is really costly and

569
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,760
constrained. Um, so we we can, you know,

570
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,919
start to think about, okay, well, what

571
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,200
if instead of putting the big thing in a

572
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,799
rocket, having it be a one-time

573
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
deployable like the James Web Space

574
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,919
Telescope, what if we just built it up

575
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,360
there? Um, and so we're looking at some

576
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,440
ideas now of using um less humanoid

577
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
robotics. You could use arms, robotic

578
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,400
arms and things like that, but the six

579
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,640
degrees of freedom, they can be a little

580
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
costly and complex. You can do this much

581
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,720
more simply like we do in factories now

582
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,520
with automated assembly. these XYZ

583
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,760
cartisian robots that we see in um you

584
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
know manufacturing companies, car

585
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
companies assembling things and putting

586
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,120
them together. You can send up a

587
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,600
satellite with one of that those systems

588
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,039
on it um with full of parts. Basically,

589
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,400
this is one that's full of tile parts

590
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,679
that it's packed together to form a

591
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,240
large flat surface. Um and you can put

592
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,640
those in this in the um rocket instead.

593
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,440
And you can use um and train models to

594
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,880
build lots of different things with

595
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,559
these um tiles or with these um systems

596
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,760
that you can you can assemble together

597
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,159
on orbit.

598
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,360
>> We're we're prototyping it. It's at the

599
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,440
um kind of sandbox toy level in lab

600
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,200
right now, but yeah, we're it's

601
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,440
something that that our our group's been

602
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,440
working on.

603
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,039
>> Um we don't have a launch yet. We're

604
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,200
This is like very early stages, but

605
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,760
happy to talk if people are interested.

606
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,280
Um, James Dingley is wonderful. He also

607
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,799
is a really well-known YouTube

608
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,799
communicator. If you haven't seen any of

609
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,080
his videos, they're fantastic. So,

610
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,760
definitely check out some of his work.

611
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,280
He's one of our students here at MIT.

612
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,080
We've got some great students and he's

613
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,600
very dynamic and very very got got some

614
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,640
great work out there that's not the

615
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,440
robotic assembly as well. Um so future

616
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
roadmap we're doing optical cross links

617
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,120
now and we're getting to the point where

618
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
we have basic AI and autonomy on board.

619
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,799
Um we're looking to develop more

620
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,480
multi-satellite ground station routing

621
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,400
and advancing the autonomy making the

622
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,840
tasking more complex more useful um and

623
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,400
doing more for resource management power

624
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,400
um thermal as well as network management

625
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,360
and the ability to quickly recover on

626
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,880
orbit. Um, I would love to get to the

627
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,280
point where we enable federated learning

628
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,640
on orbit. Maybe this like more secure,

629
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,640
less open, but still valuable sharing of

630
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
models and updating them among multiple

631
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,400
parties. Um, you can imagine different

632
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,919
types of groups of companies that might

633
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,280
be interested in doing something like

634
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,679
that. Um we should be working on um

635
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,000
radio interoperability with the new

636
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,240
non-aterrestrial network um protocols

637
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,640
that are coming out um so that we can

638
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,520
have um interoperability both between

639
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,240
the platforms and the user devices as

640
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,400
well as interoperability between the

641
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,679
operators. Um I think we'll we'll really

642
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,039
be at a point where we can start moving

643
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,520
forward when we're not so constrained

644
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,039
about who's working on whose network. Um

645
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,880
and then this new idea of um

646
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,480
self-healing capability and self-aware

647
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,039
connectivity. So in addition to

648
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
monitoring your telemetry for um

649
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
anomalies, wouldn't it be great if you

650
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,240
never had to write another software

651
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,919
device driver in your life because the

652
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
packets come in, your model can look at

653
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,679
the packets, figure out what packets

654
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,919
they are and write the code it needs to

655
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,159
interpret them on the fly instead of

656
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,559
having some software engineer only write

657
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
the interface to one thing and then it

658
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,720
doesn't work and you don't know what's

659
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,240
going on. And um so yeah, I one too many

660
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,200
issues with USB on my side. I'm a little

661
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,880
I'm a little bitter. Um, okay. So, I'm

662
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,559
just wrapping up ways to work with MIT

663
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
on this. My group or any of the others.

664
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
I know Ali Dwax's group who spoke

665
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,919
earlier is working on this as well as

666
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,080
several other faculty member here on

667
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,840
members here on campus. The ILP program

668
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,679
is a great way to do this. Um, you can

669
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,760
sponsor graduate research on campus. So,

670
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,760
some companies work my group directly.

671
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,559
You can sponsor undergraduates to work

672
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,000
with us on campus. And there's also a a

673
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,360
high school and undergraduate training

674
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,720
program called the Beaverworks program

675
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,559
that you can get involved with for the

676
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
younger students depending on when you

677
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,799
want to start grooming your workforce

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,400
pipeline. Um

679
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,720
you can um collaborate on calls for

680
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,360
proposals with us um with uh the faculty

681
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,200
members as PIs. Um we're more than happy

682
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,960
to connect you with our students to hire

683
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,400
as interns over the summer. And then we

684
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,240
actually have students available for the

685
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,919
entire month of January every year. So

686
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,400
not not all schools have that but

687
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,039
January every year the MIT students are

688
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
available for internships. Um you can do

689
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,760
non-resident graduate student

690
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
sponsorship where the students have

691
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,559
completed all their classes and then

692
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,080
they basically just go work at your

693
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,000
company while working on their PhD

694
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,679
degrees as as advised by their adviser.

695
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,559
The adviser has to go along with it but

696
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,159
it's possible to do that. Um we're happy

697
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,440
to invite you here to give seminars.

698
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,080
We're happy to invite you to give

699
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,640
lectures to our grads and undergrads. Um

700
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,000
we're happy to go talk to you. Um, ILOP

701
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,960
is great about trying to get us to do

702
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,080
that and um, I you know,

703
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,000
getting through fighting through our

704
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,440
email streams. Um, I know these guys

705
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,600
work really hard at that to get in touch

706
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,679
with us, make sure we we spend some time

707
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,320
and then we can also spend sbaticals at

708
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,919
at your institutions as well. So, um,

709
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,279
with that said, I I just wanted to close

710
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
with I you know, I think there's a lot

711
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,960
of a future in cloud computing and a lot

712
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,720
of things we can do uh on orbit above

713
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,919
the clouds and I'd be happy to keep

714
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,919
working on that. So, thank you.

715
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,760
Question time. Any questions over here?

716
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,919
>> Carrick,

717
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,600
good see. Um, uh, unman submersible

718
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,200
have, you know, flooded versions and

719
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,120
then ones that are fully pressurized to

720
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,320
protect everything inside of them. You

721
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,000
compute at higher altitudes. Could you

722
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,080
just, you know, if you didn't want to

723
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,360
have to rag hard everything, could you

724
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,320
build a box? Um

725
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,120
the question briefly.

726
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,480
>> Yeah. So the question was um at altitude

727
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,559
does everything really need to be

728
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,600
radiation tolerant or can you um put it

729
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,799
in a box with either pressurized gas or

730
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,960
put it in um some type of um metal

731
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,440
container to help protect it. Um the

732
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,159
answer is it that can sometimes help. Um

733
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,559
sometimes not. A lot of the radiation um

734
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
is very high energy meaning it goes

735
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,919
through just about anything. If you try

736
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,840
to put metal around it, it will just

737
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
make secondary radiation. So it'll hit

738
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,120
the metal and then there'll be a cascade

739
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,000
of more radiation coming off the metal

740
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,240
on the other side. Um so so sometimes it

741
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,400
helps, sometimes it doesn't. Um it kind

742
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,039
of depends and how much mass you're

743
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,919
willing to put on there. Um and um so

744
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:02,480
how thick and um the pressurized vessels

745
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,760
also um make everything more expensive.

746
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,760
My problem with pressurized things

747
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,440
because of the safety concerns. Um so

748
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,679
when you go up on a rocket they really

749
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,279
don't there's this rapid change from you

750
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,840
know um surface air pressure to vacuum

751
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,520
and that that's over the course of like

752
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,480
90 seconds and they're very concerned

753
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,039
about leaks and damage to um things on

754
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
board. So so sometimes sometimes you can

755
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,880
um and some sometimes you you may not be

756
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,279
willing to take the mass or cost hit for

757
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,360
doing that.

758
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,640
This may be too broad a question, but if

759
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,880
you think about like you mentioned the

760
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,720
confluence of factors that lead to the

761
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,360
why now and there's like the pointing

762
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,240
there's the laser that exists in the

763
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,320
academic world and like the FFRDC world

764
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,400
and there's like a normal pipeline to

765
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,880
tech transfer for like the radons and

766
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,480
bees of the world which then like begs

767
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,720
the question where do you see I guess

768
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,799
the economic opportunity for like the

769
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,600
startup ecosystem to take advantage of

770
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,039
this like new economy versus uh the

771
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,960
incumbent so to speak.

772
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,840
>> Yeah. So, so the question is like with

773
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,120
the the things that are happening now,

774
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,720
the new capabilities um and outside of

775
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,399
the institutional pipeline to um FFRDC's

776
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,679
to research, how do you know licensing

777
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,760
through universities or big

778
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,360
organizations? How do you get more

779
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,080
startups involved, more commercial space

780
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,039
involved? Um MIT does have a technology

781
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,799
licensing office and um most of the

782
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,399
students here are open to the idea of

783
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,640
supporting startups or doing their own

784
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,240
startups. I know several that that are

785
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,720
um as well as the faculty, myself

786
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,720
included. Um so I think I think there's

787
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,320
a there's a lot of opportunity um to

788
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,399
have the people here be interested in

789
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,559
working on it. The other half of that is

790
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,360
making the case for return on investment

791
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,279
and commercialization and product to the

792
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,679
investors that we need to support the

793
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,279
work. um that that is finding the happy

794
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,799
medium in between where there's a

795
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,720
product and a customer and a number of

796
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,960
units and a you know return on

797
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,960
investment that they're expecting um

798
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,640
compared with the technology that you're

799
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,840
promoting is takes a little bit of

800
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,240
working out. Um so I think I think one

801
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,480
of the things that could speed that up

802
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,799
is having more conversations and more

803
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,159
clarity among the young people who are

804
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,679
working on this and really want to do

805
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,320
it. Not all of us are young, some of us

806
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,760
are older, so I won't be agist, but um

807
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,840
but having a little bit more clarity

808
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,840
about like exactly what's expected, what

809
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,799
bars they have to hit in terms of um

810
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,120
being investable. Um that that that is

811
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,080
almost as clear as the tenure process

812
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,679
rules here for most people. Like not

813
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
very clear. Nobody's really sure where

814
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,159
to hit. It kind of depends who you talk

815
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,600
to and what you're working on. So I

816
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,760
think more clarity there would really

817
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,960
help speed things up. But you know,

818
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,520
human human engineering is another

819
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,520
another challenge. Um yeah. Could

820
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,159
the learning systems talking about one

821
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
day be used like if you had the

822
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,799
automated robots to build satellites,

823
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,080
could it be used to kind of train them

824
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,159
to make fixes inside the system of

825
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,760
robots working together? Yeah, I think I

826
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,159
think it's really valuable like you're

827
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,640
saying exactly for um information and

828
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,760
knowledge sharing that might not be

829
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,640
fully transparent but mostly transparent

830
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,039
and sharing skills. Um imagine if you

831
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,559
had a bunch of mechanics who you know

832
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,760
had a central knowledge base that they

833
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,440
passed among each other. They don't want

834
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
to give all their trade secrets secrets

835
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,520
away but they might give some right to

836
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,480
try to encourage people to use their

837
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,720
business. Um so yeah you can you can

838
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,399
think of it like that. Um, and I can

839
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,919
definitely see that applying to onorbit

840
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,200
assembly as well, where, you know, you

841
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,080
have one system that's putting this

842
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,840
together. It's had this level of

843
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,200
success. It knows what its issues are.

844
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,320
It knows what its challenges are. And

845
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,679
that has been um put into a machine

846
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,279
learning model. And then those

847
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,520
parameters passed and shared between

848
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,960
three or four, maybe more different

849
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,039
groups that are doing the same thing,

850
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,399
and they're all able to build on it. So,

851
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,399
I think I think that would be really

852
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,399
valuable.

853
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,360
>> Yeah. Uh I remember you mentioned that

854
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,039
the training will be done on the ground

855
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,520
before

856
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,480
it is launching on on the orbit. I I

857
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,279
guess once it is on the orbit, can we

858
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,840
retrain or retrain the model so that it

859
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,840
can do something different from what it

860
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,760
was originally trained for?

861
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,480
>> Yeah, I mean if you have enough compute

862
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,039
capability, you certainly can. Um, I

863
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,840
think sometimes that can be one of the

864
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,840
most comput intensive parts of using

865
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,399
machine learning, um, is is the

866
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,279
training. Um, and so if you're planning

867
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,120
for that andor you have the time, um,

868
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,399
it's possible to do that. So I'm not

869
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,880
saying you can't, I'm just saying, you

870
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,600
know, the efficiency is is a different

871
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,519
hit than just running the model.

872
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,200
>> Yeah. So the the question was, um, can

873
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,440
you retrain on orbit? Um, yes, thank you

874
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,440
for the reminder.

875
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,720
Anybody else?

876
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,600
I guess we're good then.

877
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,600
>> All right. Thank you very much.
