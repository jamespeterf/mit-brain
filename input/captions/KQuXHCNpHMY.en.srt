00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,319
after checking in the students get

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,400
introduced to a technique called nuclear

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,960
magnetic resonance or NMR for short NMR

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,400
helps chemists piece together a molecule

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,119
structure the students put their mystery

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,240
molecule into a thin tube and lower it

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,279
into a very powerful magnetic field this

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,560
forces certain atoms in the sample to

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,560
align themselves either with or against

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,560
the field aligning with the field takes

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,920
less energy so there are a few more

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,680
atoms aligned with than against the

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,520
field a pulsive energy makes the extra

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,480
atoms aligned with the field flip the

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,559
computer measures how much energy this

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,640
takes and produces a spectrum the amount

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,680
of energy it takes to flip an atom

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,600
depends on what other atoms are next to

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,719
it that means you can tell which of the

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,760
atoms are connected and put together a

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,000
picture of what the whole molecule looks
