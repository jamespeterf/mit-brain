1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,400
Okay. So my plan for today is to start

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,279
off by showing you how to derive the

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,960
generating function for Catalan numbers

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,080
and then I will show you how to find the

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,079
formula for Catalan numbers using the

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,960
generating function and finally I will

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,200
um you know answer questions for you

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,559
know

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,719
because we're having a Thursday And

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,120
this Catalan number generating function

11
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,879
is not going to take the entire hour and

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:56,000
a half. I will um throw the floor open

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,879
to questions about what to um no about

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,879
material for the test. And so the test

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,559
covers everything we've done so far. I

16
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,920
don't think there are going to be any

17
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:12,720
Catalan number generating functions on

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,560
the test. So, but you know seeing the

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,920
material for today is not going to hurt

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,000
you on the test because it's more about

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
generating functions.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,640
Okay.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
So recall that the Catalan numbers

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,200
counted a whole bunch of different

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,200
things and

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
Catalan

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,000
numbers

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
count

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,000
binary trees

30
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,600
or maybe I should say rooted binary

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,600
trees.

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,799
So

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:07,240
here are the five rooted binary trees on

34
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,240
se seven nodes.

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,520
There we go.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,680
So C sub3 equals 5. And they count dick

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,680
paths.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,800
So dick walks were walks that never went

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:39,800
below zero and go from zero to 2n. So

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
for

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,640
for C3 there should be five of them. And

42
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,640
there are

43
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,160
um wait I want to go up twice down and

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,000
then over

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:06,840
and down here. Let's do up down up down

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,840
down and up down down down down.

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Okay. So how would you get a generating

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,840
function for Catalan numbers?

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Well,

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,200
you want some kind of recurrence.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
And

52
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,959
so,

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,440
well, first let's start out by looking

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,560
at binary trees.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,360
So a binary tree

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,280
well unless it's a binary tree on one

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,000
node it starts with a vertex and there

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,239
are two

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
um

60
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,760
you know there's a two branches because

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,239
in our definition of binary tree every

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:08,000
vertex has two branches coming out of it

63
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,799
and now on this branch we have t

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,799
Let's call it A and this branch we have

65
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,799
TB

66
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:23,079
and suppose

67
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,079
we want to say count C subn

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,080
um

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,960
let's say C subn which is the number of

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,120
binary trees on

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,199
um

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,800
2n minus3 nodes I Yes. No. 2 n + one

73
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,000
nodes

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,479
is going to be equal to sum j = 0

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,360
through n minus one

76
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:58,360
c subj c n minus j minus one. Why?

77
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Well,

78
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,479
number of possibilities

79
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,280
for this tree is C subj because it's

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,400
just a smaller Catalan number. And if

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,360
this side

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:29,880
has 2 J minus one nodes, this side must

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,880
have two N minus J minus one nodes.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,039
And so this is

85
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,039
number of possibilities

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,320
is

87
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,320
two sorry is

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,039
c sub n minus j minus one.

89
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,120
And when you combine these two trees and

90
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:04,319
add a node you get

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:08,160
uh Catalan number C subn.

92
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:12,960
So C subn equals summation J= 0 N minus

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,880
one CJ C N minus J.

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,039
And we can check that if you want with

95
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,600
the Catalan number three

96
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,319
I'm sorry five

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,199
13

98
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,600
um

99
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:36,000
14. Sorry, I cannot remember my Catalan

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:43,759
numbers. So here 14 should equal 5 * 1 +

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,800
2 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 5 and it does. So

102
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,440
this recurrence checks out.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,680
So now you know this recurrence.

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,840
How would you

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,240
write down a formula or an equation with

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,240
C of X?

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,360
I = 0 to infinity

108
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
X

109
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,280
to the

110
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,759
N

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,759
C subn.

112
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,720
So what's a

113
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,720
equation for C of X?

114
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Anybody?

115
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,039
>> Yeah.

116
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:54,319
>> Yeah, exactly.

117
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:56,240
um C of X is equal to C of X

118
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,960
squared. Actually, this isn't quite

119
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,000
right because if this is J and this is N

120
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,440
minus J minus one, this is N. So, we

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,639
need to add another X here to make the

122
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:15,199
degrees, right? And um

123
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:22,879
this isn't quite right either because

124
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,800
c of x starts 1 + x + 2x^2 etc. And this

125
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,080
side is divisible by x. So this side has

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,800
one in it. So we need to add one for the

127
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,440
initial condition.

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,200
And now we have an equation. It's a

129
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,120
quadratic equation. We know how to solve

130
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,120
quadratic equations. So let's do it.

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Um

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,160
c of x

133
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,640
is equal to

134
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,640
um

135
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,560
well let's put this quadratic equation

136
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,640
in the standard order. C of X^2

137
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,360
- C of X + 1

138
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,920
= Z.

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,920
And we have

140
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:23,839
1 that's minus B plus or minus<unk> of 1

141
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,519
- 4 A C that's 4x

142
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,880
over

143
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,760
2 a that's 2x.

144
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,320
Okay, so there's two possibilities for

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,040
this. How would you figure out which one

146
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,040
is the correct one?

147
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,680
Any suggestions?

148
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,680
Okay. So what is

149
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,680
C of

150
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:16,399
what do you get when you substitute

151
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:19,760
x = 0 and c? Well, you get 1 + x + 2 x^2

152
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,560
+ dot dot dot, you get one. So if you

153
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:28,959
substitute x= 0 in here and you have

154
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,680
the plus thing you get 2 / 0 which is

155
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,920
infinity. So that's not right. If you

156
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,760
substitute the minus term you get 1 - 1

157
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,160
/ 0

158
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,279
which might be right.

159
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:48,240
And you can easily check with calculus

160
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:52,000
that limit as x goes to 0 1 -<unk> 1 -

161
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,760
4x over 2x

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,600
um

163
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,600
is equal to 1.

164
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,519
So the right

165
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,519
value is minus

166
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Okay.

167
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,600
So, how do you evaluate this?

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
Well,

169
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,640
to get the tailor expansion of this, you

170
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,640
use the binomial theorem. Binomial

171
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,640
theorem

172
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,640
use binomial theorem.

173
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,880
Um so what the binomial theorem says is

174
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:07,480
that

175
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,480
um I guess 1 + a to the k is equal to

176
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,959
1

177
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:21,519
+ k choose 1.

178
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:25,360
A + k choose 2 a 2 + k choose 3 a cub

179
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:29,200
plus dot dot dot

180
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:35,680
And it's also true for fractional values

181
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:38,959
of k. So 1 + a to the 12

182
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,079
is equal to

183
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,079
um I guess 1

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:55,360
+ 1/2 choose 1 a

185
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:59,399
+ 12 choose 2 a 2

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,399
+ dot dot dot

187
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,959
Okay.

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
And of course you have to take this and

189
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,800
subtract

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,800
it from one and divide by 2x.

191
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,920
So

192
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,720
um

193
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:35,760
so I'm going to do 1 -<unk>

194
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,639
1 - 4x over 2x. So that's the generating

195
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:43,680
function for Catalan numbers

196
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:46,959
is equal to 1 / 2x

197
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,320
and there's a one here as the first term

198
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,320
but it gets canceled by this one. So we

199
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,560
don't have a constant term which is good

200
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,600
because we don't want a 1 over 2x in our

201
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,600
expansion. So the next term is

202
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
um

203
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,160
12 * - 4x

204
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,880
+

205
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,720
12. So

206
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:26,800
12 choose 1 = 12.

207
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:29,519
12 choose 2 = 12 * - 1/2

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:37,839
/ 2 factorial

209
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:42,295
12 choose 3 is 12 * -2 * -3ves

210
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,279
/ 3 factorial etc.

211
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:45,680
>> [clears throat]

212
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:55,480
>> So this is

213
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:55,480
12 * - 12 / 2 factorial - 4x^ 2ar.

214
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,480
Okay, I have forgotten the minus sign

215
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,000
here because of the minus there.

216
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,800
Plus

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,800
12 - 12 - 3

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,040
over three factorial

219
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,800
and there's a 4x cubed.

220
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,040
So let's put that here

221
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,480
and a minus sign.

222
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,720
>> [clears throat]

223
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
>> So the first thing you can check is that

224
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
all of these terms are minus are

225
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,680
positive because this minus cancels this

226
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,440
minus this minus

227
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
this minus is squared. So this minus

228
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,720
cancels this minus

229
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,120
this minus is cubed but there are two

230
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,320
minuses here so that one cancels this

231
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,320
minus etc. So we can ignore the minus

232
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,320
signs.

233
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,480
Okay. So I would like to take the term

234
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,199
for

235
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,199
x= 3.

236
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Well, I want to claim that that is

237
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:32,360
7 halves * 5 halves * three halves.

238
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
um

239
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,480
times

240
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,759
12 * 12

241
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,759
actually this is a minus one/2 divided

242
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,360
by

243
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,279
okay

244
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,279
so I guess that is five factorial

245
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,519
um

246
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,519
there's a four to the 4th Here

247
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,760
there's a two here and a two

248
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,760
to the

249
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,760
two to the 4th here. Well, no.

250
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Um,

251
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,880
well,

252
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,880
I hope I haven't forgotten any terms.

253
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,880
So,

254
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:43,280
okay. So, what is this?

255
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:52,000
Top is 7 * 5 * 3 /

256
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:54,867
2 5th * 2 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 and there's a

257
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,887
4 to the 4th up here.

258
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,887
[clears throat]

259
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
So

260
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,039
there are five, six, seven twos on the

261
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,640
bottom and eight twos on the top. So

262
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,679
that's 2 to the 8th over 2 to the 7th

263
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,240
and the 3 and the five cancel out and

264
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,960
you get 7

265
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,000
equals 14.

266
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,640
So we did this right

267
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and I want to claim just by

268
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:36,840
well just by generalization

269
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,840
that this is um going to be

270
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,559
um 2 n -1

271
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:48,480
c subn = 2 n -1 double factorial. So

272
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,919
double factorial means 2 n -1 2 n - 3 2

273
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:57,520
n - 5 all the way down to 1. So this is

274
00:18:51,919 --> 00:19:03,240
7 double factorial 7 * 5 * 3 * 1

275
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,240
4 to the n + 1

276
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:14,520
/ 2 * 2 n + 1 times

277
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,160
um

278
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,440
should be n + one factorial.

279
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:45,799
And wait, this is x= 4, not x= 3.

280
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,799
And this is so this is

281
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,480
Yeah. 4 4th

282
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,480
* x cubed

283
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,240
over 2 * 5 factorial. So this is indeed

284
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,400
n +1 factorial

285
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,080
and this is

286
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:11,840
two well there's 2 to the n + one twos

287
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:17,059
here and another two and we have

288
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,059
n + one factorial. [clears throat]

289
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:35,200
Okay.

290
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:38,480
So now we need to manipulate this into

291
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:43,919
some kind of

292
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:46,799
oh I should say x to the n here

293
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,880
we need to manipulate this into a better

294
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:55,840
form and the way we do that is we say 2

295
00:20:50,880 --> 00:21:00,240
k - 1 factorial is equal to 2

296
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:09,159
k factorial over

297
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:09,159
2k * 2k - 2 all the way down to 2k - 4.

298
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,799
So this is just the odd.

299
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,080
So this is this is the odd terms between

300
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,880
1 and 2k minus one. So this is all the

301
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,520
terms between 1 and 2k and we divide by

302
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,520
the even terms and we get the odd terms.

303
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:39,960
But this is just 2k factorial over k

304
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,960
factorial * 2 the k.

305
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,280
So that says that c subn is equal to

306
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,919
2 n factorial

307
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,880
divided by n factorial.

308
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,919
And over here we have an n + one

309
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,919
factorial.

310
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,919
Okay,

311
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,919
there's a 4 to the n + one on top

312
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,559
and

313
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,559
there are

314
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,159
2

315
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:35,520
* 2 n + 1 * 2 to the n on the bottom.

316
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,919
This 2 the n comes from this one. This 2

317
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,240
the n + one comes from that guy and the

318
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,799
two comes from

319
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,799
this 2x

320
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,120
and everything cancels out except all

321
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,240
the factors of two cancel out and we're

322
00:22:49,120 --> 00:23:01,039
left with 2 n factorial over n factorial

323
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:04,559
n + 1 factorial which is 1 / n + 1

324
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,159
2 n choose n

325
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,600
which you should recognize as the

326
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,600
formula for Catalan numbers. Yes.

327
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,360
>> How do you get?

328
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,640
Oh

329
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,679
well

330
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,320
the catalog numbers are 1 one two 514

331
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,080
and this is just

332
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,000
summation

333
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,159
c subn x to the n is a generating

334
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,720
function

335
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:42,200
and that's 1 + x + 2x^2

336
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,200
+ 5 x 4th 5 x cubed

337
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,600
+ 14 x 4th

338
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,600
dot.

339
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
So the expansion

340
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,840
here are the first few terms of the

341
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,840
expansion. The first term you have a

342
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,039
minus 4x and a minus1 over 2x because

343
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,640
the minus1 over 2x sign minus one over

344
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:13,520
2x term here comes from this minus sign.

345
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:17,679
The second term you have 12 * - 12

346
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,400
/ 2 factorial * -4x^2.

347
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,919
So this is positive. This is minus and

348
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:30,159
this is minus. The third term you have

349
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:31,919
this minus this minus and this minus and

350
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
multiplying them all together you get a

351
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,640
minus sign and it cancels out this minus

352
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,200
sign. So it's positive. So all the terms

353
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,360
are positive

354
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,480
and

355
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,480
really um

356
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:54,440
[clears throat]

357
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,440
yeah. So um

358
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:57,402
[clears throat]

359
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,000
so now that we know all the terms are

360
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,960
positive, we can ignore the minus sign

361
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,760
on this. although

362
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,760
you're multiplying by.

363
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Yeah.

364
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Okay.

365
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,720
So this is

366
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,960
another way of getting the formula for

367
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,960
C subn.

368
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,840
And I want to say that there's a

369
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,840
completely different way of deriving the

370
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,720
this

371
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,279
formula for the Catalan number. we

372
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,840
derive this equation in a completely

373
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,240
different way. And I figured I might as

374
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,360
well show it because

375
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,120
well because it illustrates uh you know

376
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,440
it illustrates a neat technique of um

377
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,279
generating functions that I had some

378
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,840
questions about in my office hours

379
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,080
yesterday. So generating function

380
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,080
Catalina numbers also correspond to dick

381
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,080
paths.

382
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Okay.

383
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,799
So a dick path can be broken

384
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,799
into a sequence of

385
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,919
paths

386
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,360
with

387
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,360
plus or minus one steps.

388
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,360
And

389
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,360
which touch zero only at their end

390
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,360
points.

391
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,919
So

392
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
let's do it for this

393
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,799
dick path.

394
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,799
The first dick path is the sky. The

395
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:57,679
second one is the sky.

396
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,039
One, two. The third one is the sky. And

397
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,440
the fourth one will be the sky.

398
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,480
So it's pretty clear that every dick

399
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,039
path can be broken into a sequence of

400
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,039
this kind of paths.

401
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:21,720
So

402
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,720
if d of x is the generating function

403
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,000
for paths

404
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,840
that

405
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,559
well for paths that only touch zero at

406
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,559
their own points

407
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Well,

408
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,919
we can use the theorem about sequences

409
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,840
generating functions from sequences.

410
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,559
this to get the generating function for

411
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:13,159
cataline numbers or generating function

412
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,159
for dick paths. So

413
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:32,440
C of X is equal to

414
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,440
1 / 1 - D of X, right?

415
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,480
but

416
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,480
d of x.

417
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,799
Well, um,

418
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:59,240
you have

419
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,240
everything in D of X looks like

420
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,919
this

421
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,919
where this is a dick tap

422
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,480
and you have an up step on the left and

423
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,640
a right step down step on the right.

424
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,000
So every

425
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,720
one of this kind of paths it just comes

426
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,559
from a dick path where you add two steps

427
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,600
to it.

428
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:36,279
So this says that

429
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,279
d of x is equal to x * c of x

430
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,559
because x

431
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:49,520
to the k was twi in this

432
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:52,720
um generating function x to the k was k

433
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:57,760
was twice the number of steps in a dick

434
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:01,120
path. And to get the

435
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:06,080
raised dick paths, you add two steps to

436
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,480
a dick path. So you get x * c of x. So

437
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:14,631
we have c of x

438
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,286
= 1 / 1 - x c of x.

439
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:17,306
[cough]

440
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:17,306
[clears throat]

441
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,720
And you should be able to multiply this

442
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,880
equation

443
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,799
on

444
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,679
both sides

445
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,679
to get um

446
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,559
so we have c of x

447
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:45,360
- x c of x^2

448
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:48,720
- 1 = 0 which is the same equation we

449
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,720
had earlier.

450
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:54,320
>> [clears throat]

451
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,240
>> and you get the same quadratic equation

452
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,240
and you can do everything exactly the

453
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,240
same way as we did earlier.

454
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Yeah.

455
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:16,480
>> Right. Okay. So,

456
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:18,640
[clears throat] so D of X are paths that

457
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,399
start with an upstep, end with a down

458
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,399
step, and never go below one.

459
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,080
Okay. Um,

460
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:54,480
this equals some n= 0 to infinity

461
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,679
d subn x to the n.

462
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,679
DN paths

463
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,279
of length

464
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,760
2N

465
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,760
which start

466
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,760
start

467
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,559
up

468
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:19,360
end with a down step and never

469
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,703
go below

470
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,723
one.

471
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:23,723
[clears throat]

472
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:33,320
So here we have

473
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,320
let's call this zero call this one

474
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:40,320
and we have a path up here that never

475
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:44,000
goes below one

476
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:49,320
until the last step

477
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,320
in which case it goes down to zero.

478
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,679
Now if you take off the last step and

479
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,919
the first step here

480
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,919
you get

481
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,960
this thing is a dick

482
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,960
path.

483
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:21,520
So d subn is equal to the number of dick

484
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:26,560
p of these raised dicks paths is equal

485
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:29,280
to c subn minus one because we have

486
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,760
subtracted

487
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,119
two edges from

488
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:39,399
d subn to get

489
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,399
a thick path.

490
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,920
So, d of x

491
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,280
equals sum

492
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,680
d subn

493
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,280
x to the n

494
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,839
is equal to sum

495
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:16,440
c subn.

496
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,440
x I'm sorry c n minus one x to the n

497
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,400
is equal to some

498
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,240
oh gosh

499
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:30,240
is equal to sum

500
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,040
I'm going to claim this is c sub nus1

501
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,599
x to the nus1

502
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,599
times x

503
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,839
And maybe we should

504
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,839
well

505
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,320
there's no no

506
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,599
d paths of length

507
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,040
zero. The shortest one is of length two.

508
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:09,040
So this summation starts at n equals 1.

509
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,440
And we can just say n = 1 to infinity.

510
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,480
And this is

511
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,640
n = 1 to infinity.

512
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,560
And you can recognize this as just equal

513
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,880
the generating function for catal

514
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,880
numbers which is x c of x.

515
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,000
Okay. So I said I would hold a question

516
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,960
and answer session in the last um I

517
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,760
guess 30 minutes of this

518
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:45,000
um question. So is there anything that

519
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,000
people want to um you have a question?

520
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,160
>> Oh okay.

521
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:01,040
Well, I mean that just comes from

522
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,800
plugging this equation into this

523
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,400
equation.

524
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,200
How did we get?

525
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,839
>> We got the top equation because of this

526
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,680
theorem about sequences for generic

527
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,839
functions

528
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,480
which

529
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,760
um

530
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,280
maybe you

531
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,720
maybe you used on your homework

532
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,720
yesterday. Although um

533
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,960
so let's go over this theorem about

534
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,960
sequences.

535
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,200
Okay. So suppose a generating function

536
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,680
suppose

537
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,680
a generating function

538
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,839
functions

539
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,839
counts

540
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,839
let's call them objects

541
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,359
there are a n object objects

542
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,359
of

543
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,560
size

544
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:36,640
and or size might be the length of a

545
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,359
dick path or or I guess size might be

546
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,079
half the length of a dick path but it

547
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,599
could be anything else anyway

548
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,599
can think of this as an abstract

549
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,599
quantity.

550
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,880
So we ask how many

551
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,880
sequences are there

552
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,680
are there

553
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,680
of

554
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,400
let's call these objects alpha of

555
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
objects

556
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:19,920
alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 through alpha

557
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,839
Okay.

558
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,359
And these sequences can be of any

559
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,680
length.

560
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,680
And the size of a sequence

561
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:39,240
is equal to sum i = 1 through k alpha

562
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,240
subi

563
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,359
I'm sorry is equal to the size of the

564
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,359
sum of the sizes of these objects.

565
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Then

566
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,720
the generating function for the

567
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,720
sequences

568
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,440
is 1 / 1 minus the generic function for

569
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,440
the objects.

570
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,400
And I should write down the generating

571
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,800
functions for the objects.

572
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,359
A of x=

573
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,200
some n=

574
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,520
I guess 1 to infinity alpha subn x to

575
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,359
the n

576
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,160
because you're really not allowed to

577
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,200
have objects of size zero

578
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,359
in this theorem because then there would

579
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,960
be an infinite number of sequences

580
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,320
of size k which doesn't make sense

581
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,320
because if you could add ar ar ar ar ar

582
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,400
ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar

583
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,960
ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar

584
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,880
ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar arbitrarily

585
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,440
many objects of size zero.

586
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,079
You can get arbitrary many objects of

587
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,480
any finite size or any arbitrary many

588
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:13,319
sequences of any finite size and that

589
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,319
you know that gives you infinities.

590
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,079
Okay. So how does this work for dick

591
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,079
paths?

592
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,079
Well,

593
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,319
any dick path

594
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:34,079
is just a sequence of rays dick paths.

595
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,760
So you have a ray. So here

596
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:41,920
actually here the dick path is the empty

597
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:46,240
path. So the rays dick path has length

598
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:50,720
two and size one. Here the dick path is

599
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,960
up down up up down which has size two

600
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,440
and the raised dick path has size one

601
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,760
more up down up down down.

602
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,200
And here the dick path is up down the

603
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,079
raised dick path has size two. And here

604
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,160
you know we have dick path of length of

605
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,560
size three. So the raised dick path has

606
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,640
size four.

607
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,000
And now

608
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:22,000
what we do is we use the formula for the

609
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,040
number of

610
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,440
you know we say a dick path was

611
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:34,960
just a sequence of raised dick paths. So

612
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:38,000
that means c of x = 1 over 1 - d of x.

613
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,240
But raised dick paths

614
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,079
are just

615
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,599
dick paths with two extra edges. So d of

616
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:53,560
x = x * c of x

617
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,560
and you get c of x = 1 over 1 - x c ofx.

618
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,119
Um there I believe there was a

619
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,280
generating function problem on the

620
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,760
homework with tiling things of length

621
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,800
three with

622
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,960
2x one tiles and you can use the theorem

623
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,079
about generating functions for sequences

624
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,240
to solve that one too.

625
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,000
Okay. Well, I have I have prepared

626
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,839
another problem which is very similar to

627
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,240
that problem. So why don't I present the

628
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,240
similar problem?

629
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,079
Okay.

630
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,680
Oh, and okay. And I actually think that

631
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,680
I will

632
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,680
um

633
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,520
How many

634
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,520
tilings

635
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,760
of a 2x n

636
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,119
strip

637
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,200
with two shapes of tiles which you can

638
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,400
rotate

639
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:42,440
and reflect if you want.

640
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,440
So these are the two shapes.

641
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,359
Use the sequence theorem for generating

642
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,359
functions.

643
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,640
And um

644
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,319
let

645
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,319
a of

646
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,359
let a

647
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,520
let's use a lowercase a a sub

648
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,560
n be Number

649
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,560
of Kylings

650
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,119
of 2 by N strip

651
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,680
with no which cannot be separated and

652
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,680
two

653
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,880
cannot

654
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,760
be separated.

655
00:45:51,839 --> 00:46:01,720
into

656
00:45:53,359 --> 00:46:01,720
a 2 by k and 2 by n minus k strip.

657
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,520
So in some sense this is the number of I

658
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,560
don't know fundamental tilings of a 2x

659
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,440
strip which cannot be cannot be

660
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,839
assembled out of other tilings.

661
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:25,720
Okay, let's let's think let's try to um

662
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,720
figure out what these numbers are.

663
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:43,680
So the smallest tiling

664
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,560
is clearly this

665
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,400
and this is

666
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,640
um

667
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,800
so this is a sub3 because there are

668
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,960
three

669
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,720
you know this has length three and there

670
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,079
are two of these tilings because you can

671
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:04,200
reflect it along a horizontal line. So a

672
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,200
sub3 = 2.

673
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:12,720
a sub4 equals zero. I want to say there

674
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,960
are no ways to tile a 2x4 strip with

675
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,960
those tiles.

676
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,640
A sub5 equals 2

677
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,640
because

678
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,720
A sub6 equals zero.

679
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,560
So let's call the number of tilings.

680
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:54,680
Let B subn be number of tilings.

681
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,359
So B subn

682
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:06,160
is going to be 2 0 2. But I'm going to

683
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,960
claim that there is a tiling

684
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:14,680
of B subn, but it's not a elementary

685
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,680
tiling because it's made up of two um

686
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,560
subtitles.

687
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,880
Um

688
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,880
I'm doing a bad job of drawing it.

689
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,599
I want to claim that there are four of

690
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,240
these

691
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,440
because you could reflect the first half

692
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:39,520
or you could reflect the second half.

693
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:42,319
And that's just this squared because you

694
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,640
take two A3s

695
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:47,839
and put them next to each other. And if

696
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,040
there are two tilings of length three,

697
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:54,040
this gives you four tilings of length

698
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,040
six.

699
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:05,240
A7 = 2

700
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,240
and um

701
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:17,680
B subn is a number of tilings where you

702
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,880
don't require that they're fundamental

703
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,160
tiling. So B subn can be made up of the

704
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,520
B's can be made up of two tilings

705
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,960
which are just stuck next to each other.

706
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:35,599
Whereas the A's we want to require that

707
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,280
there are no vertical you cannot find a

708
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,079
vertical line that splits this tiling

709
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,400
into two.

710
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,880
>> So the vertical line is defined by the

711
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,119
separated into K nus K.

712
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,119
>> That's right.

713
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,880
So um

714
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:55,359
and I want to claim that

715
00:49:52,880 --> 00:50:05,200
a sub8

716
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:08,200
= a5 * a3 + a3 * a5 is equal to

717
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,200
8

718
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,359
because you can take this tile and put

719
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,440
it next to this tile

720
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,040
or you take take this tile and put it

721
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,400
before this tile. Or you can take this

722
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,400
tile and put it before that tile.

723
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:27,839
[clears throat]

724
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,640
So thinking about this, if you don't

725
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,720
want any vertical lines, the only way to

726
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,880
get an A

727
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,960
tile is

728
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,559
to start

729
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,440
with um

730
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,520
an L and put all these Z tiles next to

731
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,480
it.

732
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,240
and then end it with an L.

733
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,400
So,

734
00:50:50,240 --> 00:51:00,280
a

735
00:50:52,400 --> 00:51:00,280
sub 2 K + 1 is equal to two. So, the odd

736
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,160
the odd A's are

737
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,960
there are two ways of

738
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,200
giving a fundamental tile for odd

739
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:16,240
numbers and zero for even numbers. So

740
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,880
that means a of x

741
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,880
is equal to

742
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,680
um

743
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,680
summation

744
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:32,160
k = 1 0

745
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:38,400
k = 1 through infinity

746
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:44,440
x to the 2k + 1 * 2

747
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,440
= x cub 1 / 1 - x^2.

748
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Okay.

749
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,800
So now let's compute this generating

750
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,319
function.

751
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:05,480
B of X is equal to

752
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,480
1 / X cub

753
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,640
1 / 1 - x^2.

754
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Okay.

755
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,359
1 -

756
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:39,520
Oh, wait. I forgot. There's a two here.

757
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:41,839
So 1 - twice that

758
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,280
is equal to

759
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:50,559
okay we can multiply 1 - x^2 on the top

760
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:55,960
and bottom and we get 1 - x^2 over 1 -

761
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,960
x^2 - 2x cubed.

762
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,760
Okay,

763
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:11,559
so we have a generating function for=

764
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,559
sum b subn x to the n.

765
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,520
Okay, so we have a generating function

766
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,440
for b.

767
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,880
Now

768
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:25,400
I want to say that you can read off a

769
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,400
recurrence from a generating function.

770
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,960
Sorry, it's kind of a minor thing. Is

771
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,960
that B

772
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,559
of the top right corner of this?

773
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,720
>> Oh, yeah. Right.

774
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:53,920
B

775
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,319
um 8 equals 8.

776
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,559
Thank you.

777
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,680
>> So the it's not A8.

778
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:04,319
>> A8 equals zero.

779
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:07,040
Okay. Yeah. So, this is B8= A5 * A3 plus

780
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:12,119
A3 * A5.

781
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,119
I'm sorry about that. Yeah.

782
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,240
Okay. So, we have um

783
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,160
>> a question. What did you do to get to

784
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,480
simplify for the ax

785
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,400
thing before you do the um sequence

786
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,920
theorem?

787
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:33,599
>> Okay. Well, it's just the sum twice

788
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,692
times the sum of x to all odd numbers.

789
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,040
And

790
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:39,040
[clears throat]

791
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,880
um

792
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:46,800
okay, maybe I should do this more

793
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:51,280
slowly. This is x cubed

794
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,800
time sum 2 x

795
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,319
to the 2n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

796
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,319
n n n n n = 0 through infinity

797
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,359
because the smallest one of these is x

798
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:06,160
cubed. So you can multiply by that and

799
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:09,520
then you have all the even ones after

800
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:13,200
that. And now this

801
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,599
you should know the formula for a

802
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:22,079
geometric series

803
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:25,839
is equal to 2x cubed over 1 - x^2

804
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:30,119
because sum n= 0 to infinity of x to the

805
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,119
2n is 1 - x^2.

806
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,040
And actually that's very easy to see. Um

807
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:47,359
because

808
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:48,960
1 + x2 + x4 + x6 plus dot dot dot * 1 -

809
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,400
x^2

810
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:58,559
is equal to 1. And now we have a - x^2 +

811
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:01,119
x^2 - x 4 + x 4 - x 6 plus x 6. So all

812
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,640
the other terms cancel out.

813
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:07,640
So this is a formula for a geometric

814
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,640
series.

815
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:15,920
Okay. So

816
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:18,720
what did we have? We have yeah

817
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,319
I want to say that you can read off a

818
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,599
recurrence

819
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,599
from a generating function.

820
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,319
So suppose you have P of X over

821
00:56:31,629 --> 00:56:40,440
>> [clears throat]

822
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:40,440
>> um 1 - x^2 - x 2x cubed

823
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:49,160
p of x gives

824
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,160
initial conditions

825
00:56:51,200 --> 00:57:00,640
and 1 - x^2 - x 2x cub gives recurrence.

826
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:06,240
So

827
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:09,440
this recurrence says b subn is equal to

828
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:14,720
b subn minus 2

829
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:17,720
+ 2 b sub nus 3.

830
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,720
So

831
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,480
um I guess we can

832
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,480
explain this.

833
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,559
So

834
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:47,920
summation b sub i x to the i is equal to

835
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,440
p of x

836
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:58,200
over 1 - x^2 - x cubed.

837
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,200
So what this means is that

838
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,599
um

839
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,680
I want to multiply both sides here. So

840
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,680
we're going to get b subn x to the n

841
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,680
minus

842
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:33,280
B n - 2 x nus 2

843
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:37,400
* x^2.

844
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,400
Oh, wait. This had a two

845
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,400
minus

846
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:53,000
b nus 3

847
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:53,000
x to the nus 3 and um

848
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:03,000
and there's a two here

849
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
equals

850
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:12,920
x to the n term

851
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,920
of p of x.

852
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:20,000
So multiplying just this by both sides

853
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,520
and pulling out the

854
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,079
x to the n term

855
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,240
oh * x cubed

856
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,319
gives you

857
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:35,119
that.

858
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:40,319
So this says that bn - bn minus 2 - bn

859
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:42,400
minus 3 equals zero unless

860
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:45,119
there's an x to the n term and p of x

861
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,359
and p of x is a

862
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,160
polomial with only a finite number of

863
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:54,960
terms. So after this finite number of

864
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:57,280
terms you have this recurrence.

865
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,280
So bn is

866
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,280
bn

867
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,280
Okay,

868
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,799
let's go back

869
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,799
here.

870
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:38,599
So we have b subn = b n - 2 + 2 b nus 3

871
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:48,000
b 0 = 1 b3 =

872
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,880
2

873
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,400
b5 = 2

874
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,400
b6 = 4

875
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:01,480
B7

876
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,480
= 2

877
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,119
B8

878
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,200
= 8 etc.

879
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:15,200
So let's see if this works.

880
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:20,000
So

881
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:24,559
B2 should be equal to B 0 +

882
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:28,400
2 B minus one. But B2 is zero and not B

883
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,400
not one. But that is because

884
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,200
we had

885
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,200
the um

886
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:49,520
v of x = 1 - x^2 over 1 -

887
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:55,280
x^2 - 2x cubed.

888
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:58,920
That's because this term was minus one

889
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,920
which says that

890
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,200
B2

891
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:08,799
B2 equals

892
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:12,079
B 0 minus one when you work it all out.

893
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:17,040
But after after the second term that

894
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:19,280
recurrence works great. B3 is equal to

895
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:23,000
2 B 0.

896
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,000
B4 equals

897
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:31,839
2 B2 + I mean B2 + 3 B1. B5

898
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,440
is

899
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:37,599
B3.

900
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:40,960
B6 is 2 B3.

901
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,680
B7 is

902
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,960
B5. B5.

903
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,839
B8 is

904
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:54,839
2 B6

905
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:54,839
plus B8 is

906
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:04,559
yeah B8 is B6 plus 2 B3 which is 8

907
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,680
etc.

908
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:10,400
So you can just read off

909
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,359
the recurrence from the bottom of the

910
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,000
generating function and the top

911
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:18,720
numerator tells you

912
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,720
um what the initial conditions

913
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,720
are.

914
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,640
Okay, any other questions?

915
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,799
Okay, I I also could say that you could

916
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,680
have figured this out this recurrence

917
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:48,000
out

918
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:50,000
without using generating functions

919
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,440
because

920
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,440
basically if you have a

921
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,319
Oh, wait.

922
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,440
uh tiling that looks like this.

923
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,720
There are two ways to extend it. You can

924
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,359
um

925
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,520
extend it. Use the same tiling in the

926
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,520
first part

927
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,960
and add one of these Z tiles

928
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:29,000
and add that

929
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,000
or you can extend it.

930
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,039
Okay. So this is

931
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:55,280
you know you've extended this by two. So

932
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,680
that gives you the formula BN minus 2.

933
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,680
Here you've extended this by three. But

934
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,079
there were two ways to do it because you

935
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,559
could have added this block or you could

936
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:08,880
have added this block reflected around

937
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:12,000
its ver its uh horizontal axis. So that

938
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:17,599
gives you two bn minus 3.

939
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:19,520
And you cannot extend the

940
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:24,160
empty tile

941
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:30,039
in the second way which explains why B2

942
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:30,039
is zero and not two

943
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,720
which explains why B2 is zero and not

944
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,720
one.

945
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:47,480
So you could have gotten this recurrence

946
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,480
without using generating functions.

947
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,559
Okay.

948
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,039
So

949
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,920
any other questions?

950
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,599
>> Yeah.

951
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:19,200
>> So like this problem intuitively is that

952
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:22,559
a n is like counting the components. So

953
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,440
bn is like a sequence of individual

954
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,640
components.

955
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:30,960
>> Exactly. BN is a sequence of these a n

956
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:37,319
components. So you get

957
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:37,319
um b of x = 1 over 1 - a of x.

958
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,240
>> Yes.

959
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,520
>> You go over how you got the bn

960
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,280
recurrence.

961
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,920
>> How I got the bn recurrence.

962
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,920
>> Oh

963
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,920
well.

964
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,680
So it's something I mean if you go

965
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,960
through our proof about how to construct

966
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,200
generating functions from recurrences

967
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,200
you know

968
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,880
if a genering function

969
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:26,520
has I guess summation

970
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:26,520
f subn x to the n equals Equals

971
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:34,599
P of X over

972
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,599
um

973
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,119
1

974
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,200
-

975
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:46,880
A1X - A2X^2

976
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:51,599
- A3 X cubed.

977
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:53,680
Actually this is more general than that.

978
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,599
P of X

979
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,000
gives

980
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,480
initial

981
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,240
conditions

982
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,559
and

983
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,559
we have

984
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:11,359
F subn =

985
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:19,279
A1 F nus1

986
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:19,279
+ A2 F NUS 2 plus A3 F sub NUS

987
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:40,640
EG. If

988
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:43,640
p of x = 1 + x 2x^2

989
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,640
then

990
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,239
I want to say f sub0

991
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:55,717
= 1

992
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:57,737
f sub1 = 0 and f sub2 =

993
01:08:55,717 --> 01:08:57,737
>> [clears throat]

994
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,319
>> or well actually that's not quite true

995
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:19,520
because um

996
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:23,600
I should probably use this as the

997
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:27,813
example. We have b of x = 1 - x^2 over 1

998
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,833
- x^2 - x cubed.

999
01:09:27,813 --> 01:09:29,833
[snorts]

1000
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:51,279
So

1001
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:58,040
1 / 1 - x^2 - 2x cubed

1002
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:58,040
would give you f0 = 1 and

1003
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:11,679
fn = f n - 2 + 2 fnus 3.

1004
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:13,360
So that would give you one zero one

1005
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,080
two

1006
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:21,199
and this is

1007
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:27,960
okay f4 would be f_sub_2 one again f5

1008
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:27,960
would be 2 + 2 which is 4.

1009
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:41,840
So this is 1 over 1 - x^2 - 2 x cubed.

1010
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:46,719
But we also have - x^2 over 1 - x^2 - 2x

1011
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:49,600
cubed. And this gives you basically this

1012
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:54,159
except you have to you know this will

1013
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,480
give you a minus one here and then zero

1014
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:59,760
minus one.

1015
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:02,760
Um the next one was min -2

1016
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,760
and

1017
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:13,760
-1 -4 and then when you add them up you

1018
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:20,600
actually get the sequence of f subi. So

1019
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:20,600
that gives you 1 0 0 2 0

1020
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:27,760
two

1021
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,760
um etc.

1022
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:36,960
And

1023
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:39,960
yeah, we have one 0 02 02

1024
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,960
etc.
