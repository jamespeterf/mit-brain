1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,480
okay so now you know about the clinical

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,200
samples and how the data derived from

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,679
those is structured so now let's get

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,880
into the really exciting part which is

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,120
what you're going to be working on what

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,040
are the three crunches you're going to

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,520
be kind of tackling here so let's start

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,480
with the first crunch so here we're

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,439
going to be asking you to predict gene

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,039
expression from tissue pathology images

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,760
so your training data is going to be

12
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,279
paired data where we give you the h&

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,399
image and the spatial transcript omix

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,239
data and we're going to provide you 460

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
genes that were measured in the spatial

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,719
transcriptomic data and then in the test

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,760
we're going to hold out patches of uh

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,840
tissue that are outlined here in a gray

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,120
box and in this patch we're going to

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,960
give you the h& image but we're going to

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,039
hide from you the spatial transcript

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,120
omix data and we're going to ask you to

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,480
take that h& image and predict this uh

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,440
transcript omic data for the cells that

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,399
are in that tissue patch so in this

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,920
cartoon here we have a through F and

27
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,119
we're going to ask you to predict the

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,759
expression of Gene 1 2 3 all the way to

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,439
Gene 460 and then we're going to see how

30
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,000
well you do because we actually know the

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,920
underlying ground truth because we've

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,360
carried out the spatial transcriptomics

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,960
experiment for this entire tissue so

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,360
again starting with the h& image can you

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,560
predict spatial transcriptomics data for

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,720
all the cells in this heldout tissue

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,360
patch so that's the first

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,439
crunch the second crunch we make things

39
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,000
more difficult for you and that we are

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,079
going to ask you to predict the gene

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,439
expression for genes that were never

42
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,000
measured by the spatial transcriptomics

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,880
experiment so we've chosen 20 genes that

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,960
were not measured by spatial

45
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,119
transcriptomics and we are going to ask

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,719
you to predict their expression so the

47
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,399
structure of this is pretty similar to

48
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,759
Crunch one and then we're going to

49
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,640
provide you with pair data and we're

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,439
providing you with the h& image and the

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,079
spatial transcriptomics data for 460

52
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,920
genes and we are going to hold out

53
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,880
tissue patches and from the h& image

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,200
we're going to ask you to predict the

55
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,080
held out spatial transcriptomics data

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,560
but in addition 20 genes they were never

57
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,599
measured by spatial

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,080
transcriptomics so you're not going to

59
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,879
just be predicting genes 1 through 460

60
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,519
but also genes 461 462 all the way to

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,680
480 and now you're asking well how would

62
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,640
I know anything about those 20 genes

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,319
this is where all our background about

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,280
single cell transcriptomics comes in we

65
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,599
are going to provide you with single

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,360
cell transcriptomic data from ulcerative

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,640
colitis patients and that data has all

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,319
20,000 genes measured so it has the 460

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,720
genes we provide you in spatial

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,000
transcriptomics it has the 20 genes that

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,800
we would like you to predict and it has

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,640
all other

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,000
19520 genes uh provided so can you use

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,400
the single cell transcriptomic data to

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,040
tell to tell us what are the uh gene

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,720
expression levels uh for those 20 gen

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,319
that we're really interested in so

78
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,360
that's crunch 2 it's really an out of

79
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,159
distribution problem because we're never

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,080
providing you spatial transcriptomics

81
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,840
data for those 20

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,480
genes okay so that's crunches one and

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,799
two and the final crunch is focused on

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,040
detecting cancer earlier so the focus is

85
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,920
on this really special uh aler of

86
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,720
colitis tissue section where there's

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,599
both a non-cancerous region and the

88
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,319
colon mucosa and this displasia region

89
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,319
and remember displasia is this sort of

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,519
abnormal growth of epithelial cells

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,920
that's precancerous and what we would

92
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,920
like is to find genes that differentiate

93
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,959
or that Mark the displasia region from

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,480
the non-cancerous region so what are

95
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,239
genes that are more highly expressed in

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,959
this displasia region compared to the

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,319
non-cancerous region and these are genes

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,720
that can maybe tell us what's going on

99
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,120
in these early cancer events so there

100
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,200
are many ways to go about doing this but

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,480
if you've done crunches one and two you

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
will have built models that can take the

103
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,000
AG

104
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,120
image and predict gene expression and so

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,760
one very reasonable way to proceed is to

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,640
take the h& image here and predict the

107
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,239
gene expression in the different regions

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,680
in the displasia region and the

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,280
non-cancerous region and so we can make

110
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,600
those gene expression predictions in the

111
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,600
non-cancerous regions here for cells

112
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,800
here and in the displasia region for

113
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,360
cells here and get all these predicted

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,759
gene expression vectors and one thing

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,880
I'll point out is that you actually have

116
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,360
zenium spatial transcriptomics data for

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,160
the non-cancerous region but we never

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,199
provide you any zenium spatial

119
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,800
transcriptomics data for the displasia

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,400
region so for the left half of this

121
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,000
tissue image you're really predicting

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,520
the genes beyond the 460 that have been

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,680
measured already by spatial

124
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,039
transcriptomics but on the right half

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,639
you're really predicting all 20,000

126
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,440
genes you do not have any spatial

127
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,800
transcriptomics data directly from that

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,720
uh piece of the tissue and again how do

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
you predict you know genes that you were

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,759
never you know given uh any information

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,400
about we are going to provide you with

132
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,880
single cell transcriptomic single cell

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,840
RNA sequencing data for uh displasia

134
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,080
regions so this is the data set that we

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,680
had introduced earlier and it's single

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
cell transcriptomics and it's going to

137
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,199
tell you what do epithelial cells with

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,280
dysplasia look like in terms of their

139
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,720
gene expression so you can use that

140
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,520
single cell transcriptomics data to help

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,000
with your predictions of what's going on

142
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,919
with the displasia regions and now once

143
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
you've kind of made these predictions of

144
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,039
you know gene expression in the

145
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,160
non-cancerous region and gene expression

146
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,199
in displasia regions it's a relatively

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
simple task to just compare the two and

148
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,039
say what genes are you know marking this

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
population of cells that in the

150
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,199
displasia region versus genes that are

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,880
marking the non-cancerous region so can

152
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,000
you look at these and say what are the

153
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,319
genes that distinguish these two regions

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,960
once you've made these predictions and

155
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,919
so this is a pretty ambitious crunch

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,800
it's pretty exciting and cool um and the

157
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,520
like one really really exciting part of

158
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,080
this too is that we're actually going to

159
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,800
experimentally test your predictions so

160
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,639
when you predict a gene that marks

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,319
dysplasia we're actually going to go in

162
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,599
and use that to design a new panel of

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,319
460 or 480 genes and we're going to use

164
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,720
that panel to measure a new piece of

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
colon tissue that has dysplasia and

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,440
we're going to see if the genes that you

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,759
predicted as marking displasia are

168
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,680
really being expressed in the dysplasia

169
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,639
region compared to the non-cancerous

170
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,720
region and so this is really an ultimate

171
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,240
test we're taking your predictions and

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,400
applying them to a piece of tissue that

173
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,560
we haven't measured before so this is a

174
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,880
really exciting opportunity you know

175
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,280
most machine learning competitions uh

176
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,840
there's not really an experiment

177
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,840
associated with there's not really you

178
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,000
know something new that you're really

179
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,400
doing and here we actually have a chance

180
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,880
to really go into patient specimens and

181
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,800
see if we can really get better at

182
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,199
predicting uh cancer in these tissue

183
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,840
