part of the MIT startup

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,399
exchange the startup exchange was

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,160
created within MIT corporate relations

21
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,120
to support MIT connected startups as

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,239
they grow and address Global challenges

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
MIT startup exchange Fosters these

24
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,480
collaborations of Partnerships between

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,720
startups and Industry such as ILP

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,439
members and throughout the MIT

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,320
Innovation

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,320
ecosystem MIT startup exchange it

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,479
focuses on startups with a strong and

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,119
eligible connection to the Institute and

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,159
this connection could be through the

32
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,360
founding team the technology as well as

33
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,479
their affiliation to our MIT peers who

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,360
vet and support them such as start. Nano

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,159
the engine or Cale connect

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,600
plus today we have a network of about

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
1,000 startups virtually working in any

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,360
sector and this is possible because they

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,200
come out of any of the five schools in

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,520
one college some are created during NBAs

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,159
or other courses and many startups

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,799
graduate from other entrepreneurial

43
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,640
resources and there are or are over 80

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,840
here on MIT campus you can find most of

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,439
these resources at orbit. mit.edu that

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,560
our colleagues from The Martin trust

47
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,520
center created but another key

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,000
distinction of the MIT startup exchange

49
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,920
is that we typically start working with

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,960
startups when they have a technology or

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
a product that is ready to be tested or

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,080
used in a real

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
environment everything we do here at

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
startup exchange is to expose and

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,160
connect startups to Industry through a

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,080
highly curated approach so this includes

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,840
launching calls for startups to respond

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,400
to corporate challenges or New Market

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,560
opportunities and R&D Partnerships it's

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,080
one-on-one meetings and events such as

61
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,360
demo days that are virtual startup

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,200
lightning talks like today and Pitch

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,160
sessions and then the learning

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,840
opportunities are provided at workshops

65
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,280
that we co-organize with our MIT peers

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,920
the goal of all of these activities is

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,879
to ultimately help startups validate

68
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,159
pivot or scale acquire customers expand

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,000
and corporates to learn to improve the

70
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,640
internal processes to expand their

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,920
portfolio or to create new business

72
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,040
opportunities so right here this is just

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,480
a small sample of the success cases

74
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,480
we've had to date that include proofs of

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,040
concept uh Pilots joint development

76
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,200
acquis positions uh this could be you

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,239
