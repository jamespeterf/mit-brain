1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,799
some fantastic presentations have

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,439
already uh been put in front of you

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,440
today you've seen some really insightful

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:12,799
kind of uh work with AI and how it's

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,799
kind of evolving um it's now 4:00 in the

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,080
afternoon you're probably a little bit

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,560
tired um I'm going to try and keep you

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,320
awake uh for that last kind of stint I

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,400
know you're probably thinking to

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,480
yourself how am I getting home uh what's

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,960
for dinner what uh what's in the fridge

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,840
um but I mean I couple of little things

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,399
I know I have a weird accent I uh I come

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,239
from I'm I'm Irish by by birth and I

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,239
know I speak at a million miles an hour

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,520
and I know with this particular topic I

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,559
get very very enthusiastic so please

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,760
forgive my uh somewhat some somewhat uh

19
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,280
immature excitement as I go through this

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,160
when I get very excited about certain

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,520
elements of the conversation but

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,760
hopefully what I'm going to do is I'm

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,680
going to Showcase some really really

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,559
interesting ideas that can make you

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,199
think about where the future is headed

26
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,359
how AI is shaping real estate

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,879
specifically and how AI is supercharging

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
this incredible concept that is digital

29
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,400
twin and you know we're going to look at

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
some of kind of a number of different

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
aspects from that and hopefully what I'm

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,360
going to do is I'm going to kind of get

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,960
you on my side to to get you thinking

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,759
about how this potentially is one of the

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,280
most important Concepts in the in the

36
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,400
Realms of real estate going forward

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
digital twin technology itself is really

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,240
starting to revolutionize and has been

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,000
revolutionizing a number of Industries

40
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,759
for for quite some time now even

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,920
including real estate by really

42
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,159
providing uh virtual replicas

43
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,520
essentially of physical assets we're

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,640
going to kind of go through that in the

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,200
in the next few minutes and these

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,920
digital models are really what they're

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
doing is they're integrating real-time

48
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,240
data and historical data to really kind

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,119
of reflect that the physical counter H

50
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,960
kind of components within a specific

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,960
system and hopefully this presentation

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,680
what we're going to do is we're really

53
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,880
going to outline how the future of

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,880
digital TW digital twin technology is

55
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,759
really going to impact specifically the

56
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,240
the real estate sector so just to begin

57
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,200
with just introduce myself my name is

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,399
James Scott I wear a number of different

59
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,240
hats here at MIT um I was research

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,640
scientist I'm direct I mean I really

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,439
helped facilitate a number of the

62
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,679
industry relations over at the center

63
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,720
for Real Estate now and on top of that I

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,720
also am the director of the real estate

65
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,879
transformation lab what that is kind of

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,040
quite simply is what we try to do is

67
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,760
take the 40 now years of Real Estate

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,840
research and understanding that has

69
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,360
taken place within the center with mit's

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
technological prowess and understanding

71
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,879
um to merge that bring them together and

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,440
create a research platform that can

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,319
really start to understand this

74
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
digitization that's taking place across

75
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,680
the built environment and we do that in

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
a number of different facets with a

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,120
number of different research verticals

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,519
but primarily what we're always doing

79
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,040
above everything else is always trying

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,000
to understand what are the newest

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,680
products processes and technologies that

82
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,800
can really make a difference and so

83
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,920
that's kind of really I as as my wife

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
continues to tell me when am I going to

85
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
get a real job because it's one of the

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,879
most fun things anyone can actually

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
really get to do as

88
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,000
well um so over the course of this

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,239
conversation we're going to look at what

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,480
a digital twin is I'm going to assume

91
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,920
that numerous people know what it is

92
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,159
within the room but we're going to bring

93
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,440
it down we're going to start at the

94
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,239
start for everybody we're going to

95
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,959
quickly kind of De delve through that

96
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,640
figure out what it is the concept itself

97
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
understand the kind of the

98
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,360
classification system examples of what

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,000
it exists out there in the real world

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,080
and then finally its applications to

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,799
real estate and how AI is really driving

102
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,519
that forward over the course of the next

103
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,799
few

104
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,840
years so what is a digital twin these

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,200
are kind of two um I remember when I

106
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,120
went back researching this number of

107
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,519
years ago uh I think I stopped at about

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,439
37 different uh specific definitions of

109
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,920
Digit Twi there is no specific

110
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,319
definition out there these were just two

111
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
that I kind of enjoyed when I was

112
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,760
putting this together um a virtual

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,280
representation of a real world entity or

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,680
IBM how they classify it it's a digital

115
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,439
twin is a virtual representation of an

116
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,239
object or system that spans its life

117
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,360
cycle really great kind of definitions

118
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,040
and then but there's literally hundreds

119
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,040
of them out there but really all it

120
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,319
simply is is a dynamic ual

121
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,480
representation of any real world system

122
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,640
out there that utilizes now this is the

123
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,360
really important part real time and

124
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
historical data and so often times when

125
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
I ask in class when I ask them at the

126
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,159
start of what's a digital twin I usually

127
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,280
get the same three answers within about

128
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,160
12 seconds

129
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,720
Bim building management system

130
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
matterport they're not wrong but they're

131
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,919
just they're not necessarily right

132
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,600
either the difference between what a

133
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,240
really a digital twin is compared to all

134
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,639
of those other things is that the data

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,440
that's fed into it is live all right

136
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
like a matterport situation or a Bim

137
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,639
situation the data is static it stays

138
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,520
there and while you might see animations

139
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
taking place within that ultimately the

140
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,039
data doesn't actually move the

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
difference with a digital twin is that

142
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,600
that there is a live feed of data into

143
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,000
it at all times giving you two elements

144
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,720
a upto-date understanding as as of this

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,840
moment in time of what's taking place

146
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,919
within that system but most most

147
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,240
importantly and probably of the most

148
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,400
value is that it allows for forecasting

149
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,320
and scenario modeling within that system

150
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,280
as well and that's the real value part

151
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,360
of all within any all of this um there's

152
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,960
there's numerous different ways that

153
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,680
people kind of portray this in numerous

154
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,440
different systems with think collecting

155
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,880
the data generating the data and then

156
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,919
simulating it in through different

157
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,600
phases I actually bring it down to all

158
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,840
like I mean while we showed earlier

159
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,560
maybe 10 this is six I bring it down to

160
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,400
with real estate I often bring it down

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
to three simple phases all right there

162
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
is the data there is the representation

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,120
or the imagery that kind of takes place

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,400
within that and then from that what you

165
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,800
have is the analysis that's taking place

166
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,319
over here in the kind of the in the

167
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,000
third quadrant or the third the third

168
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,360
component of a triangle as

169
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,400
well uh digital twin Is Not A New

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,680
Concept and by the way again I'm hearing

171
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,240
my voice move quite fast here so if

172
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,880
please forgive how the speed at which I

173
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,759
want to try and get through all of this

174
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,600
but it's not necessarily new all right

175
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,800
the concept itself was really developed

176
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,960
back in the 60s with NASA all right they

177
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,880
started using the this basic twinning

178
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,240
concept to create physically duplicated

179
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,160
systems on Earth when they were running

180
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
missions in space right because

181
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,919
obviously they needed to run scenario

182
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,919
testing on the shuttle when it was in

183
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,120
orbit and they couldn't do it when it

184
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,680
was in orbit and then from that the term

185
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,199
digital twin itself was really first

186
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,919
mentioned in 1991 by David glenner in

187
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,280
his book mirror world and then from that

188
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,120
what you had I think about 2002 you had

189
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Michael Greaves over in Michigan and he

190
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,120
formally formally introduced the concept

191
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,639
of digital twin in the context of

192
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,599
product lifestyle management and his

193
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,360
work has really laid the foundation for

194
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,599
modern understanding of digital twins

195
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,960
out there in the manufacturing world as

196
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,440
well um the adoption of digital twin

197
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,039
really started to gain momentum though

198
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,400
in the last we'll say 10 15 years and

199
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,080
what drove that was of course the

200
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,280
advancement in AI capabilities the

201
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,240
advancement in data computational

202
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,240
computational power and of course the

203
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,560
proliferation of that wonderful fabulous

204
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,800
thing called the internet of things and

205
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,120
then really what happened we had that we

206
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,000
had a number of different people over

207
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,919
the the last 10 years like John Vickers

208
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,919
at NASA who really popularized the term

209
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,840
digital twin and the technology began to

210
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,840
really be recognized as a strategic

211
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,520
Trend across a number of different

212
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,560
Industries just a couple of quick

213
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,360
examples in the real world Rolls-Royce

214
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,240
intelligent engine has been around since

215
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,240
2018 this service utilizes digital twin

216
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,240
of a motor engine and performance of of

217
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,440
flight engines and what it has done it

218
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,240
has facilitated an improvement of the

219
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,520
lifespan of a flight engine by 1.5 times

220
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,759
of course we can't go anywhere these

221
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,319
days without talking about Nvidia and

222
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,479
digital twins of their factories have

223
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,080
allowed

224
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,360
manufacturers um to to model and to

225
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,520
simulate and analyze and optimize the

226
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,800
production process without a need for a

227
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,440
physical protot prototype within their

228
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,919
particular plant and a specific company

229
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,720
uh wistron a leading Electronics

230
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,360
manufacturer was able to achieve a 51%

231
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,520
boost in worker efficiency and 50%

232
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,120
reduction in production process times

233
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
using this particular solution as well

234
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,840
Volvo trucks another one that used this

235
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,120
really really well within their Super

236
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Truck 2 concept vehicle and of course

237
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,560
what they've achieved there is in

238
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,240
running the scenario modeling instead of

239
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,520
actually using specific prototypes we're

240
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,360
able to facilitate and succeed in

241
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,000
reducing drag by 50% over the previous

242
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,000
iterations as

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,440
well I love this quote the power of

244
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
digital twins is the ability to

245
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,400
visualize multiple different data

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,039
sources in a single model I love that

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,240
because it outlines the power what what

248
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,120
it can achieve this ultimately is what

249
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
we're all trying to achieve within the

250
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,039
the process of formulating a digital

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,959
twin but unfortunately it is also its

252
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,599
greatest challenge as well we'll talk

253
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,200
about the challenges as coming over the

254
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,800
next few minutes as well just some kind

255
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,560
of like mean conceptual ideas

256
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,039
classification digital twins are

257
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,240
classified in numerous different ways

258
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,360
depending on who you're talking to what

259
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,360
industry you're in and the most common

260
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,760
probably is by scale either through the

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
component level asset level systems um

262
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,080
think about it in a number of ways like

263
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,120
let's say a component level might be a

264
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,360
HVAC system with a bin a building or

265
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,320
even maybe a plane engine asset level

266
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,519
would be the building itself or a plane

267
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
if I'm using the the two different

268
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,000
analogies beside each other a systems of

269
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,120
assets might be a portfolio or

270
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,959
particular real estate and then a

271
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,000
multistem might be a smart city mean

272
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,959
environment out there which encompasses

273
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,519
numerous different elements of uh

274
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,200
digital twin

275
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,720
technology there has been of course vast

276
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,120
investment in this in in recent times

277
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,120
with the forecast for 2025 even

278
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
predicting sust substantial growth in

279
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,320
the adoption of this technology across

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,079
multiple Industries with somewhere in

281
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,680
the region of about I think $13 billion

282
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,640
invested last year and about 17 billion

283
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,079
on track to kind of investment in this

284
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,519
year with but that's not the really

285
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:48,880
really incredible statistic that's up on

286
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:51,320
the board 250 million or north of it I

287
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
mean by 2031 that's where that the

288
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,000
industry is seeing this kind of move by

289
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
in a very very short space of time as

290
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,760
well this is a technology people that

291
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,839
really see the true value of in a very

292
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,560
kind of

293
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,640
in multiple different

294
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,720
facets so going back to what a digital

295
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,839
twin is as I outlined before it is the

296
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,519
historical and real-time data coming

297
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,760
together to formulate different concepts

298
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,040
as well and they really complement each

299
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,000
other and provide really comprehensive

300
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,680
view of the assets past and present to

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
ultimately utilizing AI technology to

302
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,279
predict future behaviors and how they do

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,240
this and how they correlate it is

304
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,920
through a number of different Ventures

305
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,040
first is through the Baseline of trend

306
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,480
analysis

307
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,279
historical data really provides a

308
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,600
baseline of past performance and Trends

309
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,760
which is essential for understanding how

310
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,079
an asset has behaved over time and this

311
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,920
information is it's it's crucial for

312
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:47,639
identifying patterns and anomalies when

313
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,959
comparing to real-time data predictive

314
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,040
modeling which is an offshoot of

315
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,880
artificial intelligence in itself what

316
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,839
happens here is by analyzing historical

317
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,000
data the twins themselves can build

318
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,200
predictive models that anticipate future

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,720
events or failures

320
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,480
through simulation and scenario testing

321
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,480
the historical data allows digital twins

322
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,120
to simulate various scenarios by

323
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
understanding past conditions and

324
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,800
outcomes when combined with real-time

325
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,200
data these simulations can really be

326
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,839
adjusted dramatically to to can really

327
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,079
reflect the current conditions or State

328
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,800
of Affairs within a specific asset

329
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,680
providing a far more robust and

330
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,279
adaptable model as well you have of

331
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,200
course AI machine learning Within

332
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,040
digital Twins and that utilizes this

333
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,399
both both the historical and real-time

334
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,480
data to improve decision-making

335
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,360
processes you have synchronization and

336
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
validation which again using the

337
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,320
historical data helps validate the

338
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,399
real-time data providing a reference

339
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
point for comparison and ultimately

340
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,880
that's probably one of the biggest

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,279
issues that has taken place within the

342
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,320
real estate industry in the last few

343
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,639
years we'll talk about that in a few

344
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,440
minutes where that is kind of stand from

345
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,440
but overall the integration of

346
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,320
historical and real-time data in digital

347
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,800
twins really enables a far more holistic

348
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,160
IC understanding of the asset itself

349
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,839
leading to hopefully somewhere in their

350
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,000
really far better improved decision-

351
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,680
making and operational efficiency as

352
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,519
well so how is AI and digital twins

353
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,079
really kind of making this better well

354
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,120
AI is really driving and revolutionizing

355
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,440
the digital twin by

356
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,480
enhancing not only the data collection

357
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,079
but also the integration process within

358
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,360
a particular system as well and through

359
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,320
AI sensor Technologies they're really

360
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,199
helping facilitate digital twins to

361
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,040
gather enormous volumes of realtime data

362
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,160
within the physical world these sensors

363
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,519
you know can include far more complex

364
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,920
ones like computer vision cameras or iot

365
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,320
devices as well as more conventional

366
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,720
ones like you know simple ones that we

367
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,959
see I've seen for a number of years like

368
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,160
temperature and pressure sensors and

369
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,440
then through using AI algorithms this

370
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,720
data is interpreted it's filtered

371
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,600
processed to make much more useful and

372
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,800
create far more actionable insight

373
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,880
within that system as well enabling the

374
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,680
digital twin really then to to integrate

375
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,399
the data from diverse sources and and

376
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,079
and and different components you know

377
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,440
and a far more seamless capability as

378
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,160
well so if you were to take for instance

379
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,000
a smart city or of a digital twin and

380
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,079
take all of the different data from

381
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,920
traffic cameras or weather stations or

382
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,519
even social media feeds to analyze in

383
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,680
real time to then formulate in situation

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,560
to optimize something quite complex in

385
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,199
traffic flow patterns but let's add in a

386
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
little bit of in issue with adverse

387
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,120
weather conditions as well well then we

388
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,800
have a system where ai's ability to

389
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,000
process all of that very difficult

390
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,000
unstructured data such as texts or

391
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,079
images really helps facilitate and

392
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,199
enriches the digital twins understanding

393
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,000
of its surroundings around

394
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,079
that

395
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,839
um because we're in iot devices just in

396
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,120
case anyone just what that is and what

397
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,959
they are quite simply is iot sensors are

398
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,120
really just physical devices equipped

399
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,040
from different sensors that capture data

400
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,440
from the the the physical

401
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,759
world and these centers can measure

402
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,519
extreme you know a wide range of

403
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,959
perimeters including temperature uh

404
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,759
humidity pressure space optimization

405
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,560
presence vibration lights and anything

406
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,079
you can really think of at any given end

407
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,040
time and all of this data is then

408
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,440
collected by these centers is really

409
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,959
creating an accurate up-to-date

410
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,720
representation of what's taking place

411
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,560
within a

412
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,920
system so within the Realms of real

413
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,360
estate what does that mean what is a

414
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,399
digital twin capable of doing well

415
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,120
really a digital twin can provide kind

416
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,279
of two two two really valuable um

417
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,959
elements it can provide a transformative

418
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,079
solution really in the development and

419
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,920
the operations of a building or a built

420
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,120
environment situation itself as well and

421
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,000
what it does is it can provide a a a

422
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,079
virtual representation of exactly what's

423
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,759
taking place in an up like I mean at

424
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,399
this moment in time within a particular

425
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,839
building or a city and then far more

426
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,800
importantly what happens is that it

427
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,480
allows for that forecast and scenario

428
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,600
modeling to take place within that

429
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,440
system so let's take a building for

430
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,639
instance how

431
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,720
would we've never really been able to

432
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,880
have an R&D situation for our buildings

433
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,680
we've never really been able to do that

434
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,120
because it simply it just it costs too

435
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,279
much you put a new system in you can't

436
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,000
just take it out because you don't like

437
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,480
it or it's not not working at an optimal

438
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,839
level what happens now with a new kind

439
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
of dynamic situation of digital

440
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,680
technology that would allow you to

441
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,120
better understand

442
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,040
how a new HVAC system would cope and

443
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,319
operate within a system what would a new

444
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,240
space optimization configuration within

445
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:43,480
a building look like and how would the

446
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,199
asset react to it what would happen if a

447
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,079
new heat pump was installed within the

448
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,600
building what would the reaction be what

449
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,600
if one of the

450
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,720
new

451
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,519
helpful um AI enabled HPA systems that

452
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,480
could can transpose the cold air from

453
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,240
one floor into the cold air down into

454
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,560
another floor that needs it without

455
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,440
actually utilizing or producing any

456
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,759
other cold air within it to really

457
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,079
utilize all of the different elements

458
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,079
within a space that's when we start to

459
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,079
see real value within the real estate

460
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,000
industry across different buildings and

461
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,120
ultimately what we're trying to achieve

462
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,800
is to help facilitate a situation that

463
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,680
the highest and best use of all of the

464
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,639
space within that is getting

465
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,759
utilized some examples that are right

466
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,279
there in the real world one of my

467
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,920
favorites that has been around for quite

468
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,360
some time has been Nan young Tech

469
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,360
technology University in Singapore this

470
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,040
is a 50 hectare special purpose uh built

471
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,040
campus that has about 8 to n years into

472
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,519
a 10-year buildout and they've been

473
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,560
focusing on trying to create a a digital

474
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,839
twin for that entire time and they've

475
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,319
they've really seen and yielded

476
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,639
incredible results in some ways I mean

477
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,880
with a 31% reduction in energy

478
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,839
consumption however I want to be fair on

479
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,600
this a lot of that was through trial and

480
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,120
error as well it wasn't just automatic

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,720
straight off the bat some other ones um

482
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,160
the uh inam uh city in in Korea have

483
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,199
done some fantastic work um with one of

484
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,360
the ones that they've built out with

485
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,839
fire response traffic control but one of

486
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,880
my favorite Parts is the realtime

487
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,360
monitoring system response to Rising

488
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
mosquito born diseases which has been

489
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,679
extremely helpful within that particular

490
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,360
twin and of course Singapore as well

491
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,480
which has really been at the Forefront

492
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,039
of developing and and implementing an

493
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,200
urban digital twin um uh for for a

494
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,160
number of years now since 2014 their

495
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,799
smart Nation uh initiative this has come

496
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,679
with Incredible successes but also has

497
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,679
really shown us what the real true

498
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,240
challenges are for digital twin we've

499
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,120
seen a numerous different companies come

500
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,320
and go within this initiative Bentley

501
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,120
systems been part of it and have left

502
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,440
but the challenges themselves you know

503
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,039
have been really um instrumental in

504
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,440
helping other people better understand

505
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,320
that through the standardization of data

506
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,679
and the complexity that comes with that

507
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
as well as the implementation of a

508
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,840
number of different systems out there to

509
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,000
Showcase where where things can go

510
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,080
wrong

511
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,559
um one of the kind of one of my favorite

512
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,159
particular twin projects that has taken

513
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,200
place here in the United States is what

514
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:12,559
is a video clip that I'm just going to

515
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,120
show next um I'm going to use a video I

516
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,520
apologize but I just cannot I can't use

517
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,240
my words I'm not a like like I feel like

518
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,159
I'm talking to my son all right I can't

519
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,039
use my big boy words in order to to just

520
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,480
describe how fantastic this next project

521
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,320
is this is put together by Brookfield

522
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,440
asset manager one of the largest office

523
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,960
owners and and re

524
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,480
real estate owners here in the United

525
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,600
States along with Willow which is a dzel

526
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,600
twin technology here in in the United

527
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,919
States and Microsoft aor I just kind of

528
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,919
give you kind of a quick bit of insight

529
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,880
with this

530
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:47,720
one Willow twin is a digital replica of

531
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,039
exactly what the building is made up of

532
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,799
all the security scalability Cloud AI

533
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,840
technologies that Willow leverages

534
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,240
inside of the willow twin are a

535
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,559
fundamental component inside of the

536
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,360
Azure digital twin stack it's comprised

537
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,280
of the architectural drawings the

538
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,840
heating ventilation and air conditioning

539
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,600
systems the building automation system

540
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,320
occupancy sensor networks all of the

541
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,559
equipment that goes into the building

542
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,760
there's over 40,000 data points and we

543
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,360
can look at all of these systems

544
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,400
together in real time and understand how

545
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,640
one is affecting the other and respond

546
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,960
to

547
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,880
that that's one of my favorite kind of

548
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,600
visualizations of this that particular

549
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
technology that's one Manhattan West

550
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,919
which is basically the first building

551
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,919
you hit when you come out a pen station

552
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,880
going towards hoods and yards it's a

553
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
phenomenal building just to see it and

554
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,039
just as a building in itself but the

555
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,159
project that they've been working on

556
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,520
there has really kind of led the way for

557
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,640
a lot of digital twin understanding and

558
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,799
quite simply that video is three years

559
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,640
old and it's only now that they're

560
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,000
starting to really reap the benefits of

561
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,400
all of the implementation of all of the

562
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
systems that they built into it so with

563
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,039
that what this what does this all mean

564
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,039
what is the the impact of digital twin

565
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,600
which is an a enable technology on real

566
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:04,159
estate what does it all mean for for for

567
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,320
our cities and for our buildings and how

568
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,360
what are the true benefits that we're

569
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,640
able to to kind of De Garner out of this

570
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,200
particular technology well first and

571
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,320
foremost at a city planning level

572
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,280
digital twins will enable far more

573
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,320
efficient and sustainable Urban

574
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,120
Development planners will be able to

575
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,360
essentially simulate various scenarios

576
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,640
and assess the impact of new

577
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,960
developments and optimize infrastructure

578
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,720
planning and that's extremely helpful

579
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,120
you know across different cities even

580
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,360
across the way here with the the new

581
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,799
with a we have a incredible site across

582
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,360
the way here that that MIT built and the

583
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,799
team at the city science lab but Kent

584
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,320
Larson team have done an incredible job

585
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,520
in creating their their own virtual

586
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,440
representation of that and that's all to

587
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,360
help facilitate a better understanding

588
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,280
of what of trying to ensure that

589
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,679
everybody gets the most out of new

590
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,440
developments going forward and from that

591
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,799
all right cities then can create

592
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,159
detailed virtual replicas to help

593
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,440
facilitate with their management now

594
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,240
there are no number of different kind of

595
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,240
iterations of this across the the US

596
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,760
that have been utilized but one of my

597
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,400
favorite ones is Lake Nona down in um

598
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,760
down in Orlando in Florida Lake non is a

599
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,960
a 7,000 acre master plan development

600
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,320
it's a it's a monstrosity it's the like

601
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,279
if you know the Irvine Company over in

602
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,880
California it's one of those ones in

603
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,000
fact this is their small one they have

604
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,240
one next door that's closer to 22,000

605
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,600
acres to be developed but they've

606
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,799
started building out in the last three

607
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,320
years a digital twin within their

608
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,799
Community as well using

609
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,480
Google Map API GIS parcel data building

610
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:39,520
topography data uh pedestrian traffic

611
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:43,080
flow um occupancy level iot within the

612
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,000
spaces um traffic uh heat maps all of

613
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,200
them to create one of the most really

614
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,720
fantastic digal twin platforms that I've

615
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
seen for an entire Community here in the

616
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,360
United States and it really is a

617
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,440
fantastic product that they that they

618
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,520
have um some of the low hanging food of

619
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
course improved maintenance and

620
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,960
operations one of the most immediate

621
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,000
benefits of digital twins is of course

622
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,120
predictive maintenance and you know I

623
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,559
when I showed this sometime people

624
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,039
always go but we've seen that with IBM

625
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,159
Watson for you know four or five years

626
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,600
ago on on a Super Bowl ad nothing really

627
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,000
came of it well it nothing really came

628
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,240
of it because it kind of goes back to

629
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,520
that situation that I was talking about

630
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
earlier with historical and real-time

631
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,320
data we thought we had the historical

632
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
data but we really didn't we didn't have

633
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,000
a standardization and it's probably

634
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,039
taken till now to get the data to a

635
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,799
level that we can understand it utilize

636
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,320
it Benchmark it then from that make

637
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,840
better decisions from that as well and

638
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,760
then this can really help facilitate

639
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,799
analy and and create a pro a proactive

640
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,120
approach that of course will reduce the

641
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,559
downtime within spaces save costs and

642
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,279
ultimately add value to uh to to uh to

643
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
real estate

644
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,520
assets

645
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,799
um datadriven

646
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,400
decision-making digital twin of course

647
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,559
will provide a wealth of data that can

648
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,520
be analyzed for insights and Trends and

649
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,880
helping Property Owners make much better

650
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:08,200
strategic decisions and plan for the

651
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,120
future the office Market's not exactly

652
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,640
in the best place it's ever been right

653
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,480
now this is the exact type of technology

654
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,360
that can help facilitate owners and

655
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,880
operators with understanding what's

656
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,320
needed what's necessary and what the

657
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,240
true value is of trying to get the the

658
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,480
the best value out of what what assets

659
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,000
they have at this moment in time and it

660
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,000
can ultimately only be be a a a really

661
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,480
true value add for them I canot have

662
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
this conversation without sustainability

663
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,600
and

664
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
decarbonization for the real estate

665
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,400
industry this is the elephant in the

666
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,600
room we have incredibly

667
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,000
complex regulation coming down the

668
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,679
pipeline with local on 97 Berto here in

669
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,200
Boston it's only going to get more

670
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,240
bigger and stronger over the course of

671
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,000
the next few years as well well digital

672
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,120
twin technology can play a crucial role

673
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,919
in sustainability efforts by identifying

674
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,880
he eting Cooling and efficiencies within

675
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,960
spaces generating detailed energy usage

676
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,840
statistics and more importantly where I

677
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,880
think the true value is is helping

678
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,080
facilitate informed targeted

679
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,840
retrofitting capabilities within spaces

680
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,240
that have been underutilized or have may

681
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,360
be defunct depending on certain demands

682
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,400
at this point in time and this of course

683
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,799
will help reduce carbon emissions that

684
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,080
align with all of these uh global

685
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:27,600
climate change uh regulations that are

686
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,600
coming down the pipeline

687
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,520
where am I Facilities

688
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,279
Management Facility management companies

689
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,520
are really leveraging digital twins to

690
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,559
help facilitate and optimizing building

691
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,720
performance um and reduce of course

692
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:43,880
their operational costs this is always

693
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,480
going to be of importance within the

694
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,279
real estate industry from an investment

695
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,679
perspective and by integrating iot

696
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,360
devices and data analytics facilitated

697
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,520
and driven by AI technology these

698
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,880
digital twin will really help provide

699
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,960
the insight and help create a far more

700
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,960
comfortable

701
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,440
um and an environmentally responsible

702
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,120
workplace for anyone within the space as

703
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,559
well they this is probably one of the

704
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,360
biggest markets for digital twin and

705
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,760
real estate and they can use it to

706
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,520
analyze the building performance um

707
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,840
optimize operations and create the best

708
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,600
possible space for the people that are

709
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,520
within that within that

710
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,320
environment of course collaboration

711
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,679
stakeholder engagement again a very

712
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,600
useful tool helping to

713
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,440
to really help facilitate collaboration

714
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,320
among stakeholders by offering you know

715
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,640
a real true understanding of a real-time

716
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,039
platform for interaction for those I

717
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
can't show it here but for those of you

718
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,120
who who get a moment please take a look

719
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,480
at immerses project down in Tampa with

720
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,080
their Water Street project this is an

721
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,399
incredible interactive model that

722
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,000
integrates both massing and analytics

723
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,760
into One Singular interactive tool to

724
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,279
that's been presented in a realtime

725
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,120
projection of the of this particular

726
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,520
development with Incredible different

727
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,640
elements of data that have come together

728
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,880
to Showcase this this project this

729
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,399
project to all of the different

730
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,919
stakeholders within

731
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,960
it

732
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,279
now everything I've just said here

733
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,600
digital Twin's amazing it's going to

734
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,440
change the world this is a simple easy

735
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,480
as got to use it it's going to change

736
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,840
everything but that's not simply the

737
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,559
case the media coverage of digital twin

738
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,000
over the last few years has been

739
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,840
extremely positive but if you look at

740
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,360
all these these headlines This Is 2020

741
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,360
2021 digital twin has been as a concept

742
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,279
in real estate has been around but has

743
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,880
it fundamentally really made a

744
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,399
difference or made a change

745
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,039
within within real estate absolutely not

746
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:36,960
it has come across significant

747
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,440
challenges but why I mean do I still

748
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,240
believe in it do I still think that it's

749
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,480
a a gamechanging technology absolutely

750
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,320
through the evolution of AI capabilities

751
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,640
generative AI capabilities and more

752
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,799
importantly facilitation of the data

753
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,080
which we didn't necessarily have before

754
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,279
this is only going to get stronger and

755
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,440
it's only going to get better there's

756
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,200
been significant barriers to adoption

757
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,720
the difficulty of course in measuring

758
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,000
and demonstrating a return on investment

759
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,840
with any new technology is of vital

760
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,640
importance for any particular uh

761
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,520
industry but but but real estate are

762
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,520
probably one of the hardest people to to

763
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,480
really get on board behind this the

764
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,880
likes of what you saw with Brookfield

765
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,159
that's they are they're an outlier

766
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,720
they're a team that's really taken a

767
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:18,520
chance they put a lot of effort a lot of

768
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,120
money and a lot of time into creating

769
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,200
something new and something Dynamic but

770
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,240
they do believe that they're now

771
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,279
starting to see the the True Value at

772
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,279
the end of that and in the next few

773
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,880
months what you're going to see coming

774
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,679
out of that project is really quite a

775
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,640
standard some of the some of the levels

776
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,320
of of um of of efficiencies that they've

777
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,640
been able to create with

778
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,520
it um another issue is

779
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,159
interoperability which has been one of

780
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,720
the biggest CH uh challenges in

781
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,960
utilizing this technology because of its

782
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,760
ability of different platforms different

783
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,760
data providers to work closely or

784
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,159
together or seamlessly and this

785
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,880
ultimately requires a huge amount of

786
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,840
standardization and collaboration across

787
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,159
an industry

788
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,840
but because ultimately how data is

789
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,480
constructed how it's pared how it's

790
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,720
synthesized how it's gathered is

791
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,480
different depending on City environment

792
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,840
software building and anything else but

793
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,519
we've actually had a number of different

794
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,919
initiatives across Europe and here in

795
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,919
the United States trying to facilitate a

796
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,799
common digital twin language a HTML if

797
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,240
you will for digital twin technology or

798
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,640
even a a dtml is how they try to

799
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,399
describe it and that's something you're

800
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,279
starting to see a lot more kind of in in

801
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:26,159
in

802
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,279
process of course the cost and

803
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,559
complexity The Upfront cost of

804
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,760
implementing this technology is

805
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,840
significant and that's you know it's not

806
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,840
everybody it's not going to be this is

807
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,159
not for your average real estate owner

808
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,440
at this moment in time but that's not to

809
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,799
say that in a couple of years that this

810
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,840
won't be part and parcel of every single

811
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,480
operation out there just like we've seen

812
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,159
with liar technology over the last few

813
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,039
years the cost of iot sensors the cost

814
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,960
of the the the analytic capabilities

815
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,919
behind that is coming down significantly

816
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,200
to a point that this will be mainstream

817
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:02,360
in a not too distant future

818
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,360
so with that digital twin technology is

819
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,919
really you know it's really starting to

820
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,640
revolutionize certain aspects of

821
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,720
commercial real estate by really

822
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,559
facilitating and enhancing the improved

823
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
management and operations within a lot

824
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,840
of the systems to help obviously support

825
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,760
sustainability efforts um improve

826
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,559
marketing and create the best possible

827
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,320
efficienc efficiency levels within a lot

828
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,880
of

829
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,880
organizations and as the as the industry

830
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,720
starts or continues to embrace

831
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,000
this digital transformation I have no

832
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,200
doubts that digital twin will play a

833
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,039
crucial role in future proofing a number

834
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,559
of real estate assets and driving

835
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,320
Innovation um everything I've said to

836
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,360
you here is not necessarily coming off

837
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,880
the fence a lot of you've seen this

838
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,200
before you've you know you've you've

839
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,320
seen certainly the concepts before but

840
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,600
for me I'm going to just kind of I'm

841
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,279
going to give a little bit of my own

842
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,320
personal opinion on this which is always

843
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,679
very dangerous and a room like this here

844
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,840
but ultimately probably one of the

845
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,640
biggest issues we've seen in trying to

846
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,279
push digital twin technology forward

847
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,519
especially in real estate has been

848
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:10,960
implementing the data with the the

849
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,600
visualization component and if I were to

850
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,039
actually say it I mean going forward I

851
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,440
don't necessarily believe that is

852
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:18,840
ultimately even necessary what we

853
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,279
probably need really need is just a

854
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,320
digital integration platform that can

855
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,440
take the data can analyze it and then

856
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,279
from that with the power of generative

857
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,279
AI really just help facilitate from with

858
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,720
the decision- making of the The

859
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,760
Operators or the property managers and

860
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,679
facility managers to tell them exactly

861
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,200
what to do to take the data that they

862
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,679
have generate a very simple report and

863
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,039
from that let them go and do their work

864
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,960
and that's probably what we're going to

865
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:45,200
see in the not too distant future if if

866
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,120
that we're not already seeing it this

867
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,720
year alone as well and that's probably

868
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,159
this the kind of the lwh hanging frood

869
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,279
value within all of this

870
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:55,559
but the history of digital twin

871
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,480
technology really reflects a journey of

872
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,200
innovation and adaption and when you're

873
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,000
talking about something like things like

874
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,720
with Innovation and adaption things do

875
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,320
take time there is a struggle there is a

876
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,720
there is a sort of a a moment where you

877
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,679
kind of have to step off the cliff and

878
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,000
kind of embrace it and take it all and

879
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,039
ultimately we're starting to see people

880
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,440
start to do that and more importantly

881
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,799
see the benefits with that as well and

882
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,559
so the future for this particular

883
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,679
element within this industry I think is

884
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,360
extremely uh extremely bright and we're

885
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,399
going to only see more of

886
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:29,360
it um so with that thank you very much

887
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,200
um if any of you you didn't hear a word

888
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,559
I said and I was speaking way too fast I

889
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,679
apologize but uh I'd love to have some

890
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,920
questions um if you uh if you have any

891
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:44,080
oh wow we we've loads of

892
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:47,080
[Applause]

893
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,080
questions

894
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,360
um yeah answer the sure question okay

895
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,919
I'm going to pick the easy ones the

896
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,480
sports ones okay okay is digital twin

897
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,279
better than smaller methods that use

898
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,159
less data how does it differ in terms of

899
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,159
cases and

900
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,159
accuracy

901
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,799
um smaller methods that use less data

902
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,320
well for me when and I'm I'm going to

903
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:16,240
infer that the question is like I mean

904
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,519
different components within a different

905
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,639
or a of a building so a smaller method

906
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,399
might be utilizing the information or

907
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,960
data of a HVAC

908
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,960
system or understanding the Energy

909
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Efficiency of of a particular space or

910
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
the space optimization they're all

911
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
fantastic and they all work really well

912
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,279
but why not put them all together

913
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,799
because when you put them all together

914
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,880
you have a far better understanding of

915
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,240
what's taking place within your space

916
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,039
and so it's not a case of whether one is

917
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,720
better one as the other or than the

918
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:48,279
other I think it's a necessary Evolution

919
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,600
that you put all of these things into

920
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,559
one into one product to give you the

921
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,240
best understanding and from that what

922
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,120
you can do is make the best decisions

923
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,399
possible with not just your building but

924
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,679
with your portfolio of assets because

925
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,559
you need to have all of these things

926
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,159
together because they're not mutually

927
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,360
exclusive right like if you decide to

928
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,840
reduce your budget on a HVAC system and

929
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,360
It

930
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,679
ultimately you know it cranks out on you

931
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,760
in the middle of winter or during the

932
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,480
summer when people need it the most it's

933
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,639
going to affect your occupancy levels

934
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,480
it's going to affect the tenant within

935
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:23,240
it it's going to affect the wellness the

936
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,519
health the people that utilize the space

937
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,399
so the information you get for one

938
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,440
system is good but more information is

939
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,039
always better it gives you a far better

940
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,559
kind of train of insight within that I I

941
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,559
think I've answered that

942
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,480
question

943
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,960
um do you have some figures about Roi of

944
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,399
such Technologies with real estate cases

945
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,799
well I gave one that we had up on the

946
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:46,320
screen there was n young technology

947
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,679
University like mean through their

948
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,159
campus there have a 30% reduction in

949
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,559
operation or sorry with energy energy

950
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,679
usage I think that's probably an unfair

951
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,919
example because they've they've utilized

952
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,320
a trial and error scenario in lots of

953
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,679
respects of how to figure out which

954
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,120
works and what doesn't work the data

955
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,240
that will come out and like I can't get

956
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,560
into it just it's it's not it's not time

957
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,079
for it to be released but the

958
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,280
information that will come out from one

959
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,200
Manhattan West in around November or

960
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,520
December when that report is released I

961
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,119
think will be of

962
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,399
significant uh to to the marketplace

963
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,679
where they have a much better

964
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,280
understanding of how how valuable this

965
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,520
is and essentially all of the parameters

966
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm not giving too much away here but

967
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,440
all of the things that they've

968
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,280
ultimately tried to achieve or they

969
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,879
thought that they would hit they with

970
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,000
the exception of maybe one and they were

971
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,000
off by maybe 1% they they they've hit

972
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,280
all of their targets so this is

973
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,879
something that can really help

974
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,440
facilitate a true reduction in energy

975
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,200
and one thing I can talk about is I know

976
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,839
that over the course of the next 10

977
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,079
years it'll ultimately save them

978
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,200
somewhere close to about $60 million in

979
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,200
operational

980
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,200
expenses

981
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,000
um how useful could digital twins be for

982
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,560
evaluating potential damage to a

983
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,040
building from things like fire flood

984
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,320
wind I think like I mean a number of

985
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,599
different um insurance companies already

986
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,720
looking at this um to better understand

987
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,320
it um

988
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,280
but the problem with this is you have to

989
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,240
ask what's the true value like I mean if

990
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,480
a building is damaged by fire ultimately

991
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,440
it gets demolished like I mean it

992
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,560
doesn't matter what a digital mean it's

993
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,320
more trying to Res if the resiliency I

994
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,160
think is or maybe that is the question

995
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,760
if the resiliency of certain materials

996
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,599
and the resiliency of certain components

997
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,480
within a system that can help probably

998
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:36,440
better understand it how a sprinkler

999
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,640
system might work or how it might curate

1000
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,119
a situation to create the as less as

1001
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,200
little damage as possible in one of

1002
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,119
those horrific situations I think is

1003
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,960
where this would go and there's

1004
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,280
absolutely you know it will be of course

1005
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,640
immense value um I know one of the the

1006
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,040
ILP members is FM Global there's anyone

1007
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,640
FM Global members in the audience but

1008
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,760
like they have yeah you guys have a

1009
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,319
campus stand in Rhode Island where you

1010
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,560
kind of do that you do it naturally you

1011
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:05,280
don't need a digital twin yeah

1012
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,480
yeah

1013
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,920
um

1014
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,880
okay anyone anyone I want to ask a

1015
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,079
question from the audience put their

1016
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,680
hand up anyone feeling brave enough just

1017
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,119
got a feel bad just picking questions

1018
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,560
out off

1019
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,160
offline make this a

1020
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,119
classroom yes sir

1021
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,240
look some

1022
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:33,680
experiment uh we found that

1023
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:36,319
sometime the question is CL close to the

1024
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,680
business situation we are in the finance

1025
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:43,920
security not a real estate yeah how you

1026
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,599
advise Beyond this real estate which

1027
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,920
have a building concrete you can see

1028
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,760
heat pipes you can you can feel it but

1029
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,880
in a more Finance or other let say

1030
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,760
retail type of

1031
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,760
Industry so

1032
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:05,319
I'm going to try I'm going to try

1033
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,960
to yeah so I think he's asking

1034
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,680
me the physical components of a digital

1035
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,000
twin allow it to be kind of assessed

1036
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,079
quite a little bit more simply but can

1037
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,599
you transfer that particular technology

1038
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:21,640
and an understanding to other elements

1039
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,760
like retail scenarios or financial

1040
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,040
modeling I for me I don't think that's

1041
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,560
what a digital twin is because for me a

1042
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,119
digital twin is a 3D virtual

1043
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,119
representation of a physical system or

1044
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,240
physical asset what I think you're

1045
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,359
talking about and we have numerous

1046
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,920
different kind of variations of it is a

1047
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,000
not of a lot of Quant analysis that

1048
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,599
takes place on on on Wall Street already

1049
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,400
I I mean with different components in

1050
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,920
retail we have it in understanding the

1051
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,960
power of the consumer be it uh

1052
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,200
walkability space and there's a there's

1053
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
a really interesting team at there

1054
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,240
called

1055
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,640
Pro know Placer Placer that really help

1056
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,760
better understand all of how how how

1057
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,920
people use the retail space how much

1058
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,040
they're buying how much they're buying

1059
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,960
around different environments so I I I

1060
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,800
think there's an awful lot of

1061
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,839
AI powered analysis systems that are out

1062
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,720
there but I don't necessarily I wouldn't

1063
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,040
consider them a digital twin because for

1064
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,839
me I think you need to have a physical

1065
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,440
component to it to be to be considered

1066
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,440
that that digital

1067
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,359
twin anyone

1068
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:33,839
else yep so um it's two question one is

1069
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:37,079
of you only get one no no no no no howly

1070
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,079
do you need to

1071
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,880
start so great great question well I'll

1072
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,839
come back to you let me let me answer

1073
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,400
we'll do them in Parts all right so the

1074
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,319
earlier you put it into the system

1075
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,599
obviously the better all right I mean so

1076
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:58,560
a lot of buildings that you're going to

1077
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,200
see can constructed over the next few

1078
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,280
years are going to have that componentry

1079
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,280
that capability of iot sensors powered

1080
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,640
and that optionality to integrate new

1081
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,800
systems within the building

1082
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,720
automatically and that will be from the

1083
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,839
evolution of even Bim systems themselves

1084
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,599
as well where you will probably see a

1085
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,880
situation where they'll take the Bim

1086
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,640
construction people have used Bim before

1087
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,520
that Bim virtual representation of the

1088
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,200
space and utilize and funnel in the data

1089
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,520
to give them that capability of having

1090
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
an understanding from an operational

1091
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,119
component going forward

1092
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,640
trying to do it with an older building

1093
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,280
we've seen it happen but it's it's

1094
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,480
harder it's like everything it's like

1095
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,480
with this trying to create a new

1096
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,560
sustainable sustainability effort within

1097
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,440
an older space it's just harder because

1098
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,680
they weren't built with that purpose in

1099
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,160
mind and of course you know the team

1100
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,400
that comes up with been able to do that

1101
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,880
with an older space well look at mean

1102
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,400
they're not they're going to be flying

1103
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,960
in on a private jet the next time that

1104
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,319
they come all right because that's

1105
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,720
that's that's where the real money is

1106
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,720
it's you know it's great to be able to

1107
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,200
implement these within new places but

1108
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,480
ultimately if you can do it with the

1109
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,640
majority of older stock that's out there

1110
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,680
that's that's the game changer that's

1111
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,200
the ultimate where we're trying to go so

1112
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,200
my second

1113
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:15,400
question is who are the decision makers

1114
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,400
that it seems to me that once you're

1115
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,640
already's

1116
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:25,280
decision or

1117
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,000
is oh you've just you've opened up a

1118
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,079
whole kind of worms there haven't you um

1119
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,200
so just ask the question again who the

1120
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,200
decision maker

1121
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,079
for who do you talk to to make sure are

1122
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,880
you talking about to implement it or to

1123
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,359
take the to take the the the Insight

1124
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,760
that it provides and then go and do

1125
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,760
something with

1126
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,079
itel yeah

1127
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
that that's probably a corporate

1128
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,920
question to be fair but I'm going to try

1129
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm going to try and give a little bit

1130
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,920
of an answer to it there's a number of

1131
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,319
people that are involved with the

1132
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,800
process like with anything right when

1133
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,800
you want to implement a new software a

1134
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,520
new structure but the important part and

1135
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,720
this kind of is a big Fear Factor for a

1136
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,800
lot of people because one of the big

1137
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,520
issues with adoption for digital twin is

1138
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,119
of course the facility manager the

1139
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,839
property manager the asset manager they

1140
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,560
see a technology like this here and it

1141
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,920
scares them because they think hold on

1142
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,119
I'm going to be out of a job very soon

1143
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,160
because this is going to take over and

1144
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,040
automate all of the systems in

1145
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,680
process that that's not how we see it

1146
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,280
all right what we see is that this

1147
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,400
provides the ultimate insight into

1148
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,960
what's taking place within the space so

1149
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,319
that that decision maker whoever that

1150
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,920
person might be that utilizes this can

1151
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:49,920
make the best decision possible and give

1152
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,720
them the foresight and actually if I'm

1153
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,440
going to go further I love given my

1154
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,599
opinion because it causes far more

1155
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,960
arguments than anything all right it we

1156
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,760
have had that in the real estate

1157
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,760
industry for a number of years and this

1158
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,359
goes back to the that first question the

1159
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,319
smaller iterations of data that are

1160
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:08,160
available out there the problem with the

1161
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,960
real estate industry is they've actually

1162
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,599
been inundated with so much data and so

1163
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,560
much Insight that they forgot who their

1164
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,480
target Mark that person that's using is

1165
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,319
and with the greatest of respect they

1166
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,240
didn't go to MIT they didn't go to

1167
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,000
Harvard they didn't go to Princeton they

1168
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,079
people that work in the real estate

1169
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,760
industry for 20 30 years and they see

1170
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,480
you know lines of code at the top of a

1171
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,599
an interface with pie charts and graphs

1172
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,520
that are showcasing the optimization of

1173
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,240
certain of their Chiller system or their

1174
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,640
or their heating system and they

1175
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,200
ultimately don't know what to do with it

1176
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,760
and so they have no real kind of

1177
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,680
pragmatic way to take it but that's

1178
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,440
where gen C comes in all right so let's

1179
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,319
say we have that in front of the

1180
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,920
individual and you say push the button

1181
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,800
we don't necessarily need the virtual

1182
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,720
representation we just have a

1183
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,280
simple interface with all of the

1184
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,480
systems coming into play and you say

1185
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,040
generate report all right and it

1186
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,400
generates three very easy to read

1187
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,599
paragraphs that anybody can understand

1188
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,720
and from that they can make decisions

1189
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,559
boiler number two is running at optimal

1190
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,079
levels boiler number four looks like it

1191
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,680
could do with a service because it's

1192
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,960
overheating at certain times during the

1193
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,440
day all right literally it's writing it

1194
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,319
out for the person so they can take it

1195
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,960
and they can use it and make it work and

1196
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:26,559
that's the missing step for a lot of

1197
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,280
this it's why we haven't had a lot of

1198
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,200
the adoption with a lot of prop tech

1199
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,559
software and a lot of prop Tech products

1200
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,240
because ultimately that last step didn't

1201
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,960
really take place but I think ai's

1202
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:42,720
capability specifically jni is

1203
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:44,520
ultimately a huge missing link for the

1204
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,319
the the the property managers and the

1205
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,319
facility managers who can ultimately now

1206
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,839
use this data at a far more efficient

1207
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:54,000
level okay I'm I'm out of time I've got

1208
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,440
to leave you've had enough of me listen

1209
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,440
thank you so much
