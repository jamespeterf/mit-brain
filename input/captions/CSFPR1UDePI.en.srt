1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,039
okay any question U problem set four was

2
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:22,039
just turned in a couple people have um

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,560
have asked for and been granted uh small

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,560
extensions on that so I'm not going to

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,160
uh be talking through the solution set

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,520
today but anything that came up that you

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,120
found interesting appalling uh strange

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,879
Adam for the T and the I I use that o of

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,239
n factorial algorithm the O of n

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,520
factorial algorithm how how high can n

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,280
get 25

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,520
25 for what so if I had 25 notes and I

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,440
was trying to find optic or obdc it

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,160
turns out within a few seconds yep so so

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,440
with the O so you have an O of n

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,519
factorial algorithm which is uh usually

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,960
one of the worst you'd ever be thinking

18
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,640
about except for n to the n n to the n's

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,920
worst right I can't remember there the

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
types of things as a professional music

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,040
person you don't really have to think

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,320
once you're thinking about things this

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,640
bad you usually don't but um but yeah uh

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,920
25 was the number that I was weirdly

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,840
thinking that would constrain n anybody

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,600
have a different number that often comes

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,119
up in music for the max the end yeah 12

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,439
12 with 12 pictures so you can end up

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,640
with an algorithm that is O of 12

30
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:43,240
factorial which is decently big but not

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:47,119
too bad um which reduces to O of one one

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,799
very slow one but o of one so I don't

33
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,439
think that that would be that bad I

34
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,600
believe there is an there is an

35
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:58,280
algorithm that runs in uh o of n time I

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,600
believe yeah or it may it might be o of

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,439
n^2 I'll look back at it so there is a

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,159
way to go better but good good for this

39
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,039
class again we're not you're not going

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,440
to be quizzed on your algorithmic

41
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:13,480
complexity of your um work but um it's

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,560
always a good thing to be thinking about

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,440
as we uh do things I've um I took the

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,440
summer to look through all the places

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,400
where I wasn't using Heap tables I don't

46
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,040
know if

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,840
anybody do they cover heaps in 6 uh

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,840
69 or

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,760
66 okay yeah so the idea of an

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,920
organization that allows you to any

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,640
point get the smallest or the largest

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,400
value but not everything else is sorted

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,000
and that can be a very useful um tool

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,640
often but good but most of the things

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,879
aren't going to be on that any other

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,200
questions or weird concerns that come

57
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,760
up I'll be curious out after class to

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,760
figure out where 25 comes from I just

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,120
put in 25 notes and then C actually

60
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,239
killed a lot of effort yeah yeah so so

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
as long as you do your cardinality or

62
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,040
your what's the other

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,920
one oh yeah but what's what's the op

64
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,799
octave yeah sorry I was hearing optic

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,040
but but you were saying octave which is

66
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,840
correct as long as you've done something

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,280
like that you're Pro an op the OPC which

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,599
is almost always um a requirement for

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,840
using t or I because the transposition

70
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,319
operation um in some or the

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,159
transposition in operations can in some

72
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,799
cases not be well defined if especially

73
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,400
if you're thinking of a chord um what

74
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,799
when you invert it does do the order the

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,760
notes change in a Melody the order you

76
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,319
know obviously matters more good yeah

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,959
can you give some intuition for when

78
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,040
inversion is useful I like in doing the

79
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,879
assignment I just to wrap yeah yeah so

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,000
what when is it useful the one of the

81
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,799
first um reasons why it can be uh useful

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,680
is a lot of composers have thought it

83
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,560
useful including um tal composers like

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,239
Bach but uh 20th century composers uh

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,439
like Arnold schernberg or car hunch

86
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,879
stock Housen they've used um inversion

87
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,799
Cemetery a lot the other the other thing

88
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,680
is that things are inversions of each

89
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,600
other

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,840
um have the same um interval structure

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,560
so if you're playing with a piece and

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,120
you're thinking about oh how can I reuse

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,080
those intervals um that can uh that can

94
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:36,160
be a place that's done um I I think it's

95
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,639
um you know you can Google online people

96
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,639
singing Happy Birthday in inversion and

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,400
stuff like that so quite a number of

98
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,320
people do hear it in special cases as an

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,080
equivalence class um as we we saw with

100
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,520
the um Gustaf Holst uh example where the

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,080
sixth time through the shakon theme he

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,919
decides to play Upside Down do you

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,240
remember that from the band thing that

104
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,240
we have so that that's one of the places

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,479
that's the there um I think we've moved

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
to a world that's different from even 25

107
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,960
30 years ago where it was this notion

108
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,320
that oh eventually we're all going to

109
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,840
hear inversions uh the way we hear

110
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,840
transpositions and I think that that's

111
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,880
uh not something composers are asserting

112
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,759
as much great

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,319
question other things um there's one

114
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,919
case and I haven't run your things

115
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,199
through it that is uh interesting that

116
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,800
almost

117
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,120
all here I'll just go over here almost

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
all

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,479
musical structures that have the same

120
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,400
built on the same numbers of

121
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:48,720
intervals like once you do reduce them

122
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,520
OCT equivalent and so on such as you

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,080
know here we have a major third

124
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,560
especially if we don't care about

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:01,319
spelling and here we have a minor third

126
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:05,160
and together we have a perfect fifth

127
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:08,560
um and here we have M minor major

128
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,720
perfect fifth major Triad Minor triad uh

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,240
most cases that chords that have the

130
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,160
same interval content can be transposed

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,960
or inverted to make each other and

132
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:26,599
there's a the cool thing is there's a

133
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:31,800
very few exceptions to that uh rule um

134
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:35,319
two of the most famous one is is any

135
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,360
transposition or inversion of this um

136
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,520
I'll use pitch class numbers

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,800
01

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,120
37 so

139
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,360
that's

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
and

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,080
0

142
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,080
1

143
00:06:51,080 --> 00:07:00,680
4 terrible that's an e 4

144
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,479
6 0 1 4 6

145
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,000
um somebody while I'm getting a new pen

146
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,160
verify that those

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,639
are those have the same interval content

148
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,639
do they both have a semitone

149
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,400
somewhere yeah between the zero and the

150
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,879
one right do they both sorry you need

151
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,319
you do need that better pen before you

152
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,319
do it do they both have a whole

153
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,039
step yeah where where's the whole step

154
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,199
in the first

155
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,440
one 1 to three yep it's written this way

156
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,960
with spelling uh thing so it's a little

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,039
hard do they both have a minor

158
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,759
third do they both have a major

159
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,120
third yes this one's a little bit harder

160
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,159
yeah so two things at four there's the

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,479
major third it's a major third do they

162
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:54,319
both have um a perfect

163
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:58,120
fourth yeah and yeah where's the perfect

164
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:01,159
fourth in this ah so

165
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,240
this this one pretty easy and here the

166
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:06,879
perfect fourth is because we have octave

167
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
equivalents we just move this one up and

168
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,080
then we get a perfect

169
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,240
fourth and do they have a

170
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,720
trone augmented yeah this one's pretty

171
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,800
easy because there's a trone from the

172
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,360
lowest to highest and here it's between

173
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,319
the first and the last this one's

174
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,520
particularly interesting because any

175
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:33,479
four note chord will have six um

176
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,159
intervals in it and if we think of how

177
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,800
many how many semmit tones how many hold

178
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,800
steps how many minor thirds major thirds

179
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,719
perfect fourths trones and everything

180
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,959
else above that is just an inversion of

181
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:50,080
these uh they each have one so these are

182
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:53,120
um SI it's called the all interval Tetra

183
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,040
chords and the fascinating thing is that

184
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,440
you cannot invert one to make the other

185
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,839
there's only a few things like this and

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,839
they they're called Z

187
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,120
related nobody really knows what the Z

188
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,480
stands for um it's not a Russian

189
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
propaganda thing or whatever um so

190
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,160
they're z- related and they always come

191
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
in

192
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,560
pairs if we use a 16 tone system then

193
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,880
all the z- related things come in in

194
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,720
triples and somebody has worked out the

195
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,680
math if we use a 30 tone system they all

196
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,640
come in groups of five and stuff and

197
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,040
it's a one of these things that we that

198
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,320
those of us in the music theory have

199
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,360
never um worked with a mathematician to

200
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,160
figure out what the general pattern is

201
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,640
of where Z related um systems come okay

202
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,320
nice little side but um kind of the fun

203
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,440
things you can do uh if you're doing a

204
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,079
little bit more pure math side uh less

205
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,519
computation yeah Jake that be an

206
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:58,480
interesting final that would

207
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,560
be that would be a final project that

208
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,120
have a backup planned because do not do

209
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,519
not bet your entire grade on being able

210
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,519
to figure out but but yeah enumerating

211
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,920
um in various things and yep would be

212
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,720
great and a lot of lot of people who are

213
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,120
interested in postt music will be

214
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,680
interested in that good

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,079
okay let's move off the computer we're

216
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,399
gone from computer to math to let's go

217
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,320
to Pure music I'm going to play in a

218
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,040
second but you can get started the

219
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,000
Corral that I've passed out for you the

220
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,639
class theme Corral Allelujah Allelujah

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,079
um Corral and your job talk with other

222
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:46,639
people around this is first to spend um

223
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,560
let's spend five minutes just doing

224
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:53,320
whatever Roman num numeral or other

225
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,279
analysis you've been taught on this

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,839
project and let's not all start at the

227
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,360
beginning so that some of us can have

228
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,040
some interesting comments about the end

229
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,720
or something but just

230
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,680
pretty 5 minutes until I give more

231
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,480
instructions if you talk with each other

232
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,480
you'll make fewer

233
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,320
mistakes okay let's uh bring it back for

234
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,240
a

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,440
second everybody I'm going to start by

236
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,000
asking people for um something that they

237
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,240
found interesting let's let's um let's

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,959
let's number guys let's number our

239
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:41,839
measures so so one measure 1 2 3 4 five

240
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:45,079
six seven 8 nine did I count that right

241
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,000
um so I just so when you say if there's

242
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:51,760
something interesting in a specific

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,399
place um that I want to know it um well

244
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,160
we'll just we'll jump around a little

245
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,800
bit Jason what' you find that's

246
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,240
interesting uh I believe

247
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:07,880
the starting the end of the first uh I

248
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,519
think it's 511 and then uh 51 51 uh and

249
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,600
the following one is basically 5151 but

250
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:17,160
an minor inste oh so we have so your

251
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,079
interesting thing is that we have some

252
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,600
sort of um I don't know what do you call

253
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,199
it modulating

254
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,959
sequence

255
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,040
modulating or a repetition on different

256
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,160
keys this is the one I wanted to get rid

257
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,160
of

258
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:42,600
good uh let's see

259
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,600
uh who hasn't been calling for a while

260
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,680
Angelica it's Weir that they Choice the

261
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:55,560
exra minor because if you're looking at

262
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:59,600
an a major it's like equal to

263
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,079
maor so we're we're starting in you in a

264
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,399
major and then it goes to the what' you

265
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,760
say the when it goes to minor it's a key

266
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,720
to like go from from a major because it

267
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,519
goes between like a six and third so it

268
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,079
goes between it goes down a sixth and

269
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,560
then what then like it goes between a

270
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,240
major third and sixth chord minor six oh

271
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,399
it goes from a minor sixth chord to a

272
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,560
major sixth chord something cool great

273
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,680
super very interesting uh we'll keep

274
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,760
going

275
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,079
who hasn't been called

276
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,839
Jordan um something interesting I guess

277
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,680
is I was trying to figure out what the

278
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,920
cord was when measure two the

279
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,320
last yeah I don't know if to call that

280
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,160
yeah who who who gave a label to a chord

281
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,480
here okay good let's let's see Matthew

282
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,680
what what label did you give it 56 of

283
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:01,440
six five six of six and for those who

284
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,920
don't yet translating those numbers to

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,360
symbols in head were you thinking of

286
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,360
something

287
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,800
like okay um I can over time you do

288
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,160
learn to hear the lower cases and the

289
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,759
slashes and the and the things what's

290
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,800
what's in Roman numerals and what's in

291
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,600
Arabic uh anybody give a different thing

292
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040
for

293
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,519
that yeah I ja a question wa just let me

294
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
let's let's finish on this particular

295
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,440
question yes okay go ahead yeah so like

296
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,199
um worked from the end so um yeah I just

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,720
kind of assumed it was an F minor like

298
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,199
this was just like this 56 so this was

299
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,680
just in 56 good so I think we're getting

300
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,680
to our next question how many people um

301
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,759
noted a key change in the piece not

302
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,079
everybody got far enough to do one

303
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,839
person did two people you presumably did

304
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,160
or did not uh I mean I only got through

305
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,279
like halfway through measure three

306
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,800
that's fine that's fine good uh and

307
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,680
anybody not find key chain so John yep

308
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,839
so for those who um for those who did

309
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,920
think of a key change where did you put

310
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,519
the key change Adam between measure

311
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:20,759
seven and eight between measure seven

312
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:23,720
and8 five six 7 between here key change

313
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,440
good any other things Jason I didn't get

314
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,160
that far but it does feel like there's a

315
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,360
key change like between two and three

316
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,240
between two and three great um where

317
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,240
would we put it

318
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,319
exactly if if you are if you are buying

319
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,199
Jason

320
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:49,000
S if Adam if if you're going with

321
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,160
Jason's where would you put that in

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,079
between the two mens of that eight

323
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,079
letter word within the for second

324
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
measure third and fourth beats second

325
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,000
measure between third and fourth beat

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,480
just after the f

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,480
anybody would place it another

328
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,839
place anybody think that you know it

329
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,680
might be ambiguous and we might be um

330
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,160
kind of floating between two keys for a

331
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,560
while when we do certain key changes

332
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,480
anyone ever think that uh I would

333
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,040
there's a a type of P chord that chord

334
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,360
thing that begins with a p that some

335
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,360
people use for that yeah John piery

336
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,959
piery is is a type of cord and it does

337
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,759
apply to this piece where where do we

338
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,480
see some uh that might be a picker

339
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:39,880
D anybody picker D

340
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,720
third uh major third in a minor

341
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,440
context good the very last chord very

342
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
last chord yep think the p word you were

343
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,279
looking for is Pivot pivot yep so we

344
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,519
went with two different ones we great we

345
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,399
got two different great uh P chords

346
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,759
there yeah so pivot chords are what some

347
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,600
people use to say that oh you know that

348
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,839
this is the moment when we're in two

349
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,920
keys for a while and I remember asking

350
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,120
my teachers well can there be a pivot

351
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,760
region and one teacher said no now you

352
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,919
choose a chord and stick to it and then

353
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,439
another teacher said no no of course

354
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:15,720
there could be so um good any any um oh

355
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,160
a couple things uh for those who did do

356
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,000
the end or get to the end uh how many

357
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,400
thought we were in a major at the

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,199
end how many thought we were in F

359
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,480
major how many thought we were an F

360
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,640
minor couple

361
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,760
how many thought we were in another key

362
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,480
Al together drian no okay good that last

363
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,160
one's the only one that I wouldn't have

364
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,160
liked uh somebody who thought we were in

365
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,400
F major um explain to the F minor people

366
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,520
why they're

367
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,280
wrong yeah go ahead think well like the

368
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,000
all the aars in the last two bars are

369
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,960
indicator but also um I think we thought

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,679
that the verada measur 7 uh sounded like

371
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,960
uh like the dominant five after

372
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,600
but it end up resolving into major in

373
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,799
the next quarter which kind of for the

374
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:11,080
next okay good um couple things that I

375
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,880
heard that's always a very good um way

376
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,799
of not necessarily winning but advancing

377
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,840
an analysis argument you said it sounded

378
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,400
like good always always think and let

379
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,840
our ears do it not just what's written

380
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,080
on the paper somebody who is an F minor

381
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,280
winner um what try to convince the F

382
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,960
major people that they're wrong yeah

383
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:36,000
John quite a bit piece we hear hints a

384
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:40,799
lot at uh minor so like you have a lot

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,840
ofor cords leing to up minor so last

386
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,360
kind be seen as Bob just like kind of

387
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:51,520
stylizing things keep keeping it still

388
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:55,559
in minor so a stylization but it doesn't

389
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:59,200
change uhuh yeah so we can have a

390
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:01,320
disagreement on this um I'm not going to

391
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,600
say at this moment which side I'm more

392
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,600
on because uh I I can see the validity

393
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,480
of both sides

394
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,120
um I can't because I know the world of

395
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,760
Bach I I myself cannot really hear it as

396
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,799
oh we're still in a major and we um are

397
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,440
ending on the sixth chord and the sixth

398
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,679
chords are very important but on the

399
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,840
other hand if I listen to a lot more uh

400
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,120
contemporary popular music where six is

401
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,840
a perfectly valid chord to to begin on

402
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,720
and occasionally to end on um seemed you

403
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,480
know quite quite possible good so we

404
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,880
just spent 30 minutes looking at one

405
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,440
Coral in

406
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,360
particular um and that's not something

407
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,039
we're going to do very often in this

408
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,960
class but that is the normal way of

409
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:57,720
analyzing music right so what I um want

410
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,600
to do is to bring up the concept of why

411
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,440
what we're doing with Corpus analysis

412
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,480
which is what we're going to be doing uh

413
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,840
for most of the rest of the um of this

414
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,679
unit um so I'll just put this up for a

415
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,039
second and there's a there a way I can

416
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:17,559
blank this does that

417
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:21,520
work yep there we

418
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,360
go so we often think uh you may have

419
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,640
heard this in one of your literature

420
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,640
classes about close reading you know

421
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,880
where you're looking through in finding

422
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,840
all of Mark Twain's metaphors or all of

423
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,280
uh Jane Austin's foreshadowings and how

424
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,799
many Greek rooted words are used in this

425
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,320
sentence this paragraph compared to uh

426
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,559
the Latin words or the Anglo-Saxon ones

427
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,760
and stuff so close reading is the main

428
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:55,960
type of literary analysis um starting

429
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,080
about uh it goes back to sort of the 80s

430
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,200
but really in the last 20 years there's

431
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,840
been a movement associated with the

432
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,840
computer

433
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,039
um called distant

434
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,320
reading the other people were doing this

435
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:14,480
before but um the term is connected to a

436
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,240
literary critic named uh Franco Moretti

437
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,080
and that's not going to be on exam or

438
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,080
anything but uh so the notion is that

439
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,000
distant reading is something you do when

440
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,120
you're not close enough to the text to

441
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,200
really make these kinds of precise

442
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,080
arguments but you are far enough away

443
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,600
that you can see not just one text but

444
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,799
multiple

445
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,400
texts so uh some of us who work on

446
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,440
Corpus Studies have started in music

447
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,840
have started replacing these terms with

448
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,840
close

449
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,120
listening which is conventional music

450
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
analysis

451
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,440
and distant

452
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,760
listening which is Corpus

453
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,880
studies

454
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,840
um

455
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,360
what what do you think some of the

456
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:28,520
things that we can do with close reading

457
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,000
or close listening better close anal

458
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,880
analysis whatever you want to call it

459
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,880
better than distant

460
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,000
analysis yeah CL analysis we can't look

461
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,760
for specific phrases motiv specific

462
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,760
phrases or motifs

463
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:59,000
yep anything else you

464
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,000
think and let's let's think of sort of

465
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,679
the world we're in today not not the

466
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,279
world of of 5,000 years in the future or

467
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,799
maybe 5 minutes depending on what

468
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:11,120
happened at open a today but um you know

469
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,960
where the computer can do many things it

470
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,600
can't do

471
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,360
but what are some things that we that

472
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,360
we're going to start

473
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:29,159
losing yeah yeah what makes distance

474
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,880
dist listening different mean because

475
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,480
like in a corporate study can study

476
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,559
everything

477
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,240
close sure so let's let's let's think of

478
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,159
some of the things um let's think of

479
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,039
some of the things we we'll go back to

480
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,559
literature Stu what are some of the

481
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,840
things that humans are good at in

482
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:51,679
picking out of literature that computers

483
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,799
are still not very good ATA um like more

484
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,840
abstract like we can be like oh this is

485
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,720
an illusion like Shakespeare so similar

486
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,880
like we can like notice patterns that

487
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,480
like are hard to really yeah condense

488
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,080
into like one formula function can be

489
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,880
like oh this like is a similar Melody to

490
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,880
like something that was us previous um

491
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,799
so that's a good one other things what

492
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,679
about for you um let's let's let's start

493
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,480
with some one that that's hot in my head

494
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,840
but I really want to make sure we don't

495
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,440
lose track of this um anyone have a

496
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,360
piece of music they

497
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,559
love okay almost everybody good good

498
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,840
good how did you fall in love with that

499
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,120
piece of

500
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,000
music um listening to it listening to it

501
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,240
good how many people have fallen in love

502
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
with a piece of music via Corpus

503
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:49,720
studies via o ooh this one has 47% of

504
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:54,159
Sharps and so let's let's not forget

505
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:58,159
that the reason why we make music and

506
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,840
listen to it is the enjoyment happens at

507
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,240
the a close

508
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,799
level um the other thing I was thinking

509
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,720
of with the literature is this character

510
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm writing um reading crying in Hmart

511
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,120
right now I don't know if anyone knows

512
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,480
this Memoir but the car one of the

513
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,520
characters in it is going through a very

514
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,320
similar experience that I went through

515
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,120
in my life um with the family death and

516
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,799
it was very deeply resonating with me so

517
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,000
um

518
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,640
resonance outside your

519
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,159
life or outside not outside your life I

520
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,120
can't really outside my life outside the

521
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,000
text and we'll use text to mean both

522
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,159
literature and

523
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,120
music um so there are some what are some

524
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,799
things that however that distant

525
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,679
listening or distant reading that is to

526
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:57,120
say having a computer look at a thousand

527
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,200
pieces might do better than close than

528
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,200
close re let's first first assume we

529
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,600
have infinite time then close reading a

530
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,600
th

531
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,880
pieces yeah it can allow you to more

532
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
effectively when listening to a new

533
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,600
piece guess who the composer was or what

534
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,520
the time period was

535
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,320
okay so you could use that yeah distance

536
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:28,559
for

537
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,840
guessing uh genre or period

538
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,840
or

539
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,919
authorship you might be able to do that

540
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,760
with the Thousand scores but that would

541
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,520
take a long lot longer good what are

542
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,360
other things we want to solve yeah I

543
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,399
think you could do like a less abstract

544
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,039
way of describing any patterns you might

545
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:48,960
hear it's like easy to say something

546
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,640
sounds similar but actually analyzing it

547
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:58,600
gives you words to put that into uh so

548
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:01,919
it gives you words for describing gives

549
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,919
words for describing

550
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,000
similarity

551
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,360
and what else besides words for

552
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,720
describing similarity what are some

553
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,520
other things that we like to get out of

554
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,840
this

555
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,840
class yeah numbers numbers numbers

556
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,679
statistics so this these are some of the

557
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,399
reasons why um I want to be thinking

558
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,720
this but

559
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:34,919
I think I I'll just say because I'm me a

560
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,279
couple minutes behind where like to be

561
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:41,120
that the most

562
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:46,120
effective way of working with any sort

563
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,840
of new genre new style new anything is

564
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,240
to start with close listening close

565
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,960
reading start with the analysis that

566
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,320
you've done now and try to do things by

567
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,240
hand before moving to the programming

568
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,799
how are we going to do distant listening

569
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
how are we going to do teach the

570
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,600
computer to do this because there's

571
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,679
something oh that didn't come up that

572
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,120
the ambiguity and the the types of um

573
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
sort of oh I'm going to have to make a

574
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,279
judgment call on this on where the

575
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,360
modulation happened or is this really um

576
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:24,039
five six of six or did we already jump

577
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,600
directly to the new key or um is this

578
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,519
thing that I'm labeling actually a cord

579
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,760
at all or is a whole bunch of passing

580
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,240
tones that happen to look like a chord

581
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,760
these kinds of ambiguities are things

582
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,760
that will

583
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,159
um that I think will come up when you're

584
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,320
doing the close listening close

585
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,799
analysis and that you'll know you have

586
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,519
to account for them in some way during

587
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,360
the distant analysis and sometimes

588
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,640
accounting for them in some way is just

589
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,640
leaving a footnote saying there's this

590
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,000
really complex problem but I only saw it

591
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,679
twice in close listening to four pieces

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,320
so hopefully we can ignore it as a

593
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,840
rounding error but at least declaring

594
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,519
that then when you've done your Corpus

595
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,559
study there's something really valuable

596
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,600
about finding things that are

597
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,760
interesting there right what's that

598
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,480
piece that

599
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,200
completely throws that outlier piece

600
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,519
this completely throws out and going

601
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,840
back and listening to it maybe it

602
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,720
doesn't even have to be close listing

603
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,559
but actually just human listing so that

604
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,080
we get what's the end result why why we

605
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,080
do any of

606
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,799
this so we can get to the enjoyment the

607
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,399
point of trying to do one of my dream

608
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,480
projects you you all have heard of imslp

609
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:50,399
huge seat music score I want to find the

610
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,519
most interesting unusual piece by every

611
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,039
minor composer that's on there that has

612
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,880
the thing the one piece that this one

613
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:01,360
forgotten person that that she or he

614
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
wrote that we that we should actually be

615
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,679
listening to maybe it's not even the one

616
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,399
piece this 13 second excerpt that uh

617
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:14,519
grower wrote that I don't know and I'd

618
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,200
love to know it uh we're not there yet

619
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:21,480
not there yet but maybe we can get

620
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,640
there great um

621
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,120
so the next thing you're going to be

622
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,519
doing is trying to figure out what kinds

623
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,799
of things we can do this kind of close

624
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,840
analysis on we did the Irish music

625
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,039
Corpus uh in class on on Wednesday that

626
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,440
was a pretty small Corpus what 60 pieces

627
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,600
or something um then online I gave you

628
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,120
tools for using the entire Bach Corral

629
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,159
Corpus so if you want to find uh

630
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,720
anything super unusual in there that can

631
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,600
be a good

632
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,279
place but be boring if those are the

633
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,480
only two ones so your next problem set

634
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,639
and it's up is problem set five and let

635
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:05,880
me put this back up

636
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:08,720
here so this one um we want to do is in

637
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,600
groups of two prepare three to five page

638
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,480
short paper three pages is except is

639
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,320
totally fine five pages sometimes is you

640
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,639
know might be something you want to do

641
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,000
that tries to figure out some Corpus

642
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:27,919
that's out there that's been active in

643
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:32,960
the past 10 years and um try to figure

644
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,360
figure out um how it works so and why

645
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,639
it's out there and what its extent is so

646
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,519
what are the goals of the project who

647
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,679
are the

648
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,320
participants how are the scores or other

649
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,639
musical data encoded I think I've

650
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,440
forgotten to put on here uh what's

651
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:48,360
actually in there what's the project

652
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,519
actually trying to do I suppose that's

653
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,760
the goal of the project um but what

654
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,480
pieces are collected what is the overall

655
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,679
extent of the problem there is what's it

656
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,559
trying to solve and how much by doing

657
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,360
this and how much of the problem do you

658
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,360
think could be reasonably solved in a

659
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,480
limited

660
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,360
timetable you don't have to do all of

661
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,039
these except for the first one and we'll

662
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,120
get to the last one um what are the

663
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:15,480
strengths and weaknesses and what could

664
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:19,039
you do with the scorpus what questions

665
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:23,039
relevant to this class could you answer

666
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,440
by having this um just like we did with

667
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,559
the uh what questions could you answer

668
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,279
with a whole collection of Bach Corrals

669
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,760
on um was that piece at one or or three

670
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,000
or something like that um you don't need

671
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,559
to use the Corpus to answer it they're

672
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,120
not being asked to download and do the

673
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,519
things but um anyhow uh you'll probably

674
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,440
need to know a little bit about the

675
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,639
kinds of music and the problems

676
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,159
associated with the project and what

677
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:52,840
they're trying to do and my preference

678
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:55,600
is that you focus on a corpus of musical

679
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,960
scores sorry it's too high up there um

680
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,559
scores that can be readable by music 21

681
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,720
or something else but if something

682
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,960
really grabs you and you're like this

683
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,840
this is the music I really like and it's

684
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,600
all audio it's all images or something

685
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,600
like that uh go ahead and do that just

686
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,720
um the only two things I'm going to say

687
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,639
imslp and Wikipedia are out uh too

688
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,840
obvious right I've given some places

689
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:21,399
that you can

690
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,960
begin some of them I was nice enough to

691
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,559
give the links and other ones I'm like n

692
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,720
um and then some directories of

693
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,519
projects and

694
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,760
um and how what you're going to be asked

695
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,240
for URLs screenshots uh how many How

696
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,039
Deeply the questions you were answered

697
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,440
so um hope that you'll find this kind of

698
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:49,159
fun it's due in a week I what I want to

699
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,279
do is give you now um 10 minutes to um

700
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,440
find the person that you want to do this

701
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,279
work with the only caveat is you cannot

702
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,600
have been in the same pet to group

703
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,919
that's just because um you know when we

704
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,679
do a lot of group work and you have

705
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,360
group grades I want to make sure that

706
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,679
you're um getting uh things from you and

707
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,159
so we rotate that around and um start

708
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,320
talking about what potential types of

709
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,720
things you've seen or um done this is a

710
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,560
good time to Google and mess around on

711
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,639
the internet in class with your

712
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,399
professor's um blessing couple things

713
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,320
going on here that just want to make

714
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,960
sure that we get to we're doing these

715
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,280
big topics uh um you know Corpus studies

716
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,280
representation intervals and stuff like

717
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,240
that but then along the way there's a

718
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,359
bunch of little things that will make

719
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,240
your life easier that you know like

720
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:43,079
eventually you'll need to know how to

721
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,879
deal with cs and stuff so I'm um make

722
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,639
sure if you haven't been reading through

723
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,119
parts of the music 21 users guide that

724
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,639
you um that you continue to do that and

725
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,359
that this is a place when you want to

726
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,880
know something um there is the users's

727
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,240
guide and the complete reference the

728
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,839
complete reference doesn't really

729
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,520
distinguish between what is uh important

730
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,880
and what isn't whereas uh hopefully

731
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,119
we've done a decent job explaining that

732
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,359
you've should have by now read through

733
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:17,480
up to um up to chapter six here if you

734
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,800
haven't uh most MIT students probably

735
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,880
won't need to go through chapter five on

736
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,480
uh recursion and lists of lists if

737
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,320
you're in this but um we've skipped

738
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,040
chords and sign called cify for a bit um

739
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,839
I think you can uh well we'll get to

740
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,240
that later um but definitely start

741
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:41,920
reading through um the music 21 object

742
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,440
thing what is a music 21 object you'll

743
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,040
see durations are not music 21 objects

744
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:51,040
so not everything that's in music 21 is

745
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,480
one um and basically the easiest

746
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,520
definition is a music 21 object is

747
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,160
something that can go into a stream it

748
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,640
knows how to position itself and it has

749
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,280
a duration and um some other things so

750
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,599
want to go through um this at some point

751
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,760
just to that when I'm giving an

752
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,680
assignment um everything's unlocked here

753
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,200
how you can give um who who has worked

754
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,480
with JavaScript um Dom manipulation like

755
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,480
get Elements by class so so quite a PE

756
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,599
number of people have tried to make

757
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,920
music 21 to be a lot like the version of

758
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:31,440
JavaScript that was around at the time

759
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:34,680
in um 20 whenever it was 2006 2007 so

760
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,440
there's things like get element by ID um

761
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,760
get Elements by group group is

762
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,359
equivalent in music 21 to um JavaScript

763
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,000
uh class the class so multiple thing the

764
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:50,760
dot selector so multiple things can be

765
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,119
in the same group and

766
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,560
um so on and then um there's a nice

767
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,920
little discussion of the thing that will

768
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,160
that will probably drive you baffling

769
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,280
baffled um at some point the active site

770
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,720
which is telling you which stream is and

771
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,480
we uh still haven't figured out who um

772
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,599
that one bug that we saw in class with

773
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,160
the active site being wrong or the get

774
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,599
context by class being wrong so this

775
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,960
chapter um just goes through the basic

776
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:22,440
things and um it will tell you how to

777
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,800
sort objects which will sometimes be

778
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,440
useful how to move two things are at the

779
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:33,319
same place and what sorting is

780
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,839
uh the next chapter uh has um a little

781
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,560
bit of the details on how things work

782
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,520
how you can transpose a note and how you

783
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,800
can get back from the transpose note to

784
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,520
its original note and so on except

785
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,000
you're not a yeah I think transpose is

786
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,920
about to be unlocked for you right

787
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,920
because you've just done all of this um

788
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,359
work and um a bunch of other little

789
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,560
things but that's kind of a little bit

790
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,880
boring one so read through that read

791
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,760
through the time signatures and beats

792
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,760
and the keys and key signatures uh this

793
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,400
last one lets you do your first little

794
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,880
algorithmic composition uh exercise

795
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,880
where

796
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,880
um toward the very end sorry scrolling

797
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:25,640
fast um here we go where we can create a

798
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:30,760
little Melody something like this

799
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:33,960
and automatically change it and have um

800
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,560
I don't know why SI this goes

801
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,960
um have a piece of music that I remember

802
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,359
having to play a lot in junior

803
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,359
high and so

804
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,400
on so it's nice to make little

805
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,240
algorithmic pieces um before we write

806
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,720
our first um true algorithmic

807
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,560
composition for um W problem set

808
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,599
8 so uh those are some of the things

809
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,280
that you've probably been looking at

810
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,800
also optionally might want to go through

811
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,640
CS articulations and ornaments and we'll

812
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,079
do a little bit of that right now we're

813
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,400
not going to get um time to get to

814
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,000
intervals right now um okay so let's but

815
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,359
let's let's play with a little bit so if

816
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,040
you have a second and you have your

817
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,680
laptop out and uh if you have Jupiter

818
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,960
able to be got up sorry I should have

819
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,920
should have said that 5 minutes ago like

820
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,079
always um you know like the way the

821
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,000
conductor says I want you to play a

822
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,000
little bit louder and and make sure

823
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,400
speciically separate all the notes of 32

824
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,800
measures after a right you know the

825
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,720
worst worst order um yeah so sorry sorry

826
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,240
about that that's just me vamping while

827
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:49,440
we give this chance to

828
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:51,480
um who who cannot see a Jupiter notebook

829
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,280
that's that's on or I suppose you can

830
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:58,480
all see mine so um given the time with

831
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:03,800
10 minutes let's um do a little bit of

832
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:06,280
um more work on um on things you can so

833
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:10,880
I'm going to import Corpus stream note

834
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:13,839
meter and we're going to look at um a

835
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,480
couple other little uh things in a piece

836
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,760
by ysep heyen so Corpus parse I'm going

837
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:25,319
to assign it to heyen

838
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:28,160
heyen Opus One Number One movement

839
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:31,480
one so that's than give everybody a

840
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,280
chance to do it and you can show it when

841
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,280
you're

842
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,960
ready this is the first string quartet

843
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,480
that heyen ever published um pretty

844
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,440
young there was mostly an old man

845
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,800
thought of as a sort of old man

846
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,280
composer and start with our um close

847
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,839
listening for even just a few seconds um

848
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,319
until while I grab the recording of this

849
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,960
um what's interesting about the opening

850
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,960
to

851
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:14,960
anybody

852
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,630
joh it's all in

853
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,630
[Music]

854
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,640
unison do we hear that's all in un

855
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,400
I didn't give you the second page

856
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:45,200
because I did it in the notebook just

857
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:49,880
remember you can always um show hien

858
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:53,480
show U music xml. PDF to get it or just

859
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:58,000
um to get the whole thing up okay so

860
00:41:53,480 --> 00:42:00,520
it's all in unison at the beginning um

861
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,319
we're not going to do another um thing

862
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,920
like we did with trying to figure out

863
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,480
you what are the where are the notes

864
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,160
outside the key uh and so on but go

865
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,280
ahead and tell me how many how many

866
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,200
notes are there in this

867
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,640
piece so when you've got it I'm not

868
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,839
going to not going to call on the first

869
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,920
person shout out so but let's make just

870
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:25,280
be sure we can still do something like

871
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,559
that so what what is the question that

872
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,240
we're trying to do somebody how many

873
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,760
notes are there how many notes are there

874
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:38,119
in this piece so

875
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:41,800
um what uh who haven't who hasn't been

876
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,079
called on very much check you haven't

877
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,800
called on usually I pick on you too much

878
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,440
what what what um what did you do on

879
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,720
your thing let's I'm assume you started

880
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,359
with hien do something uh I four okay

881
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,160
good

882
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:03,640
and and then in no do and I

883
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:07,720
counted no do cter counter

884
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:12,119
good I equals 0 right I plus equals 1

885
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,079
and then I good anyone so we use the

886
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:19,160
what kind of what kind of iteration does

887
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:22,000
this do recurse recurse good

888
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,599
so somebody get that number that's good

889
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,800
I saw a lot of fours in the middle there

890
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,599
um what's another way we could do this

891
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,359
somebody have a different way yeah um

892
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,599
hi.

893
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:37,599
rec. hien do

894
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:45,400
recurse doget elements by

895
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:50,200
class note. note and

896
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,559
then link like yep yeah it's when you

897
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,960
it's when you forget to put that at the

898
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:54,559
beginning that you really wish python

899
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,599
were more like JavaScript or Java where

900
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,640
you could just do length at the end but

901
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:03,800
yep good any other ways that people

902
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,839
did okay enough enough note counting U

903
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:11,880
by the way you hope

904
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:16,680
that um that this should um

905
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:19,520
Len also get something pretty similar so

906
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,920
flattening it doesn't matter which order

907
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,400
you're iterating through you're still

908
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:28,040
going to hit every single thing right

909
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:31,160
good um okay so let's grab the viola

910
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:34,160
part I'm going to call it vaa equals and

911
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,000
take the second to see if you can

912
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,000
remember how to do

913
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,880
that and what the question is going to

914
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,440
be uh this will be one of the last

915
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,880
second to last thing uh get the viart

916
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:51,200
and let's change its cff to uh trouble

917
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:55,599
cff because um a little bit harder for

918
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,599
us to read who are not vists

919
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,760
you might need to um from music 21

920
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,760
import cff I can't

921
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:20,920
remember has everyone gotten the raise

922
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,480
your hand if you've gotten the viola

923
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,680
part out even if you not get CL good

924
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,599
good okay so I'm going to put in what I

925
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,839
did um to get that

926
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:34,520
hidden. Parts Viola notice it's not case

927
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:36,640
sensitive and let me just make sure I

928
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,599
got the right

929
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,680
one you could also have done

930
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:47,160
index one two three two right good so

931
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:51,520
keep going on that so I'm going to go

932
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:55,440
through a couple ways I did it Viola um

933
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,760
we call it Alto CL hopefully it's that

934
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,359
equals what viola

935
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,440
cf.

936
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:07,599
cf. first hopefully that's

937
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:12,640
right or Viola recurse doget Elements by

938
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:15,280
class clef whatever so um and do this

939
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,839
one here's one of the ways that you

940
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,480
could do that I'll I'll just give the uh

941
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:24,119
EAS the way that's probably not the best

942
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,160
way but looking at the time um I'll

943
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,200
explain the best way later we can put it

944
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,440
as a g two cluff we're going to change

945
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,440
it and

946
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,440
um piece should be beginning with a

947
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:38,839
bunch of B

948
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,800
flats and it still is so that's one way

949
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:44,040
to do it I want to just point out two

950
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,640
things um here notice we did not change

951
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,400
the stem directions of anything so it

952
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,359
looks a little bit weird it looks very

953
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,480
weird when you go from treble cluff to

954
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:55,440
base cluff or something like that the

955
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,040
other thing is uh what do you call it

956
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,599
Alto C

957
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:04,200
that now we we have a particular

958
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:07,119
subclass of clefs so that clefs are in a

959
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,160
taxonic or Alto cluff is in a taxonomy

960
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:14,480
or morony with a generic

961
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,079
cff taom Alto is another cff great so we

962
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,599
might be having a problem we might need

963
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,079
to see if there's a way we can actually

964
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,160
replace it with another cff thank you I

965
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,839
did broke my promise your 20 seconds

966
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:29,880
late so um thanks great

967
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,880
class e
