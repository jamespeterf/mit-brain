1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,759
Welcome to Nanosummit 2025. Uh my name

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,920
is Vladimir Bulovich. I have a privilege

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,000
to work at MIT Nano and I'm just

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,000
absolutely thrilled uh to see room

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
filled with students, faculty,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,560
researchers, our corporate partners,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
other entrepreneurs. I mean, this is an

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,160
incredible opportunity for us to tell

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,000
you of the multitudes of ways MIT Nano

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,040
is changing the way we think about the

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,320
future and what it's going to deliver.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,800
Indeed, your presence is shows the

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,800
uniqueness of the community that MIT

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Nano is built to serve. And hence, I'm

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,520
absolutely overjoyed to show you

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,199
throughout the day various ways MIT Nano

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
indeed intends to change the world

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,079
through your work and the opportunities

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,080
that you'll bring for everyone.

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,040
2025 marks the seventh year of MIT Nano.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,840
When MIT first imagined building MIT

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
Nano, the goal was not just to create

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
new labs or acquire the best tools and

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,840
instruments. Uh the vision was much

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,560
bigger. It was to create a way a

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,520
catalyst for discovery. A place where

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,240
ideas and disciplines meet, where

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,240
conversations happen across the fields,

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,560
and where discoveries at the smallest

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,119
scale can grow into solutions with

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,640
global impact.

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,479
When MIT Nano opened in uh 2018, it

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,920
represented a bold investment in the

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,040
future of science and engineering at

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,680
MIT. Uh since then, the facility has

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,680
matured into a thriving community of

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,680
users.

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,920
The uh at this point uh we have over

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,600
1,500

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,399
annual users at MIT Nano Drone from over

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,399
300 different PI labs across the campus

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,960
and beyond.

43
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
You know what anchors us is not just the

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
200

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
plus tools but the people who use them

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
teach with them and push the instruments

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,080
to reveal the next great breakthroughs.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,319
I often say MIT's two most important

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
deliveries to the world are our

50
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,080
knowledge and our people.

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,760
At MIT Nano both those circulate freely.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,720
Students, faculty, and researchers

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,040
exchange insights, test ideas, and build

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,360
on each other's work in hopes of leaving

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,560
this place and the world better than

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
when they arrived. And last seven years

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
tell us that they keep continually

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
succeeding.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,720
At MIT Nano, curiosity meets the

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,120
capability. Experiments generate

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,680
knowledge, expand understanding, and

62
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,239
provide the foundation for innovations

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,440
that have an impact across all different

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
disciplines. We have over 50 different

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,599
departments, labs, and centers that

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
utilize the MIT Nano. We were hoping for

67
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,920
that when we started. The fact that we

68
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
can now count it and actually recognize

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,760
the delivery of it indeed is

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,800
overwhelming.

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,360
Roughly 21% of MIT faculty touch MIT

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,360
Nano to get their work done. In seven

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
years of existence, that's quite a

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,840
growth. Annually, we keep adding about

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,519
20% of the user base. And so at some

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
point, couple of years from now, we'll

77
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,040
be talking about 2,000 users and not

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,200
just from MIT. About 20% of them come

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,480
from the external world that needs our

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,760
tools to make their discoveries happen.

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,920
We are a community, a community centered

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,680
at MIT, but the one that is here to

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,560
benefit the region and the nation.

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,319
Within MIT Nano, there are facilities

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,040
that open different windows into

86
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,799
innovation. Fab.no

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,159
gives researchers the ability to

88
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,319
fabricate um at the smallest scale,

89
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,439
transforming bold concepts into tangible

90
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,200
structures. Characterization.no

91
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,879
lets us look at materials with

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,439
extraordinary precision, revealing

93
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,160
properties that guide new breakthroughs.

94
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,840
And the immersion lab uh offers an

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,079
entirely different perspective, one

96
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,800
where technology and human experience

97
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,360
intersect, expanding how discoveries can

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,759
be applied in the world.

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,960
our programs. Well, we have many of

100
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,560
them. Here are just three to mention.

101
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,560
MIT Nano has created pathways that carry

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,919
knowledge and creativity beyond the lab.

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,160
For example, in star.no, uh we support

104
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,919
high-tech entrepreneurs as they take the

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
first step toward building companies

106
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,080
that can scale. And if you're here

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,639
yesterday afternoon, we held our very

108
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,280
first pitch.no Nano competition where a

109
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,960
dozen startups dazzled those who

110
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
participated.

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,040
Lifting up actually the exposition of

112
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
what is it to present new science and

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,520
technology.

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,240
Studio Nano fosters new ways of

115
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,199
communicating ideas helping researchers

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,039
connect with wider audiences. Our

117
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,280
collaboration with technological demon

118
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,120
builds bridges across borders

119
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,199
strengthening global networks of talent

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,840
and innovation. And so each of these

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,240
programs really extends our reach. We

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,080
have a well functioning facility. We

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,479
have an opportunity to within that

124
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
facility to bring tremendous number of

125
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,360
brilliant people. Next thing we need to

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,520
do is beyond the tools offer them ways

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,160
to engage through these programs.

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,880
The same spirit of bold collaboration

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,600
and curiosity shaped the sessions you're

130
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,600
going to hear today. We designed the

131
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
program you're going to experience today

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
to reflect some of MIT's strategic

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
priorities as outlined by our president

134
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,320
of MIT, Syornbluth.

135
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,479
The challenges the institute has

136
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,639
identified as most urgent for humanity

137
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,199
are the areas with nanocience has the

138
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,600
powerful role to play. After all, the

139
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,600
world is built from atoms up and we know

140
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
how to make every one of them exactly

141
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
where it needs to be.

142
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,400
You'll hear sessions on health and life

143
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,639
sciences to start us off. Nano provides

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,280
the tools, sensors, interfaces, and

145
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
delivery systems to transform how we

146
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,560
diagnose, treat, and even prevent new

147
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,039
types of diseases.

148
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Manufacturing. Well, breakthroughs only

149
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
matter if we can scale them. So the

150
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,280
session will explore how breakthroughs

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,520
in nano can translate into real world

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,639
products and reliable systems that can

153
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
change entire industries on climate and

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,600
sustainability. Well, from clean energy

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
to carbon capture to resilient

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,639
infrastructure, nanoscale materials and

157
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,800
devices are central to our response to

158
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,039
the climate crisis.

159
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,759
We then follow these three sessions with

160
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,240
student talks and our researcher talks.

161
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,039
talks so-called picot talks from inside

162
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,520
the lab led by the people who guide the

163
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,440
students through the lab Anna Osherov

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
and York Scholvin

165
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
in celebration of MIT's culture of

166
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,720
discovery in education this session

167
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,639
highlights some early stage ideas and

168
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
researchers whose perspectives are

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,639
essential to shaping that future.

170
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,520
We will close this afternoon uh with a

171
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,360
session uh led by president emeritus

172
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,880
Rafael Refe who will tell us about

173
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
visionaries of nanocience and

174
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,319
nanotechnology that got us to today.

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
These are people whose creativity,

176
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,960
leadership and persistence have built

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
the foundation on which we all stand on

178
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
today.

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,639
Recognizing them is a reminder that

180
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,280
progress depends not just on tools or

181
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,160
facilities but on human imagination and

182
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,000
willingness to pursue bold ideas. As a

183
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,800
matter of fact, beyond the session of

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,720
celebrating the luminaries of time past,

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,759
we are going to name a space in MIT nano

186
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360
after one of those luminaries. Please

187
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
make sure you attend the session and

188
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,240
you'll find out a lot more and then

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,440
we'll celebrate at MIT Nano.

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,680
So, as you move through the day, I

191
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,599
invite you to think big and stay

192
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,639
curious. And any questions that make you

193
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,520
want to ask speakers, please uh make

194
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,680
sure you ask them. Share a problem you

195
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,880
can't yet solve and see who in the room

196
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,800
lights up at the same thought.

197
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Some of the most important discoveries

198
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,800
emerge when someone with one set of

199
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,680
expertise brings a different perspective

200
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,480
to another. That human friction leads to

201
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,040
innovation. Let's make sure today we

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,240
have plenty of it as we challenge each

203
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,000
other and inspire each other with new

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,519
ways of thinking.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,040
MIT Nano is proof that when people from

206
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,399
different discipline share tools, spaces

207
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,320
and ideas, they discover new pathways

208
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,600
forward. We are a facility where talent

209
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,760
and knowledge meet opportunity, where a

210
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
sketch on a whiteboard can become a

211
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,519
measurement, a prototype, and eventually

212
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,279
a solution that impacts all of us.

213
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,080
So, thank you for being here today, for

214
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,720
contributing your ideas and for helping

215
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,480
us imagine and build the future

216
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
together.

217
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,320
I now have a distinct honor and a

218
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,760
privilege. One, to open the 2025 Nano

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,959
Summit and two, to welcome on the stage

220
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,360
our MIT president and remarkable leader,

221
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,360
Sel Cornbluth.

222
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,440
Well, thanks so much Vladimir uh for the

223
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,080
introduction and for your outstanding

224
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,800
leadership of making MIT Nano such a

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,040
vital part of the institute landscape. I

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,360
mean the physical landscape of course

227
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,640
200,000 square feet that allows for

228
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,560
impressive talent but also your huge

229
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,519
contributions to the landscape here of

230
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,200
ideas and exploration that really helps

231
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,000
make MIT MIT. So MIT Nano obviously

232
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,839
started before my time at MIT, but I

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,720
know that it was designed to be a

234
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,040
fantastic toolbox for this community or

235
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,839
as Vladimir describes it, a gathering

236
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,959
space that doesn't do all but enables

237
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,920
all. Now, for my part, I can't tell you

238
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,839
how excited I am that MIT Nano is

239
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,880
essential to making progress to high

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,000
priority areas where I believe that MIT

241
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,320
has a responsibility to lead. areas

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,519
where if we harness our collective

243
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,880
efforts, we can make a serious positive

244
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,040
impact. First, it's pretty fantastic.

245
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,600
Just as we're renewing our focus on

246
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,720
helping the nation regain strength in

247
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,959
manufacturing, MIT Nano is helping us

248
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,440
expand our industry partnerships,

249
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,079
explore pioneering approaches, and

250
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,160
importantly train our students in

251
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,200
everything from fabrication,

252
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,680
computational modeling, 3D printing, and

253
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,440
how to work successfully as part of a

254
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,079
team. And it's especially exciting that

255
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,320
MIT Nano is imagining new fields that

256
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,120
will shape the future of manufacturing

257
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,920
and helping young companies advance the

258
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,800
most promising technologies and then

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,600
develop them to scale. Now, with MIT

260
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,000
Heels launched last year, I'm focused on

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,519
bringing MIT experts and leaders in

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,240
biotech, pharma, and hospitals together,

263
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,880
making sure that they have the resources

264
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,959
and the infrastructure they need to

265
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,200
accelerate health care for patients

266
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,000
around the world. And they collaborate

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,360
on new knowledge, new tools, new cures.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,240
And MIT Nano allows them a place to work

269
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,079
on diagnostics and therapeutics that

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,800
range from lipid nanop particles to

271
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,920
wearable sensors to a pill that releases

272
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,279
bacteria into the GI tract to treat and

273
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,600
diagnose disease and from human health

274
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,920
to the health of the planet. I'm sure

275
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,880
you know that MIT has begun an ambitious

276
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,920
push to accelerate climate solutions and

277
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,399
despite strong headwinds and reductions

278
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,920
in federal support, we are continuing

279
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,480
that work. The intersection of climate

280
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,279
and nanotechnology is sparking all kinds

281
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,600
of ideas like new and improved materials

282
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,079
that produce fewer emissions and remove

283
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,079
pollutants from the air and nanopores

284
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,720
that monitor environmental conditions in

285
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,440
the air, water, and soil. and new

286
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,920
methods of capturing carbon dioxide and

287
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
then turning that into useful products

288
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,040
and even plants that can store that can

289
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,079
turn their own stored chemical energy

290
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,760
into visible light for human use. This

291
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,399
almost sounds like science fiction, but

292
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,399
it's incredible. And all of this is just

293
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,200
scratching the surface of the nano

294
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,519
enabled research in manufacturing, in

295
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,160
climate, in life sciences and health

296
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,519
happening all across MIT along with

297
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,200
innovation in other key areas from AI to

298
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,760
quantum. And you're going to be hearing

299
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,279
a lot more about quantum uh at MIT in

300
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,880
the coming year. MIT Nano has truly set

301
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,440
itself apart in the institute's

302
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,959
signature way with an emphasis on

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,839
crossdisciplinary collaboration and open

304
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,160
access welcoming anyone who requires

305
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,000
nano tools to make things and then scale

306
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,399
up the things they make and you know as

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,720
Vlad showed the number of users is just

308
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
continuing to increase and here's

309
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
something I find truly heartening for

310
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,079
all of us who value science both

311
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,480
fundamental and applied even with the

312
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,880
advance nano tools. We now have

313
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,360
literally at our fingertips. We're still

314
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,399
acting on the same human instinct, the

315
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,040
same curiosity we have, the drive to

316
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,519
make things, to understand how they work

317
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,000
and how to make them work for us in new

318
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,160
and exciting ways. Now, I know you want

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,560
to hear from all the amazing speakers,

320
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,040
but before I go, let me tell you one

321
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,519
more thing about MIT MIT Nano that's

322
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,920
music to my ears, and Vladimir mentioned

323
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,040
it. This is really a fantastic training

324
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,199
ground for our students. Now, 40% or so

325
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,519
of students, even more actually, major

326
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,680
in computer science, but I've been told

327
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,480
by a reliable authority that when

328
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,680
students have the opportunity to work at

329
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,680
nanocale early in their MIT careers, a

330
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
significant number actually consider

331
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,399
majoring in something else. Now, I'm

332
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,279
not, you know,

333
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,000
I am not dissing course six, believe me.

334
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,000
Um but it's no surprise that MIT

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,800
students who spend so much time in their

336
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,240
lives interacting with digital system

337
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,360
often find making things using nano

338
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
tools deeply deeply satisfying. It's a

339
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,000
reason that so many MIT students are

340
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,040
drawn here in the first place. A love of

341
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,199
making things that matter and an impulse

342
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,079
to seek seek out the company of other

343
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,360
people who share that passion. Now today

344
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,040
you're going to hear from all kinds of

345
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,519
makers, faculty and researchers,

346
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,519
students and postocs, entrepreneurs and

347
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,079
industry leaders about the

348
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,800
transformative impact of nanocience and

349
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,279
nanotechnology and how working with the

350
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,920
very small can help us do big things for

351
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,680
the world together. Now finally I'll say

352
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,279
one thing. So, I have this uh I have two

353
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,720
dogs and I have this little dog called

354
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,199
Pico. And I was very I was very uh

355
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,480
appreciative to get a 10 to the minus12

356
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,160
t-shirt because they uh but but had I

357
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,120
known I was coming to MIT, I would have

358
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,199
named him Nano. So,

359
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,040
anyway, I want to thank you uh for being

360
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,040
here and I hope you all enjoy the day.
