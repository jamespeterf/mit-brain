1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
Hello, good morning, good afternoon.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,800
Hope everyone's doing well. Welcome back

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,039
to 61200.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,760
Um, today we are going to be talking

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,160
more about proofs. Um, we spent all of

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,880
last lecture going through twothirds of

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,199
our definition of a mathematical proof.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,800
Um and the last term we haven't talked

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,800
about yet uh is logical deductions.

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,879
So we said that mathematical proofs are

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,719
built from are verifications of

12
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,399
propositions. We talked a lot about what

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,719
propositions are um using a sequence of

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,559
logical deductions starting from a base

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,800
set of axioms and we talked about what

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,879
axioms are. So finally we get to talk

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,680
about logical deductions. This is going

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,559
to be the heart of how we build and

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
construct and check our proofs. Um, so

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,200
this is where most of the proofing

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,960
happens inside of our proofs. Um, so

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,840
what is a logical deduction? Let's see.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,840
So an inference rule,

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,320
let's see,

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,320
is a rule for combining

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,320
true propositions

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,040
to form

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,040
other true propositions.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,880
For example, one of the classic ones and

30
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,240
one we've um we've talked about uh

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,240
briefly is called modus ponins.

32
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,119
And I'm writing this just to say let's

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,479
not ever use those words again. Um the

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:07,880
the concept is um is intuitive enough.

35
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,880
If we know P and we know P implies Q.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,239
If we know these

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,800
then we know Q.

38
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,160
Yeah. If we know P and we know P implies

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,760
Q then we know Q. If I think and

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,760
thinking implies amming then I am. Um

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,560
very intuitive. Let's again never

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,599
mention this by name. That's way too uh

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
precise for our uh for our purposes. Um

44
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,440
there are some other famous ones like if

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:43,120
we know P implies Q

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,920
and we know not Q sorry not Q

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,440
then all of this implies all of that

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,440
implies not P.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
This is sort of the opposite direction.

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
If we know P implies Q but Q is false

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,640
then P better be false as well. Um

52
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,800
here's another fun one. Uh if we know

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,800
that not P implies false

54
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,720
then that implies P.

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,599
Basically saying if P isn't false then

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,519
it's true.

57
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
Hopefully intuitive

58
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
but we have the tools to not just rely

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,519
on intuition here. We can verify these

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,239
statements are actual inference rules.

61
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,159
Uh for example by drawing a truth table.

62
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,280
Um let's do that last one just because

63
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,440
it's smaller. Uh let's see. So uh we

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
have our we have P and it has two

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,440
possible values.

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,599
Um and then we have our big old formula.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,840
So not P implies false.

68
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,000
PNS imply P. I want to make sure that

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,319
this formula on the right is always true

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,400
no matter what P is. Um okay. Well, a

71
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
useful way to fill out these uh these

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,519
truth tables

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
um is to go sort of one step at a time.

74
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
And I like to do that by drawing

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,879
directly under the symbol I'm working

76
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,519
with. So like not P. When P is true, not

77
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,360
P is false. And when P is false, not P

78
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,120
is true. And I put that right under the

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,079
the P bar. So I know I'm talking about

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,560
the P bar. Now let's talk about this

81
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,199
implies. Does false imply false?

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Does true imply

83
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
false?

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,680
No, that's the case we need to avoid for

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,199
implication. Okay, so finally um this

86
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,160
this implies is really this whole

87
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,720
parenthetical um clause there. Does true

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
imply true? Because remember this is

89
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
true and false here. Does true imply

90
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,720
true?

91
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah. So this implies in this case is

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,160
true. Does false imply false? also yes.

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,880
Okay, so the column that corresponds to

94
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,360
the whole formula is always true no

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,680
matter what. And that is how we verify

96
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,080
that this statement right here is always

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,600
true. This is one possible way to verify

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,280
that. Um these other um inference rules

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
and lots of other ones that we're going

100
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,639
to use in this class. You can also

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,320
verify this way if you wish. Please

102
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,080
don't like do this in the middle of a

103
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,600
proof. Let's just use these rules. um as

104
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
rules that we're familiar with. You

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
don't have to reprove them every time.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,039
I'm just showing you that we have the

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,880
tools to do it if we wanted to.

108
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,280
All right.

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,919
Um in general, when writing proofs in

110
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,479
this class, um we're going to want each

111
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,360
step to be clear and logical. We're

112
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,680
going to want to use a valid um uh

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,960
inference rule.

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,320
Um but we just want to use it. Um, it

115
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
should be clear from your writing what

116
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,600
rule is being used, but you don't have

117
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,360
to call it out every time. Like modus

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,320
pollins, modus tolins, I didn't even

119
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,840
tell you what that second one means. Um,

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,000
just go ahead and use it. We're going to

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
have a familiar set of tools and

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
deductions uh when writing these proofs.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,240
So just um if you use those or you're

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,039
doing something else that is clear

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,720
enough um use that. And if it's less

126
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,800
clear, explain it more. Um, of course,

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
you should be explaining your steps. Um,

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
usually you're relying on facts that we

129
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,520
proved before or axioms that maybe we

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
haven't explicitly written down yet. And

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,800
you should be identifying those. When

132
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,000
you're relying on something, tell us

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,280
what you're relying on.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,680
Um, let's see. Please don't use what's

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
called proof by intimidation. Clearly,

136
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,960
this is true. This is obvious. This is

137
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,039
intuitive. Uh, in fact, I would strongly

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,080
recommend striking those words from your

139
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,240
mathematical vocabulary entirely. Um,

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,240
anything that is clear and obvious to

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
you, well, first of all, it might not be

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,960
clear and obvious to your readers, um,

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,240
who might be your graders, who might be

144
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,840
your peers. Um, and that can lose your

145
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
points, u, because you didn't explain

146
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,919
yourself fully. That can be demotivating

147
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
for whoever is reading it, like, wait,

148
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,039
this isn't obvious to me. Am I not as

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,880
smart as I thought I was? Um, and of

150
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,880
course, it runs the risk that the thing

151
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,720
you said is obvious is wrong. Um, in

152
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,960
fact, this is a common source of

153
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,919
mistakes because instead of proving it,

154
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,440
you just glossed over it. Um, the proof

155
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,440
is there to help you check that things

156
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,720
are correct and help you catch mistakes.

157
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,599
And if you're skipping the proof, then

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,120
you're skipping that redundancy. Um, so

159
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,919
things are never obvious, things are

160
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
never clear. Please explain it.

161
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,280
Uh

162
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
um I I mentioned last time that we're

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,919
going to take basically all of high

164
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,440
school math as our common set of axioms.

165
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,599
Uh the the one exception to that is if

166
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,440
we ask you to prove a theorem and you

167
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,800
say, "I know this from high school math.

168
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,319
It's an axiom. I'm done." That's maybe

169
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,840
not

170
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
um adhering to the spirit of the

171
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,960
assignment. If we ask you to prove a

172
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,039
statement that you already know is true,

173
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,720
please please go and prove it. Um, we're

174
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,400
asking you to think more deeply about

175
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,960
why it's true. Does that make sense?

176
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,360
Cool. All right. So, using these logical

177
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,000
deductions and things like them, I want

178
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,000
to talk about a couple very common proof

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
outlines.

180
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,240
Proof outlines. Oh, that's not a Q.

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,560
That's a U. about lines

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,599
for proving some of the most common

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,800
shapes that our theorems might take.

184
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,800
For example, if we have a theorem,

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:50,200
there exists a natural number n such

186
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:50,200
that n is at least 10 and uh n is prime.

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
Here's our theorem. There exists a

188
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,040
number that's at least 10 and is prime.

189
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:05,000
There exists a prime um bigger than n.

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,000
Can someone prove this for me?

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
Yes.

192
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,320
17. That's actually the same example in

193
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:20,640
my notes. Well done. Um proof

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,240
n equals 17. Is that a full proof?

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
I mean kind of. Yes.

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240
if we one more time.

197
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,399
Okay. Um so the suggestion was we should

198
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,320
be going through all of the possible

199
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,360
factors of 17 and show that they're not

200
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,279
factors to to verify that 17 is prime.

201
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,880
Absolutely. Um that is something we

202
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,800
haven't done. Um also we haven't checked

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,880
that explicitly. We probably want to do

204
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,120
that. Um, but let me back up and let me

205
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,680
write down what the general proof

206
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,640
usually looks like. Um, let's see.

207
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,640
Proof. Oops.

208
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,399
We'll show that n equals fill in the

209
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,399
blank

210
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,399
works.

211
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,920
This n

212
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,240
is in the set we asked for. It's in the

213
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,360
natural numbers. In this case, we're

214
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,519
going to secretly be using 17. Um, so

215
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,320
it's pretty clear, but in general, it

216
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,800
might be less clear. So,

217
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,800
for reasons

218
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,279
and n is prime

219
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,279
because

220
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,279
reasons.

221
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,399
So this is in general how we recommend

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,480
writing a proof of a of an exists. If

223
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,120
you want to show something exists in a

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
set with a property, you tell us what it

225
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,079
is. You show us why it's in the set, you

226
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,040
show us why it has the property.

227
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,480
Pretty intuitive, right? Hopefully. I

228
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,880
know I just used that word that I said

229
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,839
we weren't we aren't supposed to use. Um

230
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,839
but this is sort of inextricably tied

231
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,880
with what this symbol means. In general,

232
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,640
there exists a natural number. To to

233
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
prove that there exists a number with

234
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,200
this property, you have to show me a

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
number with this property. That's the

236
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
most straightforward way to do it. Um,

237
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,800
and that's what this proof outline is

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
letting us do.

239
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,760
In this particular problem, we're going

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,560
to say we'll show n= 17 works. This

241
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,440
number 17 is a natural number because,

242
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,880
well, yeah, that I I don't know how to

243
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,120
convince you of that if you're not sure

244
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,279
of that. Um and n equ= 17 is prime

245
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,360
because and this is where we should if

246
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,920
we want to be super careful check all

247
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,240
the possible factors um it's not

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,880
divisible by two by three by four etc.

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,399
Uh Eric

250
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,240
I am missing n greater equal to 10 um

251
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,959
yeah we need to show that n satisfies

252
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,959
this whole property um and n is

253
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,760
prime and greater equal to 10 because

254
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,760
reasons.

255
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,600
All right. So more abstractly, if our

256
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,519
theorem is

257
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,160
um there exists X in some set such that

258
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,920
P of X holds, then our proof can often

259
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,600
look like um

260
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,959
choose X equals some specific value that

261
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,680
you have to put in. Um

262
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,279
then X is in S

263
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,320
because

264
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,000
big to-do there.

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,160
These are these are our to-dos

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,480
and p of x is true

267
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,480
because

268
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
to-do.

269
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,959
All right.

270
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,519
Similarly, what if we're asked to prove

271
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,519
a for all

272
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,519
theorem

273
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,639
for all numbers

274
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,760
x in the reals. So for all real numbers

275
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:31,560
x x^2 - 6x

276
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,560
is greater than -10.

277
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,320
So this theorem is about a for all not

278
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,639
an exists. Um when we're asking about

279
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
exists we need just a single example.

280
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,200
But when we're asking about for all

281
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,160
examples aren't enough. Remember last

282
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,079
time when we talked about n^2 + n + 41

283
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,720
being prime lots of times? Well it's not

284
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,720
prime every time. If we're trying to

285
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,200
prove a for all, we need to show it that

286
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,519
the property is true for every possible

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,279
choice of X.

288
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
And in general, let's see what this

289
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,079
outline might look like. So if our

290
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,320
theorem is for all X in some set, P of X

291
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,320
is true.

292
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Our proof usually looks like this.

293
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Proof.

294
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Suppose X is a generic

295
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,000
element of S

296
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:32,120
then P of X is true

297
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,120
because reasons,

298
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,440
right? I'm think it makes sense to put

299
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,279
little question marks in there so we

300
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,079
know that we we have to figure out

301
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,880
what's going on. There we go. this first

302
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,480
line. Suppose X is some element of S.

303
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
Which element? We're not allowed to

304
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
know. We're not allowed to choose a

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,839
particular one. We need to prove that

306
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,959
this is true for every possible choice

307
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,959
of X. Which means in our proof, the only

308
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,959
thing we assume about X is that it's in

309
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,519
S. So you start by taking something in S

310
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,360
and assuming nothing else about it and

311
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,079
then going and and concluding the

312
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,519
property that we need to show.

313
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,360
Again, this kind of like

314
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,560
These might look very similar to you and

315
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,560
they are. Um this says everything in S

316
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,079
has this thing. This says a generic

317
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,320
thing in S has this property. Um the

318
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,320
difference is that suppose X is a

319
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
generic element of S or however you want

320
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,880
to phrase that makes it concrete. It

321
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,199
gives us a particular X to talk about.

322
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,959
So now we have something to use and talk

323
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,120
about and reason about inside of our

324
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,720
proof. Whereas up here, every how do we

325
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,639
approach every that that's a little

326
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,199
daunting. I I only know how to deal with

327
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,360
one. So this gives us one. It's called

328
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,279
x. We know nothing about it except that

329
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,240
it's an s. But at least we have the one

330
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,160
and we can work with it. So whenever you

331
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
see a theorem that starts with a for

332
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,759
all, your first line is almost always

333
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,480
going to be this in order to bring some

334
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,360
into scope that we can talk about. Sound

335
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,360
good? Awesome. So how do we prove this

336
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,360
theorem

337
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:19,040
proof? Let's see. Let's see. Um

338
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,040
suppose x is an element of the real

339
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
numbers.

340
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,120
Then let's see x - 3^ squared is greater

341
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,880
equal 0.

342
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,880
Um because all reals

343
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,920
have non- negative squares.

344
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
This can be a fact we're citing from

345
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,920
high school. We know how the real

346
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,399
numbers multiply to each other. All

347
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,880
right. Right. And once we know this um

348
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,880
let's see equivalently

349
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,279
this thing says that x^2 - 6x

350
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,640
uh is greater or equal to -9

351
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,880
which in turn is greater or equal to -10

352
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,880
as needed.

353
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,880
So we started with pick some element of

354
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:19,760
r without specifying which one. We ended

355
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:24,160
with the property we need is true. QED.

356
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,160
Sound good? QED by the way um is a

357
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,200
common way to mark the end of a proof.

358
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,039
It's Latin for quote erat demonstrandom

359
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,480
which was to be shown. So it's a synonym

360
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,919
for like as needed or um as desired. QED

361
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,320
all the same thing. All right.

362
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,320
Question.

363
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Sure.

364
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,760
So the question was could we do this a

365
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,440
different way? Could we look at like all

366
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,880
the negative numbers and they behave one

367
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,960
way and then look at all the numbers

368
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,240
between zero and three or zero and six

369
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
or something and they behave a different

370
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,679
way and then look at all the rest. Yes,

371
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
absolutely we can do something like

372
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,559
that. That's called proof by cases.

373
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
We're going to talk about it next

374
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,640
lecture.

375
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,520
Um but for now let's move on to the next

376
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,760
common outline which is proving uh

377
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,919
implications.

378
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,679
If we have a theorem

379
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,799
that says P implies Q.

380
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,280
I mentioned we're going to be using

381
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,360
implies all the time.

382
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,880
And often theorems say if this then

383
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,240
that. If P then Q. How do we prove this?

384
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,240
Our proof often looks like

385
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,000
assume P

386
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,000
then Q is true

387
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,240
because reasons

388
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,400
again looks pretty similar to the kind

389
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,000
of thing we're talking about. But this

390
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,640
first sentence assume P assume P is true

391
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
makes things concrete. It instantiates

392
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,720
um the thing we're supposed to be

393
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,280
assuming. Um it gives us something

394
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,760
concrete to work with. We can now live

395
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,480
in this hypothetical where we know for

396
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,559
certain that P is true and then work

397
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,640
with it as if it's true because inside

398
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,720
of this proof for the rest of this proof

399
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,200
it is.

400
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
Assume P. Use that to show Q. Whenever

401
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,559
we're trying to prove an implication,

402
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,520
this is a common way to do it. Um this

403
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,520
is called a direct proof.

404
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,000
Um

405
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,760
we're going to see indirect proofs a bit

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,799
later. Um but there is a another common

407
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,280
way uh actually sorry before that um

408
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,679
let's do an example of proving something

409
00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:00,000
um in this fashion theorem.

410
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,799
Um, if n is a multiple

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,160
of 10,

412
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,080
then it is even.

413
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,039
If n is a multiple of 10, then it is

414
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,320
even. We're proving an implication. N

415
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,600
multiple of 10 implies even.

416
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,200
P implies Q. So even without having to

417
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,200
think very hard proof

418
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,760
assume n is a multiple

419
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,440
of 10.

420
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,840
We know we're going to start with that.

421
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,400
Assume the first thing we know we're

422
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,799
we're going to end with the last thing.

423
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Therefore n is even.

424
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,400
So question mark question mark question

425
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,400
mark.

426
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,080
Therefore, n is even.

427
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
And if we can connect the dots from the

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,600
first line to the last line, we'll have

429
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,360
our proof.

430
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
Notice, by the way, that was kind of an

431
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,600
automatic process. If the theorem is an

432
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,960
implication, then kind of this is what

433
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,799
our proof is commonly going to look

434
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,320
like. So, we can just write it down. And

435
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,960
now we have a clearer, more concrete

436
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,400
sense of the task we're supposed to do.

437
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,679
Starting from the fact that n is even,

438
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,520
we're supposed to derive the fact that

439
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,520
it's sorry, starting from the fact that

440
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,760
it's a multiple of 10, derive the fact

441
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,039
that it's even. So, let's go ahead and

442
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,480
do that. Assume n is a multiple of 10.

443
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,240
Um, what does it mean to be a multiple

444
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,559
of 10?

445
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:28,440
So, n is 10 * k

446
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,440
for some integer k,

447
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:37,600
right?

448
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:39,840
Um, but then n equ= 2 * 5 * k

449
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
and so it's 2 * an integer. Therefore,

450
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,240
it's even. There's our proof. We're

451
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,440
done. Just by identifying where we're

452
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,200
supposed to start and where we're

453
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,559
supposed to end, we were able to bridge

454
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,240
the gap. Sound good?

455
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,679
Nice.

456
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
So, there's another common way of

457
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,240
proving implications.

458
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,240
Um this is called proof by

459
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,240
contraositive.

460
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,880
Recall last uh last lecture we said that

461
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:14,799
P oops P implies Q

462
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:20,000
is equivalent to its contraositive

463
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:22,720
uh let's see not Q implies not P.

464
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,720
This right here is the contraositive

465
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
contraositive.

466
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,440
And so if we're supposed to be proving P

467
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,600
implies Q, sometimes it's more

468
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,159
convenient to instead prove not Q

469
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,039
implies not P.

470
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:44,440
And so our proof outline

471
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,440
um would say proof by contraositive.

472
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,240
So assume

473
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Q is false. Assume not Q.

474
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,000
See assume Q is false.

475
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,679
Then P is false

476
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,840
because question mark,

477
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,400
right? Same as we did for for direct

478
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,799
implications, but we're proving this

479
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,919
implication instead. So assume not Q,

480
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,240
use it to prove not P. And let's see an

481
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,240
example of this

482
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,240
theorem.

483
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,679
Uh let's see. So for all integers n

484
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,919
let's see

485
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,919
if n^ squ is even then

486
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,799
n is even

487
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,600
for all natural numbers n. If n squ is

488
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,440
even then n is even.

489
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,960
Now automatically oh we're proving a for

490
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,960
all. I know how to write that proof

491
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,960
proof.

492
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,360
Suppose n is an integer. Now we have an

493
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,440
n to work with right we need to prove

494
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,760
this implication.

495
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:11,159
Um let's see. So

496
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,159
proof by contraositive

497
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,080
always nice to say what proof technique

498
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,480
you're using if it's maybe not as

499
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,760
self-evident as it might be. So now

500
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
we're indicating we're proving this

501
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,279
implication by contraositive. And once

502
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,600
we've said that both you the writer and

503
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,840
your audience the readers know what's

504
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,840
supposed to come next. Proof of

505
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,880
contraositive. So assume

506
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,200
this thing on the right is false. Assume

507
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,200
n is odd

508
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,200
because that's the opposite of n being

509
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,200
even.

510
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:54,159
Want to show

511
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:59,440
n squ is is not even. N squ is odd.

512
00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:01,360
This by the way wts um want to show

513
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,960
this. This I find is really useful for

514
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,640
me when planning out proofs, thinking

515
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,520
about proofs, sometimes even when

516
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,159
writing proofs. Um, this is an indicator

517
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,159
that this is where I'm trying to go.

518
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,120
This is the end of our proof. This is my

519
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,000
goal. Um, and it signals both to you

520
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,720
that this is work that's left to do. Um,

521
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,640
it signals to your reader that okay,

522
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,320
great. We we agree that we're working

523
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,520
towards the right thing. So now let's go

524
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,440
and do it. Um, and also as you're

525
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,000
writing scratchwork and solving these

526
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,600
proofs, um, and maybe you get distracted

527
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,400
and have to come back later and you see

528
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,919
a bunch of statements on your page.

529
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
Wait, which of these statements did we

530
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,120
prove and which are we trying to work

531
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,799
towards? So, um, as I'm working on these

532
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,279
proofs, I really like to be organized

533
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,840
and say, we know this, we know that, we

534
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,279
want to show this other thing. So, I

535
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
know that we haven't proven it yet and

536
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,760
we want to.

537
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,679
All right. So proof a contraositive. So

538
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,039
assume n is odd. We want to show that n^

539
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,960
squ is odd,

540
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,360
right? Because that's that's what the

541
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,240
proof method tells us to do. And now we

542
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,159
can go do it. Okay. So assume n is odd.

543
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,760
Um so n is 2k + 1. That's what it means

544
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:24,080
to be odd for some

545
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:32,600
integer k. Then n^2 is 4k ^2 + 4k + 1

546
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:32,600
which is 2 * an integer + 1 which is odd

547
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:43,919
q e d. And just to be precise about it

548
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,679
2k oop sorry 2k^ 2 + 2k but two times an

549
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,559
integer plus one is what it means to be

550
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,480
odd. So we're done.

551
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,080
All right.

552
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,679
So, we have proven implication. We've

553
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,320
shown two different proof outlines for

554
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,679
how to show P implies Q. One direct, you

555
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,559
assume P, use it to conclude Q. Um, one

556
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,159
sort of flipped around. Um, assume not

557
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,960
Q, use it to derive not P. Uh, there's a

558
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,960
related proof technique called proof by

559
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,960
contradiction.

560
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,840
Now, in growing up, you might have been

561
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,400
told, "Don't use double negatives.

562
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,240
They're not as clear. It's always much

563
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,200
stronger to more directly say what you

564
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,000
mean." But sometimes in math, a double

565
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,919
negative isn't what we don't want to

566
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,760
avoid.

567
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,919
I think there were four negatives in

568
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,440
there. Got it right. Yeah. Uh double

569
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,919
negatives can sometimes work to our

570
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
favor. uh and proof by contradiction is

571
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,720
exactly

572
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,960
that technique as a proof outline. So

573
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,360
let's talk about what this does. Um

574
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,399
proof by contradiction. So theorem

575
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,640
P whatever P is proof by contradiction

576
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,640
can be used to prove anything you want.

577
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,919
You know sometimes sometimes it it works

578
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
sometimes it doesn't sometimes it's

579
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,679
nicer but it's not assuming a specific

580
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,720
form of theorem.

581
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,520
Our proof looks like this. Um let's see

582
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,840
um for the sake

583
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,840
of contradiction.

584
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,279
Assume P is false.

585
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,320
All right. Assume P is false. Then the

586
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,320
proof continues.

587
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,799
Then some other statement R. Any

588
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,480
statement R we want we get to choose.

589
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,480
Then r is both

590
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,440
true and false,

591
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,039
which is bad. That breaks math.

592
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Propositions are supposed to be true or

593
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,320
false, not both.

594
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,000
Um, that's a sign that our set of axioms

595
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,840
is inconsistent. And remember, that's

596
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,240
the the one thing we don't want them to

597
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,679
be. Um, if something's true and false,

598
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,080
then everything's true and everything's

599
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,880
false. And and that's bad. let's not

600
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,880
break math. Um, which is a

601
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,880
contradiction.

602
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,480
Um, and then to to explain it further,

603
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,480
so our assumption

604
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,440
is wrong.

605
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,120
So, P is true.

606
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,640
So we started by assuming P is false. We

607
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,360
broke math. So the assumption that P is

608
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,399
false must be wrong. So if P is false,

609
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,720
it isn't true. Um now I put this last

610
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,880
sentence in parenthesis because it's

611
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,440
clear, it's clearer than if you leave it

612
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,200
out. Um, but if you're writing between

613
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
people that all agree on how proof by

614
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
contradiction works and understand

615
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,559
what's going on, then just including

616
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,880
this word contradiction at the beginning

617
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,399
and saying

618
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,640
uh what the contradiction that we've

619
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,240
reached is, that's usually enough. You

620
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,520
don't have to have that that summary

621
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,840
statement at the end if you don't want

622
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,159
it. Um, that's a matter of personal

623
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,080
style, but you should be saying right at

624
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,080
the beginning that you're doing a proof

625
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,279
by contradiction, and you should say at

626
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,679
the end what your contradiction is.

627
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,200
Does that make sense?

628
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,200
Cool. Um, yes.

629
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,720
Yeah. Um, that's exactly right. This uh

630
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,000
inference rule that we analyzed at the

631
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,440
beginning is exactly what's justifying

632
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,279
proof by contradiction as a proof

633
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,679
outline. Um, if not P implies that false

634
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,159
is true,

635
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,520
then P has to be true. That's exactly

636
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,120
what this is saying and that's what the

637
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,000
proof technique is doing. Very well

638
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,440
spotted. Thank you. Um, I meant to say

639
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,320
that and might have forgotten. So, thank

640
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,960
you for the reminder. Um, a couple other

641
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,559
things about this. Um, for the sake of

642
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,159
contradiction,

643
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,600
um, there are lots of other ways to say

644
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,200
that. You can just say proof by

645
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,640
contradiction and that's enough to

646
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,679
signal to the reader that you're doing a

647
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,679
proof by contradiction. Um, I've also

648
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,679
seen

649
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,279
block by way of contradiction assume P

650
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,279
is false.

651
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,559
Uh, I have seen that. I like it. I don't

652
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,799
use it as much because I don't think

653
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,519
it's as standard. Um, but it's silly and

654
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,960
I like it. Um, at the end when you find

655
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,960
your contradiction and you want to say

656
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,559
this is a contradiction, we've broken

657
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,200
math. We're done. However you want to

658
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,399
say that part. Um, I've also seen this

659
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,080
symbol equals x equals because it looks

660
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,120
like two arrows pointing at each other

661
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,360
contradicting each other. That's another

662
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,760
fun embellishment if you want. But now

663
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,320
that we've seen the proof outline, hey,

664
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,679
that looks like a smiley face. Um, now

665
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,000
that we've seen the proof outline, let's

666
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:12,000
use it um on a real theorem. and that is

667
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,120
that the square root of two

668
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,279
is not a rational number. So remember

669
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,000
this blackboard bold q is the set of

670
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,159
rational numbers of um integer divided

671
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,559
by non-zero integer the set of all such

672
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,760
things. Uh and the theorem is that

673
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,000
square root of two is not rational.

674
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,960
So let's prove it. Often when your

675
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,919
theorem has a knot on the outside, it is

676
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,799
not true that property. Contradiction is

677
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,640
a common way to handle that because if

678
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:46,279
um because our proof by contradiction is

679
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,279
going to say well proof by contradiction

680
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,080
assume

681
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,519
and again I want to emphasize the moment

682
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,120
we say this is a proof by contradiction

683
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,720
what we assume is fixed. There's only

684
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,960
one thing we're supposed to assume. The

685
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,799
outline tells us what we have to assume,

686
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,039
which is that the entire theorem is

687
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,279
false. That's the only thing we're

688
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,600
supposed to do. We should still say it

689
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,600
because we want you and the reader to

690
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,440
agree that the correct procedure is

691
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,320
being followed. You're assuming the

692
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,640
correct thing. So assume that this is

693
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,440
false. In other words, assume that

694
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,080
square<unk> of two is

695
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,080
a rational number.

696
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,960
uh is not isn't

697
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,519
do what I say not what I write.

698
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,880
Um okay and now let's let's keep going.

699
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,600
What does it mean for square root of two

700
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,600
to be a rational number? Okay. Um so

701
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,840
square<unk> of two equals a over b

702
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,440
um for some

703
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,200
integers a and b where b does not equal

704
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,360
zero.

705
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,919
And as we might recall from high school

706
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,399
math, we can always assume that a

707
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,679
fraction is in lowest terms.

708
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,640
Um, in lowest

709
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,159
terms,

710
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,040
so a and b

711
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,040
have no common divisor,

712
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,639
right? We can always reduce a fraction

713
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,679
to lowest terms. So let's take that

714
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,240
fraction already written in lowest terms

715
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:35,839
and let's keep going from there. Okay.

716
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:40,720
So a over b=<unk> 2 means a =<unk> 2 * b

717
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:46,280
means a^2 = 2 b ^2

718
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,280
which means a^2 is even.

719
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
And wait, we already proved something

720
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,200
about if the square of a number is even

721
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,480
then the number itself is even. It's

722
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,320
very convenient that we already have

723
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:05,119
that there. So since a^ squ is even this

724
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,040
theorem shows us that a is even

725
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,680
by the theorem over there on the

726
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,280
previous board.

727
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,040
Yeah.

728
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:20,119
Okay. What does it mean for a to be

729
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,119
even? So a equals 2 times some integer c

730
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:28,880
for some c oop sorry for some integer I

731
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,119
did it again c in the integers

732
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,920
right that's what it means for a to be

733
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,839
even it's two times an integer so let's

734
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,000
keep going let's put this back into our

735
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:44,720
formula

736
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:46,480
um so now this says that 2 c^ 2 = 2 b

737
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,400
^2.

738
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,839
Right? So this says that 4 c ^2 = 2 b

739
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,040
^2. We can divide by 2. This says 2 c ^2

740
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:01,079
= b ^2.

741
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,079
But now b ^2 is even.

742
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,920
And as we know by our by our lema over

743
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:13,280
there again b is now even

744
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,200
by the same theorem.

745
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah.

746
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Okay. So,

747
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,000
A and B are now both even.

748
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,599
So, they have a common factor

749
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,280
of two.

750
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,920
I to be more precise, no common divisor

751
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,480
is greater than one.

752
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,400
um a and if a and b are in lowest terms

753
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,560
then there's no integer bigger than one

754
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,599
that divides both of them. But we just

755
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,760
found that two divides both of them. So

756
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,280
this is our contradiction. This

757
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,760
statement here contradicts this

758
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,760
statement here.

759
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,560
Right? We have a single statement that

760
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,240
we showed is both true and false.

761
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,800
So we've reached a contradiction and our

762
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,359
proof is done.

763
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,200
Does that make sense?

764
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,160
Awesome.

765
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,160
Very nice. Very nice. Um, let me take an

766
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,599
one more minute to talk about these

767
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,480
proof outline techniques in general. Um,

768
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,560
now these aren't meant to restrict the

769
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,839
way you're allowed to prove things or

770
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,079
restrict the way you're allowed to

771
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,000
express things. They're there as

772
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,920
scaffolds to make sure you're proving

773
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,720
the right things

774
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,800
um and to direct your thinking. The more

775
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,880
you can break down a proof into smaller

776
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,880
and smaller to-dos.

777
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,119
Um first of all, the easier it is to

778
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,359
make sure that your proof is correct. Um

779
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,040
and secondly, the the easier it's going

780
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,920
to be to think about those individual

781
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,280
tasks. Smaller tasks are easier to

782
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,040
handle than larger tasks. Um, also a

783
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
common mistake when writing proofs in

784
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,560
general

785
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,640
is when you're presented with a theorem

786
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,359
to dive right in. Why is this true? How

787
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,920
am I going to figure this out

788
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,680
without taking the time to realize that

789
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,760
actually what's going on in your head,

790
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,359
what you're trying to prove is not

791
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,680
actually what the theorem is asking you

792
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,520
to prove. And so that's just a bunch of

793
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,800
wasted effort and lost points on your

794
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,440
homework. Um if you had taken a few

795
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:32,079
minutes um or with practice a few

796
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,560
seconds to do these um standard

797
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,160
outlining procedures to figure out what

798
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,000
the structure of the proof is supposed

799
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,280
to be,

800
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,119
then now you know what the structure of

801
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,079
the proof is supposed to be and you can

802
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,400
spend your um your precious thinking

803
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,040
cycles thinking about the things that

804
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,280
you're actually supposed to prove.

805
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,119
uh and let me demonstrate this um that

806
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,119
with proof you can make this automatic.

807
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,160
You can make this fast. You can really

808
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,160
use it to help inform your uh your proof

809
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,480
writing endeavors. So let's say we have

810
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,560
a theorem.

811
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:10,079
Let's see. So

812
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:13,800
an integer n is foolish

813
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,800
precisely when

814
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,720
n+1

815
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,720
is barome.

816
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,800
What do these underlying words mean?

817
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,160
Absolutely nothing. But let's imagine

818
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
they actually mean something. Let's

819
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,400
imagine this theorem is meaningful and

820
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,480
we've been asked to prove it.

821
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,480
I claim there's a lot of progress we can

822
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,359
make in writing and structuring this

823
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,160
proof even before we go and look up what

824
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:43,839
these two weird terms mean.

825
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,960
So let's do that. Okay. So this theorem

826
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,680
we can we can phrase it as for all n in

827
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,160
z

828
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:57,320
n is foolish if and only if n plus one

829
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,320
is barome.

830
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,720
Excuse me. Um, now this sorry I would I

831
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,440
prefer to write it like this. FN if and

832
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,880
only if BN plus one. I don't remember if

833
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,599
we talked about if and only if on

834
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,320
Tuesday. Great. Let's talk about it now.

835
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:20,640
Um, so P if and only if Q

836
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,720
also written as P if and only if Q

837
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,240
um means that P and Q are both true or

838
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,400
both false.

839
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:34,040
um P and Q

840
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,040
both true or both false.

841
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,240
It means they're expressing the same

842
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,079
condition. They're they're true in

843
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,560
exactly the same times. They're false in

844
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,320
exactly the same times. So they're

845
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,240
logically equivalent. Um one way you can

846
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,560
define this like we we could just draw

847
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,880
the truth table like we did last time,

848
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,440
but also commonly Oops.

849
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:03,119
Um this is this can be defined as P

850
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,359
implies Q and Q implies P.

851
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,000
If P is true then Q is true and if Q is

852
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:12,319
true then P is true.

853
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,640
All right. Um and this if and only if um

854
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,680
implies in both directions this concept

855
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:22,079
is what we mean when we say precisely

856
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,920
when these are true or false together.

857
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,520
Sound good?

858
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,240
Okay. So, we have our theorem. Let's

859
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,560
prove it. Proof.

860
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,280
Okay. The theorem starts with a for all.

861
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,760
I know how to handle a for all.

862
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,760
Um

863
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,760
suppose n is an integer.

864
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,920
We want to show

865
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:55,040
fn if and only if bn plus one.

866
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,480
Right? That was that was one of the

867
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,720
first outlines we talked about. If you

868
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,640
have a for all, you introduce a generic

869
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,680
one and you want to show the property

870
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,000
for that n. Right?

871
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,560
Okay. Well, now we want to show an if

872
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,720
and only if which we know is defined

873
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,400
like this. So really instead of all of

874
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,000
that, we can be a little more precise

875
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:24,640
with it. We want to show

876
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:29,359
that f(n) implies bn plus one and

877
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,200
that bn plus one implies fn. And once

878
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,160
we've done both of those tasks, we will

879
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,839
have proved the ifolith.

880
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,920
Okay. Well, now we're trying to prove

881
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,079
implications. We know how to prove

882
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,400
implications. Let let's use a direct

883
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,800
method for each of these.

884
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,800
So assume

885
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:53,560
um fn is true. Now we want to show bn

886
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,560
plus one.

887
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,440
So these are sort of separate sections

888
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,920
in our proof.

889
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,800
In this part we are temporarily assuming

890
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,359
that fn is true and using that to prove

891
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,599
that bn plus one is true.

892
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,599
And now down here uh assume

893
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,599
instead

894
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,079
that bn plus one is true. And now we

895
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,160
want to show fn is true.

896
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,960
And now our tasks are very clear to us.

897
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,680
We need to show that if fn then bn plus

898
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,920
one. We need to show um in addition to

899
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,640
that we need to show that if bn plus1

900
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,000
then fn.

901
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,760
And now at this point, there's not

902
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
really much else we can do without going

903
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,839
to look up what these terms mean, use

904
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,240
their definitions, figure out why this

905
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,599
thing is true. But this is where the

906
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,880
interesting part of the proof happens,

907
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,040
where the unique part of the proof

908
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,119
happens, the part that's specific to

909
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,040
this problem. Um,

910
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,560
yeah,

911
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,640
and that's a lot of progress that we

912
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,040
made even before the theorem even makes

913
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,520
sense. So once you get better at this

914
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,599
task um the easier it will be to set

915
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,520
things up correctly and set yourself up

916
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,400
for success.

917
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,000
Questions on that?

918
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
Awesome.

919
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,760
All right. So the other main topic for

920
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,319
today, we talked a lot about proof

921
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,360
outlines, proof by contradiction. The

922
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,480
other main topic is proof by induction.

923
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,480
[Applause]

924
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,880
And interesting I didn't I didn't hear

925
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,640
the groan that I usually get. Um proof

926
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,200
by induction is one of those t one of

927
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,640
those topics that um some students come

928
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,720
in with the impression that it's

929
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,760
difficult um that it's hard to grasp. Um

930
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,440
and there are reasons for that. Um even

931
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,160
before telling you what induction is, I

932
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,599
can tell you that

933
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,560
it's kind of a shame that we have to

934
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,880
teach you induction so early. um because

935
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,400
we're in we're now in the process of

936
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,640
telling you that proofs are supposed to

937
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,640
be clear and self-evident and um and

938
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,240
easy to follow. And then we come to

939
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,920
proof by induction which has a weird

940
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,560
outline that has lots of things you have

941
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,079
to say in weird orders for some arcane

942
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,640
region like we're summoning an ancient

943
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,200
demon. Why do we have to say this in

944
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,119
that particular way in this place? I

945
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,560
don't know. It's confusing and it is

946
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,960
confusing and there's a reason it's

947
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,720
confusing that sort of the reason

948
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,560
induction works and the reason that um

949
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,480
that the proof is structured the way

950
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,400
it's structured

951
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,160
isn't explained in every proof

952
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,599
byinduction

953
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,359
because everyone who's writing a proof

954
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,000
by induction assumes that everyone who's

955
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,160
reading their proof by induction

956
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,800
knows what proof by induction is and why

957
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,440
it works. So every proof by induction

958
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,760
you see is completely opaque and makes

959
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,560
absolutely no sense until you know what

960
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,520
induction is. And I think that's why it

961
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,560
can be difficult to approach. Um what

962
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,240
we're going to talk about right now is

963
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,640
first of all before I tell you what

964
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,240
proof by induction is let's solve a

965
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,599
problem together that's sort of going to

966
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,839
lead us to the the why and the how and

967
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,079
the what of induction. It's going to

968
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,000
tell us what we need to do and what tool

969
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,760
we need to do it and then induction will

970
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,960
be there right at the end to say I'm the

971
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:20,079
tool for the job.

972
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:23,079
So here is a theorem

973
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,079
theorem

974
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,000
for all n and z for uh sorry for all

975
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:37,839
natural numbers n

976
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,359
1 + 2 + 3 + up to n equals n * n + 1 /

977
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,960
2.

978
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,960
This might be familiar to some of you.

979
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,319
There are lots of ways to prove it. You

980
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,839
can prove it by induction. You can prove

981
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,760
it by picture. You can prove it by

982
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,680
counting. There are lots and lots of

983
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
ways. Um, we're going to talk through

984
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,920
one particular way of making sense of

985
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,599
this theorem. And let's just go by

986
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,599
intuition. I'm not we're not doing

987
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,200
induction right now. We're just we're

988
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,000
just figuring out why this thing is

989
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,440
true. Uh, so first of all, let's make

990
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,040
sure we understand what this thing is

991
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,480
even saying. Um for example

992
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:16,160
um so eg when n equals 4 this is

993
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:19,119
claiming that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 equals 4 * 5

994
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,560
over 2 which looks pretty good. This is

995
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,720
10 this is 20 over2. Yeah they're equal.

996
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,560
And we're supposed to prove this um this

997
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,119
kind of thing for every natural number

998
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:35,119
n. Yeah. Um even all the way down to

999
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,000
just n equals 1. eg n equals 1. What's

1000
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,880
the sum from one up to one?

1001
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,800
It's just the one itself.

1002
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,359
One is the sum of one term. Um, and

1003
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,079
that's supposed to equal 1 * 2 over 2,

1004
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:54,079
which looks like it does

1005
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,800
even down to n equals 0.

1006
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,560
What is the sum from one up to zero?

1007
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,200
That's weird.

1008
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,599
Um, that is a little weird. Turns out we

1009
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,520
can make sense of it. um in this in this

1010
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:11,599
context. So another way to write this

1011
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,520
is with what's called sigma notation

1012
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,440
k goes from one up to n of k.

1013
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,119
And you can think of this like a for

1014
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,800
loop. You start at k equals 1 and you

1015
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,880
write down the value of k in that case

1016
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,559
one. Then you go up to k equals 2 and

1017
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,480
write down the value. k equals 3 write

1018
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,240
down the value. All the way up to this

1019
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,640
part you go up to k equals n write down

1020
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,119
the value. And the sigma says you add

1021
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,760
all these together. Sigma is the the

1022
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,640
Greek s for sum.

1023
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:44,640
Um so this is notation for exactly this

1024
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,920
sum from 1 to n. Um and by convention

1025
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,800
and there are good reasons for this

1026
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,800
convention. But by convention

1027
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,880
the sum from k= 1 to 0 the sum of zero

1028
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:01,920
terms of whatever you want in here. But

1029
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,079
now we're talking about the sum k

1030
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,480
is just zero. The empty sum is zero. If

1031
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,400
you're adding nothing, you have a total

1032
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,200
of zero.

1033
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,640
And in that case, the sum the empty sum

1034
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,280
is 0, which is supposed to equal 0 * 1 /

1035
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,319
2. And it does. Hooray. This theorem is

1036
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,119
true when n equals 0 and one. And four.

1037
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,200
We verified three cases, which is a

1038
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,200
pretty good 0% of all the cases we're

1039
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,040
trying to show.

1040
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,630
But it's a good start. So, let's see

1041
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,610
how to continue.

1042
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,610
[Applause]

1043
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:57,359
So, we are trying to show that 0 = 0 * 1

1044
00:49:51,040 --> 00:50:04,480
/ 2. 1 = 1 * 2 / 2. 1 + 2

1045
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:07,760
uh is 2 * 3 / 2. 1 + 2 + 3 uh is 3 * 4 /

1046
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:13,200
2. I'll stop in a minute, I promise. 1 +

1047
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:15,119
2 + 3 + 4 uh = 4 * 5 / 2. Let's stop

1048
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,960
there for now. But we're supposed to

1049
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,480
prove all of these statements. That's

1050
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:23,119
what the theorem is asking from us.

1051
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,680
And we can we can think about this a

1052
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,880
little bit. Um, if we stare at this, we

1053
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,359
can notice that on the left side, to get

1054
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,760
from this to this, we're adding one. To

1055
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,520
get from this to this, we're adding two.

1056
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,160
It's right there in how this sum is

1057
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,240
created. To get from here to here, we're

1058
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,319
adding three. Again, we're just adding

1059
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,160
one more term to the sum. Then we're

1060
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,920
adding four. Then we're adding five.

1061
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,640
Then six, then seven, then eight, and so

1062
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,400
on. There's a very simple pattern that

1063
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,960
explains how these numbers are changing

1064
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,200
from one row to the next.

1065
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,880
So, wouldn't it be convenient if the

1066
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,559
numbers on the right side followed that

1067
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,480
same pattern?

1068
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,880
And if they did, it would it would make

1069
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,200
a lot of sense, at least to me, that

1070
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,119
since they start at the same number and

1071
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,599
we're making the same changes to both

1072
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,079
sides every time we move down a row,

1073
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,359
that all the rows are going to be equal,

1074
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,960
that the left side is going to be the

1075
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,720
right side in every row. Yeah. So, we're

1076
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,040
hoping

1077
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,760
that that's a plus one and that's a plus

1078
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,680
two and that's a plus three and that's a

1079
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,280
plus4

1080
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,720
and so on. These are question marks

1081
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,240
because we don't really know whether

1082
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,240
that's true yet.

1083
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:41,200
Uh, so let's write down what we're

1084
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:44,319
hoping is true. 1 + 2 + up to n is

1085
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,760
supposed to equal n * n + 1 / 2. And

1086
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,880
then the next row, 1 plus 2 + n plus the

1087
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,559
next term, n + 1 is supposed to equal n

1088
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,400
+ 1 * n + 2

1089
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,440
divided by two. These are two

1090
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,880
consecutive rows in our big list. And

1091
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,800
what we were saying is to get from here

1092
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,480
to there, we're definitely adding n plus

1093
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,000
one.

1094
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,319
We're just adding this one more term

1095
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,240
over here. So is it true that to get

1096
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,240
from here to here, we're adding n plus

1097
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,240
one?

1098
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:23,599
And we can check that. Let's see. Um, n

1099
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:25,680
+ 1 * n + 2 / 2 minus n * n + 1 / 2.

1100
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, we can factor in n+1 from both

1101
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:34,160
sides. That's n +1 *

1102
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,680
n + 2 / 2 - n /2.

1103
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,680
That's looking pretty good. That's going

1104
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,920
to be n +1 * 2 over2 * 1. That's just n

1105
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,920
plus one.

1106
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,880
So our hunch about that pattern is true.

1107
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:52,000
To go from the nth row to the n plus

1108
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,200
first row, we're adding n plus one.

1109
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,880
Yeah. So what we said earlier is true.

1110
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,480
This pattern of add one then two then

1111
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,440
three then four then five that we saw on

1112
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,880
the left is recreated on the right. Add

1113
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,640
one, add two, add three, add four, add

1114
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,680
five and so on.

1115
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,359
So, at least to me, this feels like an

1116
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,960
explanation that should make sense and

1117
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,960
an explanation that we should be able to

1118
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,480
write down somehow as a mathematical

1119
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,240
proof.

1120
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,559
Does anyone have questions about this

1121
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,240
idea? I haven't said anything about how

1122
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,480
we're going to write this, but is the

1123
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,480
idea clear?

1124
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,400
Awesome.

1125
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:31,760
Um, let's see.

1126
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:36,440
So let's dig in a little more and see

1127
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,440
what exactly we accomplished over there.

1128
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,079
So this argument here on the right um

1129
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,520
that we did over here, let me write down

1130
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,280
a little more carefully what we

1131
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,119
accomplished.

1132
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:55,440
Um and it's going to look like this. Um,

1133
00:53:53,119 --> 00:54:01,599
if

1134
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:03,920
1 + 2 + n = n * n + 1 over two. If

1135
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,920
that's true,

1136
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,920
then

1137
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:19,400
1 + 2 +

1138
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:19,400
n + 1 equals n + 1 n + 2 over 2.

1139
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,040
because we just

1140
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,240
added n + one to both sides.

1141
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,160
You would also want the algebra work to

1142
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,920
show that going from this to this really

1143
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,680
is just adding n plus one. And that's

1144
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,040
exactly what we did over there. I don't

1145
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,200
want to write it again, so I just wrote

1146
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,800
the word algebra.

1147
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,720
Does it make sense that this is what we

1148
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,680
accomplished?

1149
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,599
If this row of our list is true, if left

1150
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,440
side equals right side, then the next

1151
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,520
row is also true. Yeah,

1152
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,079
cool. So, let's put some notation to

1153
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,960
this.

1154
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,520
I'm going to say that

1155
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,000
P of N is the statement. By the way,

1156
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,079
this colon equals is a way that we'll

1157
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,480
commonly say P of N is defined to be

1158
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,480
this thing. So not only is it equal to

1159
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,599
this, but this line right here is the

1160
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:24,319
definition of P of N. So let's define P

1161
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:29,680
of N to be the statement that 1 + 2 + up

1162
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:32,240
to N equals N * N + 1 / 2.

1163
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:36,480
So PN is a predicate. It's not a theorem

1164
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:40,400
on its own. Uh what is a theorem

1165
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,720
is that for all n greater equal zero,

1166
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,400
p of n is true.

1167
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,319
That's what we're being asked to prove.

1168
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,799
That's that's just a restatement of our

1169
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:53,119
theorem from the top board over there.

1170
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:55,119
And now

1171
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,359
what we accomplished over on that board.

1172
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,119
Actually, I want a fresh board for this.

1173
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,119
Um, that's going to be this board up

1174
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,119
here.

1175
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,799
What we accomplished is first of all we

1176
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,799
proved

1177
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:27,760
P of 0.

1178
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,680
That's the the first line up here.

1179
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,960
And then

1180
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:36,720
um these these statements up here, what

1181
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,000
that's saying is that PN implies PN plus

1182
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,640
one.

1183
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,319
So we proved

1184
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:50,160
P 0 implies P1. We proved P1 implies P2.

1185
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:53,839
P2 implies P3.

1186
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:56,319
P3, I'll stop, I promise, implies P4,

1187
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,640
and all the way down.

1188
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,960
This is what we really accomplished on

1189
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,559
these last couple boards.

1190
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:07,880
But this isn't the theorem we're aiming

1191
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,880
for, right? The theorem we're aiming for

1192
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:16,880
asks for P of zero, oops,

1193
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:19,520
and P of one and P of two and P of three

1194
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,599
and P of four and all the way down. We

1195
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,440
want to know that all of these are true.

1196
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,920
These implications are are not what

1197
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,760
we're asking for.

1198
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,680
However, it kind of feels like this

1199
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,640
should be enough, right? Because once we

1200
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,720
know P of 0 and we know P of 0 implies P

1201
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,760
of one then modus ponins we know P of

1202
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,319
one and once we know P of one this

1203
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,640
implication tells us P of two once we

1204
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,400
know P of two pair with this we get P of

1205
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,599
three then we get P of four then all the

1206
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,960
way down we get all of them I don't know

1207
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:54,160
how to write that yet but that's the

1208
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,200
intuition that I have guiding this um

1209
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,880
and so it really feels like if we

1210
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,720
accomplish the left side we should be

1211
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,040
able to conclude the right side. Do we

1212
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,119
agree?

1213
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,760
All right. Um and now we have the

1214
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,760
principle of induction

1215
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,880
which just says

1216
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,640
what we wanted to say.

1217
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,240
The left hand side of this table implies

1218
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,599
the right hand side of this table. If

1219
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,799
you know all of these, then you conclude

1220
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:31,359
all of these.

1221
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:34,359
So when we're structuring a proof by

1222
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,359
induction,

1223
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,520
we must prove everything here on the

1224
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,520
left. That is our responsibility. And

1225
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,520
then

1226
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,720
everything on the right we get for free.

1227
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,319
by the principle of induction.

1228
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:01,440
To be more precise, principle of

1229
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:04,160
induction says if you know

1230
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,520
P of 0 and

1231
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:11,599
for all n greater equal z, p of n

1232
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,000
implies p of n plus one.

1233
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:18,480
That implies

1234
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,160
for all n greater equal z p of n.

1235
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,680
So that's exactly what's written in this

1236
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,480
table just in formula form. P of 0 is

1237
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,119
this first one over here. And then all

1238
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,280
of the PN's imply PN plus1's are all of

1239
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,000
the remaining stuff. And it says if we

1240
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,319
accomplish all of these then we can

1241
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,319
conclude these.

1242
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,319
Yes.

1243
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,960
Good question. So is the principle of

1244
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,839
induction a new axiom or is it just a

1245
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:53,119
name for this this intuitive fact that

1246
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:55,520
we have? Um in truth what it's really an

1247
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:58,240
axiom about is how the how the natural

1248
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,760
numbers are constructed. Um really what

1249
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,559
it's saying is that if you start from

1250
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:06,799
zero and then add one add one add one

1251
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:09,680
add one add one um to infinity you will

1252
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,680
hit all the natural numbers. That's one

1253
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,200
way of thinking about it. But in

1254
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,799
practice when we use the principle of

1255
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,880
induction we're using it like this. Um

1256
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:20,640
so yeah you can take it as an axiom you

1257
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,559
can take it as following from the

1258
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,920
definition of the natural numbers. We

1259
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:28,480
didn't really go that far down in um in

1260
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,280
defining our fundamentals. So we'll just

1261
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,119
leave it like this. Good question.

1262
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,799
All right. So we have the principle of

1263
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,359
induction.

1264
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:39,440
We know what it's accomplishing and why.

1265
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,680
So how do we actually write using the

1266
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,480
principle of induction? Let's actually

1267
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,480
write this proof now.

1268
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,760
And the thing to always keep in mind

1269
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,000
when writing a proof by induction is

1270
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,520
this table.

1271
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,760
We are responsible for proving

1272
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,280
everything on the left side and then

1273
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,880
we're able to conclude everything on the

1274
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,640
right side.

1275
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,000
So the theorem that we're trying to

1276
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,440
prove should be the right side and then

1277
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,119
we're going to do the left side to get

1278
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:15,240
it. So

1279
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,240
proof by induction

1280
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:28,319
um we need to say what p of n um let's

1281
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:32,880
see p of n is defined as the sum

1282
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:34,640
n + one over two same way we defined pn

1283
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:38,280
um before

1284
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,280
and we'll show

1285
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,359
that

1286
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,680
PN is true for every n greater equal 0

1287
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,680
by induction.

1288
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:57,359
So the first thing we're responsible for

1289
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,240
is P 0. That's usually called the base

1290
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,720
case.

1291
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,000
Base case

1292
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:09,839
want to show P of zero.

1293
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,720
Well, P of 0 says that 0 = 0 * 1 / 2,

1294
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:14,319
which is true. So, we verified P of 0.

1295
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,520
Usually, the base cases are pretty

1296
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,599
straightforward. Um, it's the inductive

1297
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,599
step,

1298
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,599
inductive

1299
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:29,359
step that we need to watch out for. Um,

1300
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,280
we we now need to prove this whole

1301
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,920
thing.

1302
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,480
And we usually write it like this. um

1303
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,520
assume

1304
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,920
n is greater or equal zero

1305
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,920
and assume

1306
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:52,680
pn is true.

1307
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:52,680
We want to show pn plus one is true.

1308
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,839
And notice what we just wrote is exactly

1309
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,119
the unpacked outline for this theorem.

1310
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:03,040
It starts with for all. So assume n. It

1311
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,440
then has an implication. So assume the

1312
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,799
left side. Let's prove the right side.

1313
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,640
Right? The things we write when we're

1314
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:11,920
doing a proof by induction are not

1315
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,599
magic. They're just unpacking this.

1316
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,839
And now we can do it. The next thing I

1317
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,640
always recommend um when proving

1318
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:20,640
something by induction.

1319
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,240
What is P of N? What is P of N plus one?

1320
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,240
I know we defined it, but I can't

1321
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,000
remember what it is. I always find it

1322
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:32,280
much more useful to write these things

1323
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,280
down in context. So in other words,

1324
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,520
assume

1325
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:46,319
we're supposed to assume p of n. So

1326
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:50,720
assume 1 + 2 + up to n = n * n + 1 / 2.

1327
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:55,160
And we want to show PN plus one which

1328
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,160
says that the next row

1329
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:01,839
uh n plus1 * n plus2

1330
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,280
over two.

1331
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,280
All right. And just by following the

1332
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,440
proof outline and by identifying the

1333
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,599
things we're supposed to identify now we

1334
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,839
have a very clear task in front of us.

1335
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,480
Assume this row, use it to prove this

1336
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:16,240
next row. And we've already done that.

1337
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,839
We know how to do that.

1338
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,760
Um,

1339
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:22,559
we know that this thing equals that

1340
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,319
thing and then this plus that equals

1341
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,559
that because of algebra. This is all the

1342
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,960
work we already did. And now we're

1343
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:31,680
seeing how the induction outline leads

1344
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,319
us to figuring out that that is the

1345
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:37,720
right work to do. Did that all make

1346
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,720
sense? Yes.

1347
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,640
Great question. Does this have to start

1348
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,599
at zero or could it start somewhere

1349
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,319
else?

1350
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:51,039
Um, yeah, it can start wherever we want.

1351
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:53,599
Um, if if we didn't know that P of zero

1352
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:56,799
really made sense, uh, and we wanted to

1353
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:58,720
start at P of one, we absolutely could

1354
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:01,520
have started at P of one as our base

1355
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:04,880
case and then all the implications above

1356
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,720
that. Just keep in mind that by not

1357
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,319
mentioning P of zero, we didn't prove P

1358
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,880
of zero and so we can't conclude it

1359
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:14,160
either. But wherever we started and all

1360
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,400
the implications after it um those fit

1361
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,640
together um to give us the thing on the

1362
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,640
right side. Um yes that's a slightly

1363
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,960
more general form of the proof of the

1364
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:26,079
induction principle. Um please go ahead

1365
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,720
and use that version as well.

1366
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:31,920
All right.

1367
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,760
So let's do one more proof by induction.

1368
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,559
Uh this is a really pretty problem. This

1369
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:40,160
seems to be a mandatory problem for any

1370
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:42,559
textbook on discrete math. Um, it's one

1371
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,599
of my favorites. And here is the

1372
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,020
problem. Which board did I leave on?

1373
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,230
This one.

1374
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,230
[Applause]

1375
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,480
So, the story is like this. We have a

1376
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,480
big old courtyard.

1377
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,000
um subdivided into lots and lots of tiny

1378
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:19,039
little cells. It's going to be 2 to the

1379
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,440
n tall and 2 to the n wide. So imagine

1380
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,760
like 64 by 64. It's a big old

1381
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,520
checkerboard.

1382
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,280
Um

1383
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:30,920
I'm just going to draw 8 by 8 because I

1384
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,920
don't have that kind of time.

1385
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,760
And now we're going to take a single

1386
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,720
cell

1387
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,440
and get rid of it. Which cell? I don't

1388
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:45,839
know. Doesn't matter. Um the question

1389
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:49,480
is, can we then fill the remaining cells

1390
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,480
with these LORs?

1391
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,640
You might know the word domino. It's two

1392
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,119
squares next to each other. It's a it's

1393
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,200
a fun game. Um this is like a domino,

1394
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,039
but it's three squares instead of two.

1395
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,839
and it's in the shape of an L. So it's

1396
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,559
called the L traumo. And the question is

1397
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:09,119
can we fill all of this board without

1398
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:13,119
that one missing cell

1399
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:17,119
um using L trainos and nothing else.

1400
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:23,280
So that is our theorem theorem

1401
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:28,920
um a 2 to the n by 2 to the n board

1402
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,920
uh without one cell without any one cell

1403
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:39,559
can be tiled

1404
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,559
with l prominos.

1405
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:45,119
So that's what we're supposed to prove.

1406
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,599
And let's see if I can set this up

1407
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:51,119
quickly.

1408
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:54,880
Um, yeah, that's all right. See if I can

1409
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,960
get the glare a little different. Okay,

1410
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,559
I do want to plug in. Thank you. I

1411
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:02,680
always forget this in Zoom meetings,

1412
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,680
too. Please share your screen.

1413
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,240
Yes. All right. So, I I I laser cut some

1414
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,720
toys to help us play with this puzzle.

1415
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,400
Um, so we're supposed to prove that a

1416
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:15,359
two to the n by two to the n board can

1417
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:19,440
always be tiled with elmos. Here, let me

1418
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:22,480
put something on there for you to enjoy.

1419
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,759
Well, let's phrase it like it were um

1420
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,920
like we were going to prove it with

1421
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,319
induction because we are. So let's say

1422
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,480
that P of N

1423
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:35,199
is going to be

1424
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:38,480
um a two to the N by two to the N board

1425
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:42,319
without one cell without any one cell.

1426
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,799
Doesn't matter which one you pick

1427
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:45,799
can be tiled

1428
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,279
with L's. Going to call them L's not L

1429
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,719
trromos. And notice I kind of just wrote

1430
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,159
the same thing twice. That often

1431
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,839
happens. P of N is not our theorem. It's

1432
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,480
the predicate

1433
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:02,799
um which is inside of the for all that

1434
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,279
is part of the theorem. So this is

1435
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:08,719
really every 2 to the n by two to the n

1436
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:10,319
board. Um so if p of n is this then our

1437
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:14,400
theorem

1438
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:16,560
is that for all n greater equal 1 p of n

1439
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,120
is true.

1440
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,719
All right. And now we need to prove

1441
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:25,120
this. Okay. Um let's start with n equals

1442
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,520
1. You can think about what n equals 0

1443
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,359
means. It turns out it's true. Um but

1444
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,440
let's start with n equals 1. So a 2 to

1445
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,000
the 1x 2 to the one board. That's a 2 x

1446
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,719
two board. Um and can you see the the

1447
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,520
little um crosshairs in there? It's a 2

1448
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,480
x two grid. And we're supposed to say no

1449
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,799
matter which single piece no matter

1450
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:47,520
which single cell we remove, we can

1451
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:50,520
always tile what remains with these

1452
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,520
L-shapes.

1453
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:56,159
Anyone see how to do it?

1454
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,679
Yeah. All right. I'm gonna put that

1455
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,360
there.

1456
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,440
Solved.

1457
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,400
What if the missing cell was in a

1458
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,760
different place? Like there. Yep. Okay.

1459
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,880
Can still solve that. We're allowed to

1460
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:12,320
rotate. So the 2 by 2 case isn't very

1461
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,000
hard. Um, so let's keep track of our

1462
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,440
progress.

1463
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
P of one. Actually, I'm going to write

1464
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,120
this as

1465
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,679
the 2x two case. Not very hard. Let's

1466
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:27,280
let's step it up a little. What about

1467
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:31,040
the 4x4 case?

1468
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:32,719
And say we're trying to avoid that one

1469
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,480
cell. Well, we also need to solve it for

1470
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,679
avoiding that one cell and that one

1471
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,199
cell. We need to solve all 16 cases

1472
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,719
because the theorem says it doesn't

1473
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,880
matter which one you exclude. You can

1474
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,040
always tile the rest.

1475
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,679
Um, well, you can play around with this.

1476
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,360
I have lots and lots of of pieces to

1477
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,280
play with.

1478
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,480
You can you can tell I had way too much

1479
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:57,280
fun designing this thing. Um, and turns

1480
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,840
out you can you can make it work. Um,

1481
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,480
like this one. This is one of the 16

1482
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,640
examples. Turns out if I put that one

1483
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,679
there and then that one there and there

1484
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,320
and there and there, then I've solved

1485
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,000
it. I've solved this one out of 16

1486
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,800
cases.

1487
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:19,239
Um, but also it turns out it's not too

1488
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,239
difficult to generalize from there.

1489
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:25,920
Um, like if the missing cell is in

1490
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,920
one of these four positions, then I know

1491
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,560
how to do it.

1492
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,440
If it's in one of these four positions,

1493
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,120
then I also know how to do it. If it's

1494
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,760
there, I can just put that there. If

1495
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:40,000
it's there, I can put that there. If

1496
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,440
it's in one of these four spots, can

1497
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,280
still do it.

1498
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,480
if it's one of these four spots can

1499
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:49,120
still do it. So by looking at all of

1500
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,199
those 16 cases combined, we now have a

1501
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,199
way that can put that yellow cell

1502
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,719
anywhere we want and finish tiling the

1503
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:58,800
rest. Not a very

1504
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,520
nice or clean argument, but at least we

1505
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,480
did all 16 cases. So that's good enough

1506
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:07,800
for now. Let's call the 4x4 case solved

1507
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,800
for now

1508
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:14,880
and move on. Um, and I want to emphasize

1509
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,560
this is actually a key moment in this

1510
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,480
proof.

1511
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,719
We just solved the 4x4 case by looking

1512
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,600
at all 16 cases and showing that they're

1513
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,840
all possible. I want you to hold that

1514
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,679
deep in your heart that we have solved

1515
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:32,880
4x4. Any 4x4 you ever see with a single

1516
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,480
missing cell can be tiled.

1517
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,719
Yeah.

1518
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,640
I want you to hold that deeply in your

1519
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,120
heart and then not worry too much about

1520
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,679
how we did all the 16 cases. Just know

1521
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,679
that it's true. Are we comfortable with

1522
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:50,640
that for now? 4x4 case is fully solved.

1523
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,560
Let's move on to 8 by8.

1524
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,520
We have an 8 by8. There's a single cell

1525
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,920
we're trying to avoid. Maybe it's there.

1526
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,239
Um maybe it's over here. Let's leave it

1527
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,920
there. I don't care. Um what we're

1528
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,640
really looking for here is sort of a

1529
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:08,239
generalizable method. I don't want to do

1530
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:11,040
64 cases and in the 16 x 16 case I don't

1531
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:13,600
want to do what is that 256 cases.

1532
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,520
Please don't make me. Um we want a

1533
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,640
generalizable process that we can that

1534
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,679
we can use to solve every board size.

1535
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:25,199
Um and here is a cool idea that works

1536
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:28,560
nicely. Um

1537
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,520
so first thing we're going to do, we're

1538
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,080
going to we're going to shift our

1539
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:35,679
perspective. This isn't an 8 by8 board.

1540
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:37,440
This is for 4x4 boards.

1541
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,760
All right.

1542
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,440
And now um let me just make this one

1543
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,280
purple for now to remember that that's

1544
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,640
the special one. We cannot move that

1545
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:49,440
one. However, remember we we have solved

1546
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,120
the 4x4 case. So like if we if we're

1547
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,120
missing a cell somewhere in this

1548
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,400
quadrant and missing a cell somewhere in

1549
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,880
this quadrant and missing a cell

1550
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,560
somewhere in this quadrant,

1551
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,600
but now we just have four instances of

1552
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,760
the 4x4 problem. We have four 4x4s each

1553
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,960
missing a single cell. And we know how

1554
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,800
to solve all of those, right? So, we

1555
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,760
know how to solve all of the red that

1556
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,520
remains. Unfortunately, we're not

1557
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,800
actually allowed to use these individual

1558
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,400
cells. We're supposed to cover

1559
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,800
everything with our L-shaped tiles.

1560
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,280
Um, but remember, doesn't matter where

1561
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,640
we put these yellow ones. Anywhere we

1562
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,239
put this in here, we know how to solve

1563
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,280
that quadrant. Anywhere we put this in

1564
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,120
here, we know how to solve that

1565
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,480
quadrant. The purple one was the one

1566
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,400
that's given to us. We're not allowed to

1567
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:36,080
move that. Um, but the next clever idea

1568
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,960
is what if we put the yellow ones right

1569
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:41,440
there and then think of them as not

1570
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:46,239
three individual cells, but as an L in

1571
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:49,600
their own right. No, there we go.

1572
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:52,320
So now this is going to be our key idea.

1573
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,239
Um, if we're trying to tile

1574
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:58,239
everything except the single special

1575
01:14:54,239 --> 01:15:02,000
cell, step one, think about it as four

1576
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:03,840
separate quadrants. Step two, put an L

1577
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,719
right in the middle, directly in the

1578
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,840
middle, to make sure that each of the

1579
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,600
four quadrants is now missing one cell.

1580
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,520
Yeah.

1581
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,280
If this initial cell that we're supposed

1582
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,440
to avoid is somewhere else, well, then

1583
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,960
we just put the L to touch the other

1584
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,880
three quadrants. So, we just rotate it

1585
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,120
this way instead.

1586
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
And once again, every single quadrant,

1587
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:29,199
all four quadrants are missing a single

1588
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:32,800
cell to really drive that home.

1589
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:34,880
Let's see. Uh, we have this shape here.

1590
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,360
That's a 4x4 missing a corner. This

1591
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,679
shape here is a 4x4 missing a corner.

1592
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:43,120
Here's a 4x4 missing a corner. Here's a

1593
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:45,920
4x4 missing that initial cell. So we

1594
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,239
have four separate problems where if we

1595
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,920
can solve the four orange cases, we'll

1596
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:52,560
be able to piece them back together to

1597
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,239
form a solution. And this is why we

1598
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,040
stored that deep in our heart. We know

1599
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,040
we can solve 4x4s with a cell missing.

1600
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:02,239
So we know all four of these orange

1601
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:04,719
quadrants can be filled.

1602
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:07,440
So we already know that this bigger

1603
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,760
shape can also be filled.

1604
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,440
So we're done. No matter where this one

1605
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,199
started,

1606
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,640
um, we can do this thing. We, we put

1607
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,080
down the cross, we put the L in the

1608
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,480
middle. Now we have four quadrants, each

1609
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,040
missing a cell. We invoke the 4x4 case.

1610
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,520
And now we've solved any 8 by8 case

1611
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,199
that's given to us. Does that make

1612
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,120
sense?

1613
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,719
So if we believe that we can solve every

1614
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,400
4x4,

1615
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:33,679
then we also believe that we can solve

1616
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,840
every 8 by 8. Yeah.

1617
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:38,080
And this keeps going. If you instead had

1618
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,800
an 8 by8, sorry, if you instead had a 16

1619
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,560
x6, you can do the same thing. Draw the

1620
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,719
crosshairs, put the L in the middle. Now

1621
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,679
all four 8 by8 quadrants are missing a

1622
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:50,719
single cell. Invoke the 8 by8 case. Um,

1623
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:54,280
we can even see that here.

1624
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,280
Go away webcam.

1625
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:01,199
Um, so here here is a 16x6 with one cell

1626
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,880
we're supposed to avoid. So let's cut it

1627
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,040
into four quadrants and put an L right

1628
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,520
there in the middle. Now we should think

1629
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:10,400
of this as four separate 8 by8s each

1630
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,239
missing a single cell

1631
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,840
and we trust in our heart that we have

1632
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:17,679
solved the 8 by8 case. Right? Don't

1633
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,440
worry too much about how we solved it.

1634
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,800
Just be confident that we solved the 8

1635
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:26,080
by8 case. Um that there is a way to tile

1636
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,159
each of the 8 by8 corners. Um so now we

1637
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:31,440
can piece them together to form our our

1638
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:34,320
16x6 solution. And now it's all it's all

1639
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,440
L tile tiles and we win.

1640
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:41,719
So this is the idea behind this proof uh

1641
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,719
that we're that we're able to show

1642
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,719
that PN

1643
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,120
always implies P of N plus one. If you

1644
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,280
can tile a 2 to the N by two to the N

1645
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,239
missing one cell

1646
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:00,400
then you can tile Oops. Then you can

1647
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:02,000
tile a 2 to the n plus1 by 2 to the n

1648
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,040
plus1

1649
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,960
missing a tile using our strategy of

1650
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:10,000
taking the 2 to the n plus1 by 2 to the

1651
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:13,360
n plus one

1652
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,760
and cutting it into four quadrants

1653
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,920
of 2 to the n by 2 to the n. Put an l in

1654
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:21,280
the middle. Make sure each quadrant is

1655
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,360
missing a cell. Invoke the the inductive

1656
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,520
hypothesis.

1657
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,440
That was a little sketchy. Um I didn't

1658
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,800
write this down carefully. uh you can

1659
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,080
check the lecture notes later if you

1660
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,120
want to see this written down a little

1661
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,960
more carefully but that is the core idea

1662
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:37,040
um and the problem I want you to see

1663
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:41,199
there's one more thing I want to mention

1664
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:42,960
before we go um so I I kept saying store

1665
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:44,960
it deep in your heart that we've solved

1666
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,600
the 4x4 and then use that to believe

1667
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,760
that we've solved 8 by8 um believe that

1668
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:53,040
we solved 8 by8 in order to believe that

1669
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:55,280
we've solved 16 x6 but sometimes belief

1670
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:58,880
isn't quite enough and you really want

1671
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:01,920
to actually run this algorithm. Um well,

1672
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:04,320
for then all all you have to do is um

1673
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,120
when you h when we have the 16 x 16 and

1674
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,719
you break it down into 8 by8s. Well,

1675
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,800
let's actually remember how we solved

1676
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,280
the 8 by8s. We did that by splitting

1677
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,719
them up into 4x4s. And then turns out

1678
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,480
you can do the same thing and split the

1679
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:20,320
4x4s into 2 x2s. So now each 2x two is

1680
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,800
missing a single cell, but a 2 x two

1681
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:25,199
missing a single cell is just an L. So

1682
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,640
it's all L's. And then we just recombine

1683
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,080
uh reverse what we did before. And now

1684
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,600
we've tiled everything and we're done.

1685
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,190
And that's the algorithm. Thank you so

1686
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:36,560
much.

1687
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:36,560
[Applause]
