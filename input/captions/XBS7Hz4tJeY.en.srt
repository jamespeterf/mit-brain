good morning

33
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,680
everyone it's really an honor to be here

34
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,880
with you today to celebrate the life and

35
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,240
the work of sanjoy mitter with friends

36
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,519
and

37
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,120
colleagues I didn't have the privilege

38
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,440
of knowing sanjoy well like you

39
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,560
do but his warmth and his kindness could

40
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,040
be seen and felt even at a

41
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,959
distance and the inspiration and support

42
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,560
that he provided to students posts and

43
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:44,880
Junior faculty was known well beyond his

44
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,839
research group and Beyond Lids in fact

45
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,279
even way over there in Tech Square where

46
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,120
I was a graduate student in the 1980s

47
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,000
which felt like a different planet from

48
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,000
MIT that's for

49
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,880
sure

50
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,720
um my friend and colleague Petro perona

51
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,680
spent I think one year as a postto with

52
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,079
sanjy that's where I sort of really

53
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,120
first uh had a

54
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,680
close one one distance link and and you

55
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,279
know I think one year in uh San Joy's

56
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,680
group really changed I think Petro's

57
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,000
entire approach as a faculty member and

58
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,920
and not just in a scholarly way but also

59
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,920
uh in sort of you know bringing his own

60
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,560
Humanity to his group uh and you know

61
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,399
Pedro can reflect on that a lot more

62
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,680
eloquently than I can it's his direct

63
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,800
experience but that was something that I

64
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,040
watched happen in somebody I knew

65
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
well so Sandra was not only an

66
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,320
outstanding researcher mentor and

67
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,839
collaborator uh he also really excelled

68
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,120
at building the lids Community serving

69
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,920
as Lids director starting in

70
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,720
1981 and he really broadened the lab's

71
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,399
efforts in information Theory bringing

72
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,880
in uh Robert Gallagher starting a few

73
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,200
years later to serve as co-director

74
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,480
with him between

75
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,680
1986 and

76
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,480
1999 and that led to a period of um

77
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,000
really Dynamic advances in coding

78
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,279
information Theory large scale

79
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,560
statistical inference and estimation

80
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:21,120
where Lids played a really Central role

81
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,480
um and in some ways uh you know it was a

82
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,959
period of a lot of change much like what

83
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,760
we're trying to do with the College of

84
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,800
computing uh in broadening Computing not

85
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,880
just broadening uh what goes was on an

86
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,600
individual uh lab uh at

87
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,600
MIT and under the lead leadership of

88
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,880
sirach there he is I'm going to single

89
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,519
him out for a minute uh Liz is

90
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,480
undergoing another period of broadening

91
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,839
uh with you know new faculty bringing

92
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,240
computational informal methods to bear

93
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,279
on problems in both the physical and the

94
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,000
social worlds and I'm really proud to

95
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,519
have this lab and an exciting me to have

96
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,040
this lab with its long history of

97
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,440
innovation and of periodic reinvention

98
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,480
of the lab's focus and Mission as part

99
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,639
of the schwarzman College of computing

100
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,440
because it's that kind of repeated

101
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,120
invention and Innovation and change that

102
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,279
I certainly hope the college will stand

103
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,279
for 85 years from now uh when we think

104
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,160
about the 85 year history of

105
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
Lids

106
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,800
um with Sandro's nearly two decades at

107
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,680
the Helm of the lab I think it's hard to

108
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,680
argue that anyone else has had a more

109
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,760
positive impact on Lids in its 88 5 year

110
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,480
history so it's really wonderful today

111
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,600
uh that you're organizing this

112
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,800
reflection on sanjoy this celebration of

113
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:46,800
sanjoy and his broad and deep positive

114
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,560
impact on people on science and on

115
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,240
institutions and it's really humbling to

116
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,399
kick off this celebration and

117
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,399

so many familiar faces from Lids and ECS

124
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,480
both past and present some of whom have

125
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,880

not be the last one to point this

150
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,360
straight out today but it Bears

151
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,399
repeating sanjoy was a true scholar um

152
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,160
someone whom I've learned so many things

153
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,199
from he was deeply and profoundly

154
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,959
curious about everyone as much as

155
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:47,279
everything everyone who was lucky enough

156
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,279
uh to know and interact with sanjoy

157
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,320
remembers how he opened conversations so

158
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,880
what are you up to and by that sanjoy

159
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,000
never meant how busy are you or what

160
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,240
important career Milestones have you

161
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,240
achieved he really really meant uh what

162
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,160
are you exploring what have you enjoyed

163
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,000
lately a conversation with sanjoy was

164
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,279
always about what sparked your interest

165
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,120
what questions you had what new

166
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,360
intellectual puzzles uh you were

167
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,399
intrigued by he always wanted to know uh

168
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,320
what the passionate and curious people

169
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,720
around him were excited about and it

170
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,000
shows in almost every picture um and

171
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,600
portrait of sanjo which we have he's

172
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
listening attention full generous and

173
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,600
always accompanied by excellent

174
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,000
open-ended questions and references was

175
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,920
his gift and he offered it freely for

176
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,240
all many of his students and those in

177
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,639
his orbit noted the change in atmosphere

178
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,519
that happened around sanjoy instead of a

179
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,560
high pressure fast-paced sense of frenzy

180
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,279
they were encouraged to take time to

181
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,360
reflect carefully on what they absorbed

182
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:57,240
allowing for time to Foster

183
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,880
understanding ask questions and make

184
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,199
imaginative connections I cannot

185
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,480
emphasize how wonderful and how

186
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:07,560
necessary these reminders to slow down

187
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,199
and think deeply were during my early

188
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,000
years at MIT and I'm not alone Ben

189
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,680
vanroy um a friend U colleague now a

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,519
professor at Stanford beautifully

191
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,040
described lid's calm atmosphere in a

192
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,319
testimonial uh about his time here

193
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,440
saying that the place encourages

194
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,639
students to take time in producing the

195
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,199
best ideas and problem for formulations

196
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,440
and to understand issues in deep

197
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,560
ways around the same time in early 2000s

198
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,519
Tom Richardson wrote I believe the

199
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,639
intellectual atmosphere at Lids was

200
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,519
largely set and maintained by the

201
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,040
director sanjoy met he was continually

202
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,160
reaching out to other areas of

203
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,480
engineering as well as mathematics and

204
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,120
physics in search of interesting and

205
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,440
potentially useful ideas problems and

206
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,480
techniques fellow graduate students

207
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,120
organized at one point a series of

208
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,639
internal lectures in which we would

209
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,639
present to each other interesting things

210
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,600
we learned the this eclectic choice of

211
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,480
topics usually had little to do with our

212
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,240
ongoing research uh or even engineering

213
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,439
per se this effort reflected the desire

214
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,039
many of us shared to grow in bread not

215
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,919
just in depth in retrospect I see that

216
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,880
such an effort was natural within the

217
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,120
atmosphere of Lids at the time so I

218
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,919
think we're sort of emphasizing the same

219
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,559
themes around ld's approach this is

220
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,000
natural but not coincidental sanjoy

221
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,520
fostered the culture of LD deliberately

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,640
choosing to create the kind of

223
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,320
environment that brought out the best in

224
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:40,240
people Petro perona um in a lovely

225
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,120
testimonial which we exerted from San

226
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,760
Joy's obituary wrote that the

227
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,039
intellectual and social atmosphere which

228
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,480
uh that I met in Professor M's group at

229
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,120
LDS was unique and precious wholly new

230
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,400
to me I liken it to the atmosphere of

231
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:59,000
the Renaissance court at its Center the

232
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,480
enlightened Prince sanjy M would provide

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,320
funding inspiration emotional support

234
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,799
and an aesthetic Cannon the courtiers

235
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,200
The Graduate students and post talks

236
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,240
would be given the intellectual Freedom

237
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,559
the encouragement and the resources to

238
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,280
follow their own curiosity and encourage

239
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,120
to work on a diverse array of problems

240
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
again and again we hear the same

241
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
refrains that characterize our

242
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,640
relationships with sanjoy quiet

243
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,840
encouragement to pursue interests

244
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,520
freely a thoughtful approach to

245
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,640
interdisciplinary educ Ed ation before

246
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,720
interdisciplinary education even was a

247
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,760
thing or a term but also done correctly

248
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,880
and deeply and the mentorship that felt

249
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,159
like a wonderful conversation with a

250
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,640
friend I remember that when I was a

251
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,760
graduate student very preoccupied with

252
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,000
my own research and trying to write

253
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,559
papers he always came to my office he

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,440
used to go around uh visiting offices of

255
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,520
all graduate students when he was a

256
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,159
direct when he was the director and told

257
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,240
me you should go to as many talks as you

258
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,039
possibly could

259
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,039
his reasoning was you never know where a

260
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,880
good idea will come from and he was

261
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,200
right sanjoy understood that scholarship

262
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,440
is not one lone genius laboring in

263
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,000
isolation producing publishing endlessly

264
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,320
it requires many curious people sharing

265
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,960
questions and ideas exploring areas of

266
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,280
study far outside their comfort zones

267
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,640
risking vulnerability as we admit

268
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,000
ignorance and um ask for um help that's

269
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,799
exactly the culture sanjo inst instilled

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,039
in LD and which makes me proud to be

271
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,000
part of this wonderful Community a

272
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,880
community consisting of friends pursuing

273
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,320
truly foundational and interesting

274
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,880
questions questions that change over

275
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,760
time but always with the same curiosity

276
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
and desire for a deep understanding

277
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,400
using a diverse set of

278
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,080
approaches friends fuel each other and

279
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,440
our work is better for it but that fuel

280
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,200
is never purely intellectual was not

281
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,400
that way with sanjo in particular we

282
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,039
fuel each other with kindness with

283
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,400
company and with shared meals I was very

284
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,600
uh Lucky had the privilege to attend

285
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,240
number of dinners with sanjoy who was

286
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,280
quite the gastronome and I remember him

287
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,280
saying life is too short for white wine

288
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,039
while raising his glass of

289
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,240
red sanjoy was as always quite correct

290
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,480
but looking around this room I'm struck

291
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,960
that life's brevity is made sweeter not

292
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,200
only by good red wine but equally by Joy

293
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
curiosity and good company I hope that

294
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,679
each and every one of you will take the

295
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,840
time to turn to each other great friends

296
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,280
both old and new and ask each other a

297
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,270
simple yet profoundly important question

298
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:48,309
so what are you up to thank

299
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:48,309
[Applause]

300
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,280
you so now we're going to have Professor

301
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,720
pron of meter this is sano's brother

302
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,000
who's going to tell us U

303
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,000
yeah was going to say a few words

304
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,559
go ahead PK

305
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,200
okay yes please

306
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:26,320
go go ahead PK okay I will

307
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,039
start so my talk is going to be on the

308
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,320
San early years

309
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,120
and the Genesis of his

310
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,400
interests first of all I want to say

311
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,159
that due to unforeseen circumstances I'm

312
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,799
unable to participate physically at this

313
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,520
conference I want to thank all of you

314
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:52,520
who have gathered here to honor my late

315
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,919
late brother djoy I thank the organizers

316
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:59,480
of this conference for giving me the

317
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:01,400
opportunity to say a few words about him

318
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,520
many of you are his

319
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,679
colleagues and friends as well as his

320
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,120
former

321
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,760
students you have known him in his

322
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,640
mature years and can attest as to his

323
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,960
wide range of

324
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,720
interests his office and home was filled

325
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,080
with

326
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,440
books on his professional interests on

327
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,480
mathematics and at home also books on

328
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:34,559
economics sociology

329
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,400
history art and so on as well as novels

330
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,120
in many

331
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,159
languages the coffee table of his Mount

332
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,640
oen Street home was always piled with

333
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:49,799
books which were on his reading list he

334
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,760
was obviously a very cultivated person

335
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:56,760
speaking fluently besides English

336
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:00,080
Italian French and German and of course

337
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,039
his native language

338
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,360
pingori he and his late Italian wife

339
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,480
Adriana maintained a home in Florence

340
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,919
and it has been said that he spoke

341
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,919
Italian with a fartin

342
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:18,120
accent what I want to address here today

343
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,760
is a question of the Genesis of his

344
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,320
diverse

345
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,159
interests and for that we have to go

346
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,640
back to his early years in postc

347
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,960
colonial

348
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:35,080
India the story of his family background

349
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:37,840
is well told in the obit MIT obit his

350
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,039
father who died young was electrical

351
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,600
engineer and Sano was to follow later in

352
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,360
his footsteps he left so Sano father

353
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,600
left a library of books which Sano

354
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,480
inherited mostly on mathematics as well

355
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,520
as notebooks filled with calculations

356
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,559
which her mother had

357
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,120
preserved amongst the books I want to

358
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,240
two which sanoy must have read there was

359
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,120
a book of calculus written by an

360
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,120
electrical engineer at the turn of the

361
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,840
20th centur at the beginning of the 20th

362
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,880
century where you were taught to

363
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,640
calculate as Newton must have done with

364
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,840
power series for good function but no

365
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,240
but with no proofs

366
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,200
whatsoever learn to calculate and proofs

367
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,360
will

368
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,039
follow the other book also by an

369
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,279
engineer was in F series but dealt with

370
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,360
in a very sophisticated way and this

371
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,840
time with proofs including the fact that

372
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,760
the F series doesn't always converge for

373
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,000
all continuous functions and examples

374
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,640
due to

375
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:50,039
V this must have

376
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,039
left a profound impression on my

377
00:25:51,559 --> 00:26:00,279
brother between the ages of 16 and 18

378
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:03,399
and 20 sanj was a Unity of Kolkata where

379
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:06,159
he took his first degree in

380
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:09,240
mathematics the early postcolonial years

381
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:13,039
of Kolkata were those of intellectual

382
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,360
ferment San had his classmates many of

383
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,279
whom would become well known as

384
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,799
economists and

385
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,480
historians amongst them was his very

386
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,320
close friend the E colist Economist

387
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,880
sukar chakravarti who was later close to

388
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,679
Samuelson and solo at M

389
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,279
sanjo and his friend who had anic

390
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:39,960
knowledge engaged in discussion in pure

391
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:43,880
mathematics logic economics history

392
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,200
novels Etc all this was in his Kolkata

393
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,279
years before he went to

394
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,399
England to become an electrical engineer

395
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,760
in his

396
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:56,960
turn I inherited my brother's library

397
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,159
and also found books on poetry and I

398
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,559
here I speak of the French symbolists

399
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,200
and German Romantic Poets of the 19th

400
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:08,600
century novels by Thomas V and so

401
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,440
on all this was a translation of course

402
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,880
but later when he he had mastered many

403
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,880
of these languages he was to read some

404
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,640
of these books in the

405
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,240
original so you see here the roots of

406
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,279
sano's intellectual

407
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,200
interests after these formative kak

408
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,600
years he went to England where he was in

409
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,760
engineering school of the Imperial

410
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,559
College after his first degree in

411
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,960
electrical engineering he went to

412
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:41,799
Switzerland where he worked as actually

413
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:45,039
as an engineer at Brown B near

414
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,880
cich it was there that he mastered

415
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,799
German after his SN as an engineer in

416
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,600
cich he went to work in Geneva as an

417
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,039
engineer where he mastered French he had

418
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,880
a private French tutor and he once

419
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:02,480
showed me proudly The Notebook he kept

420
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,080
where he did the grammar exercises quite

421
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,200
methodically as you know from his obit

422
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,640
he then went back to Imperial College

423
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,120
for his PhD then to the US first at Case

424
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,480
Western Reserve and Hereafter for the

425
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,720
rest of his career and life at

426
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,240
MIT the speakers who follow will talk

427
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,320
about many aspects of San's work at LS

428
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,440
and at the center for the study of

429
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,799
intelligent control systems of which he

430
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,320
was a co-founder

431
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,960
on my part I would like to close by

432
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,760
saying a few words about San's deep

433
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,679
mathematical interest he was not a

434
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,320
calculation

435
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,919
man although he could calculations when

436
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,120
necessary his 4y was in his

437
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,720
comprehension of deep mathematical

438
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,159
Concepts which permeates his work I will

439
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,960
site as a mathematical physicist a

440
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,799
sample of some papers of Sano and

441
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,799
collaborators which show this there are

442
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:05,279
for example his papers with Nal Newton

443
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,399
on a variational approach to nonlinear

444
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,399
estimation their papers on the calan buy

445
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,559
filter and entropy flow this work I'm

446
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,559
reminded is close to the variational

447
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,120
formulation of non-equilibrium

448
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,760
statistical mechanics due to jonan and

449
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,720
collaborators which deal with

450
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,320
macroscopic fluctuation of

451
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,360
non-equilibrium stationary States and

452
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,039
produces a hydrodynamic like equation

453
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,960
for the

454
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,039
fluctuation another people which I like

455
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,919
to which I would like to site as an

456
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,679
example is that with the Princeton

457
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,039
mathematician Charles feferman and oppos

458
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:47,000
do Har Nar on testing the manifold

459
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,919
hypothesis which states that big data

460
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,200
tend to concentrate around low

461
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,440
dimensional sub manifolds as some

462
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,679
sufficient at of some sufficiently high

463
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,640
ukan space in this paper they produce

464
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,320
algorith

465
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,200
to test the hypothesis there are no

466
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,399
doubt many other examples which you

467
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,919
would know better than me with them with

468
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,640
these remarks I end my reflection and

469
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,640
thank all of you for listening to

470
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:20,059
[Applause]

471
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,960
me thank you panov and I guess now we'll

472
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,960
start with the speaker with the panel

473
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,240
I think I'll do the same

474
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,320
I

475
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,519
think I was going to start this off is

476
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,360
this mic

477
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:18,480
on yeah okay Shila if you could put up

478
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,480
the slides of mine

479
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:25,080
yeah I was asked to moderate this uh

480
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,799
session my name is George verges uh and

481
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,880
we'll get a slide up now to show you who

482
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:36,480
else is on this oh there we go

483
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:40,039
um so I'm with MIT and I'll tell you a

484
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,919
little bit more about um my story here

485
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:46,399
as I talk about sanjoy um and we have

486
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:49,039
Alan wilsky Peter FAL Jose mura Maxim

487
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,360
rinsky and I'll leave them to introduce

488
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,240
themselves as uh their turns come up uh

489
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,840
so maybe we can do I have a clicker for

490
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,840
the is it

491
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,240
yeah I tried the green button there we

492
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,240
go okay uh so I first

493
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,240
um went back

494
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:35,519
um I first heard about sanjoy when I was

495
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:38,159
um doing my doctoral work at Stanford

496
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,840
and the work I heard about was what he

497
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,679
did with his first PhD student at Case

498
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,600
Western and the Simon mitter work is

499
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,679
very well known uh

500
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,880
1968 this was his uh he joined case

501
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,840
Weston around 1965 and this was his

502
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,919
first uh PhD student um and I ended up

503
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,440
writing a paper that that had some of

504
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,080
the same themes it was about modal

505
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,919
control of uh State Space Systems as I

506
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,600
look back on that paper I see that

507
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:12,799
sanj's work was so well embedded that

508
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,960
all my references are to uh secondary

509
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,960
sources after sanjoy after the mitter um

510
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,000
uh Simon work uh so but it's a beautiful

511
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,799
paper and I've reread it uh recently so

512
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,440
this was where I first heard about

513
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,880
Sunjoy um and then he had a very direct

514
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,279
impact on my coming to MIT because he's

515
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,159
the one who told my thesis adviser Tom

516
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,519
kyot that there was a position being

517
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,320
advertised in the electric power systems

518
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,320
engineering lab and they wanted someone

519
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,399
who could do systems and control things

520
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,240
in the context of Power Systems uh so I

521
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,760
gave it a shot came and interviewed and

522
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,399
it was actually sanjoy Telling Tom kyot

523
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,720
that I'd actually got the uh position

524
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,240
that's how I first heard from it started

525
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,000
with sanjy

526
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,000
um I came to a different lab than Lids

527
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,039
so I always had one foot in Lids uh but

528
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,399
sanjoy was kind of a guiding spirit and

529
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,639
guardian angel as you'll hear from many

530
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:15,919
people uh throughout my uh career at

531
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,440
MIT I remember him at the time I was

532
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,200
coming up for tenure um collaborating

533
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,280
with Fred schwee to advance my case and

534
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,399
I think he he never told me that I

535
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,520
shouldn't be doing something I'm doing

536
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,159
or that I should focus on something else

537
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,079
but he was concerned that I had one foot

538
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,040
in each of two labs and he didn't want

539
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:38,639
me to fall through the crack so he spent

540
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,200
some time trying to find a handle for me

541
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,679
as he put it uh that he could something

542
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,679
he could use to describe me to other

543
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:50,000
people anyway um whatever he did worked

544
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:52,919
and I uh stayed um and so we went

545
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,679
through many years uh these are pictures

546
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:59,640
from a party um after I'd been here 31.4

547
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,240
years so that's why ppai um my students

548
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,599
on a post at that time Thomas held

549
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,520
decided to throw me a party you see

550
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,200
Sunjoy there and also another dear

551
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,800
colleague whom we lost uh very recently

552
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,359
Arvin

553
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,320
um and for the rest I'm going to hand

554
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,079
over to my colleagues here to fill in

555
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,920
the picture and then I'll come back to

556
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,359
what else I had on my slides so Alan

557
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,359
sure oh you have your own

558
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:39,000
okay uh first it's uh really nice to be

559
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,839
on this panel with uh people to pick up

560
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
on things that uh uh gone up for many

561
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:50,520
years I renewed my technical discussions

562
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,520
with Peter phal on wine um and uh great

563
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,319
to see George and somebody who says that

564
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,680
he's Jose mura um when we were graduate

565
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,960
student students to together and then

566
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,640
when I was in a thesis committee Jose

567
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,560
had Rastafarian hair if you remember

568
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,960
Rose Ro remember uh Rowan Martin's uh

569
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:17,200
laugh in he looked like Father Guido

570
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:20,400
Sarducci who are you U so so uh my

571
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,599
memory of sanjoy goes back to my senior

572
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,560
year as an undergrad here in course 16

573
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,319
uh when i' taken a course on function

574
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,280
optimization from Wally vandery which

575
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,720
included discussion a variety of methods

576
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,079
and I voraciously read things including

577
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,079
a paper on the conjugate gradian method

578
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,839
uh co-author by sanjoy so I think I'm

579
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,839
the only one here who attended his job

580
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,240
talk when he applied uh for the position

581
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:50,000
um at

582
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,319
MIT uh after uh that the summer that

583
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,520
followed U I had a great job at Bell

584
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,599
labs and my my the people I worked with

585
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,720
there urged me to go talk to Roger

586
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,680
rocket who just moved up to to Harvard

587
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,440
um and I did that and Roger said I

588
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,240
needed to talk to two people at MIT one

589
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,680
of them Yan Williams was on sabatical

590
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,240
the other was Sandro uh and Sandro

591
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,119
became the only member of what was then

592
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,560
the E Department uh on my thesis

593
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,079
committee and I split my time between

594
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,720
hanging out with John Baris and others

595
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,920
in Rogers Group uh and building 35 with

596
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,400
the students of Mike Athens Yan Williams

597
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Lenny Gould and Sandro uh a second thing

598
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,520
about about Sandro being on my committee

599
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,640
uh I wrote a really long thesis

600
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,480
something that I I prayed that none of

601
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,680
my students would inflict on me and this

602
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,480
was at a time where I hand wrote it um

603
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,560
and then would hand it off to to a word

604
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,280
processor that is a technical typist uh

605
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,240
who would uh use things called rubons

606
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,960
now now if you're not familiar with rub

607
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:06,000
on what rubons are you can ask my wife

608
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,680
who uh was before she launched her um

609
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,400
her career as a children's book uh

610
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,800
illustrator worked as a technical typist

611
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:19,079
and for some reason loved to do rubons

612
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,680
um uh I should say that um uh uh I can't

613
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,359
say that i' look at this badly but I

614
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,000
know there's at least one person here

615
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:30,000
and I'm thinking of you love vne who has

616
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,920
more books with my wife's name on The

617
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,960
Spine and

618
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,960
mine sanre scholarship which everybody's

619
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,440
talked about his it was just

620
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,560
extraordinary and as muner talked about

621
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,560
last night I would go in and the

622
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,880
conversations would go everywhere uh I

623
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,839
remember particular uh him pointing out

624
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,520
a couple of papers by Lowden slogger and

625
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:57,119
helson I was working on estimation on

626
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,400
groups both Lee and finite and uh I

627
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,520
looked at that work up and you think of

628
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,560
X of t for me the group was where X

629
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,280
lived for Lon Slugger and helson T was

630
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,160
the thing where the group lived and that

631
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,800
came back to roost for me when I started

632
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,079
moving into random fields and graphical

633
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,280
models there were two times when I met

634
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,359
with sandj where I have to admit I was

635
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,760
distracted the first time we're sitting

636
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,760
there and sandj was sitting back and

637
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,319
gesticulating about things and all of a

638
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:31,480
sudden he knows there's a hole in his

639
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:34,359
shirt why was there a hole in his

640
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,040
shirt I found out a few weeks later when

641
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:39,240
I was in there and he was smoking a

642
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,280
cigarette just gesticulating with it and

643
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,880
this particular occasion the ashes did

644
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,920
not fall on his shirt they fell on the

645
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:51,480
ground but sanjoy on occasion would burn

646
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,760
holes into his shirt uh I will say that

647
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,400
Sandro gave me one of the quotes that

648
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,160
I've used most in actually the most

649
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,640
important uh lectures I've given uh it's

650
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,920
by 1960 Nobel laas Peter medir which

651
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,119
really speaks profoundly to the

652
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,560
importance of creativity and really

653
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,480
important research and that was defining

654
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,319
science as the art of the

655
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,040
solvable uh and sanjoy had read meir's

656
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,599
papers which are an astounding thing to

657
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,720
read not as technical papers but as ones

658
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,599
on uh philosophy of

659
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,920
science uh has also been mentioned

660
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,720
sanjoy had Mastery of of a number of

661
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,920
languages is what some of you may not

662
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,040
know is he also translated books uh and

663
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,760
the most famous one that he translated

664
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,680
was JL Leon's book on infinite

665
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,280
dimensional systems uh a real

666
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,960
Masterpiece Leon at this time was the

667
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,400
president of what was then called Ira

668
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:53,000
they hadn't added yet the N for National

669
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,040
on that uh and uh I remember picking up

670
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,160
an issue of the Siam news which was

671
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:03,400
distributed and it had an advertisement

672
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,599
for this book by J Leon uh translated by

673
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,599
San Joy mitter talking about the

674
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,400
generalizations of various things

675
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,079
including the generalization of the

676
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:20,079
celebrated Capital bu

677
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:22,319
U lowercase k a l m an filter now Sandro

678
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,040
had a pretty good relationship with Rudy

679
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,920
but he received incredible amount of

680
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,040
grief from from Rudy uh on this that's

681
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,599
only one of two occasions in which I

682
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,880
know he came out rather flustered from

683
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,359
dealing with cman the other was uh

684
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,160
Rudyard at some point calman decided the

685
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:42,480
only way he was going to win the Nobel

686
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,000
Prize was to switch into

687
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,839
economics um um and he came to give a

688
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,680
lecture as it turned out the lecture was

689
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:53,960
one of of U Reinventing total Le squares

690
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,960
uh but Rudy wanted to the to to attract

691
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,839
economists and the one he wanted to

692
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,520
attract was John Von man's daughter uh

693
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:04,079
Marina van noyman Witman uh who wasn't

694
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,760
up in the Cambridge area but I believe

695
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,359
she was on sabatical at Harvard and Rudy

696
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,319
insisted sanjoy call her and sanjoy

697
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:14,000
walked into my office after this with

698
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,800
the looks the only time I've seen a look

699
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,680
on his face that looks somewhat

700
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,040
flustered and dazed cuz Rudy said I want

701
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
you to call her up and once you get her

702
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,520
on the phone I'm going to take the phone

703
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,480
away from you and I'm going to sweep her

704
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,960
off her feet verbally and she'll be

705
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,200
dazzled and come to my talk and agree

706
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,480
that I've reinvented economics for for

707
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,480
fortunately fortunately um San only got

708
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,800
an assistant who said that Dr Whitman

709
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,800
was

710
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,280
unavailable food and wine uh in 1975 I

711
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,680
had good taste for California wines but

712
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,160
I frankly I didn't know a whole lot

713
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,920
about French Wines in 75 um my first

714
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,400
doctoral student Steve Marcus and I uh

715
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,319
went to Paris and then we're going to

716
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,520
meet up again with sanjoy at UD for a

717
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:06,440
really interesting Symposium on

718
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,200
algebraic System Theory and uh sanjoy

719
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,400
told Steve he was going to complete his

720
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,400
education as it was he completed my

721
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,359
education as well he took us to allar a

722
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,680
one-star restaurant in the Latin quarter

723
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:23,480
and the food was excellent but what blew

724
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,559
me away is my first gron crew burgundy

725
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,839
cloar um and i' I've actually discussed

726
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:33,319
this with porob several times um uh it

727
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,040
was wonderful wine five years later in

728
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:38,480
1980 when I had a sabatical in Paris

729
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,400
Susanna and I took my host Michelle

730
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,040
fleece out for dinner at alar and it was

731
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,440
a one-page m mograph menu which just had

732
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,079
a couple

733
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:54,680
of good but not gr Crew wines listed and

734
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:57,400
so uh when the waiter come over I said

735
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:02,240
AVU clar

736
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:06,599
and he stepped back and he said

737
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:09,280
FL we and for the rest of the meal he

738
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,319
insisted on calling you miss

739
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,319
presid and he cracked jokes only some of

740
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,200
which I got in my limited French one of

741
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:18,640
which was telling us that the mineral

742
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,880
water he was serving was us was from an

743
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,160
excellent

744
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,079
vintage thanks sanjoy all right

745
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,280
Athletics something that's not been

746
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,280
talked about with sanjy u in several

747
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:35,559
stories about this first is in 1978 the

748
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,720
Red Sox uh uh had a crushing loss in the

749
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,599
onegame playoff with the Yankees which

750
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,079
eliminated them and vaulted the Yankees

751
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,359
into the World

752
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:47,960
Series uh it came in the next day an ran

753
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:50,440
to sand joy and he said how could they

754
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,559
let Bucky Dent hit a home run to beat

755
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,599
them sanjoy followed the Red

756
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,480
Sox uh but the other the other

757
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,839
uh athletic stories I have to tell I

758
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:06,839
have to talk about um lid's answer to

759
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,359
Felix uner and Oscar Madison of The Odd

760
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:11,680
Couple that was sanjy mitter and Yan

761
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,319
Willams uh the first is one where

762
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,240
there's only one other person here who

763
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,200
who participated in this and that was

764
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,880
John uh Roger asked me to organize a

765
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,599
soccer game between the Harvard group

766
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,160
and uh the MIT group I I played on The

767
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,800
Winning Side John didn't

768
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,079
um uh and and the the The Odd Couple was

769
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,559
there and there was sanjoy in his

770
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,920
dazzling white shirt and shorts looking

771
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,520
like he was ready to play for the India

772
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,480
field hockey team and he'd make these

773
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,640
wonderful rushes down the right sideline

774
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,640
with beautiful centering passes at least

775
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:55,200
one or two of which led to goals and his

776
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,319
form was

777
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,880
perfect secondly Steve Marcus and I when

778
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,680
we were both graduate students played

779
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:06,079
doubles tennis with sanjy and Yan and

780
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,720
sanre was there in his dazzlingly white

781
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,880
shirt and shorts contrasting

782
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:17,079
dramatically with his skin tone and his

783
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:19,440
form on his ground strokes was perfect

784
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:21,760
in contrast in both of these things for

785
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,920
the for the soccer game Yan spent the

786
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,480
game running around telling people what

787
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,000
to do and directing them and complaining

788
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,079
in the in the tennis match it appeared

789
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,880
that yam was engaged in a form of

790
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,000
performance art best described as

791
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,920
executing a space filling curve while

792
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,319
holding a tennis racket it was quite an

793
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,359
experience with them uh one more Yan and

794
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:49,400
Sandro story um uh there was one year in

795
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:52,440
which uh uh Sandro and yam were team

796
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,559
teaching a course on algebraic System

797
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,440
Theory of course I inherited and took on

798
00:46:54,559 --> 00:47:00,640
after that using a very

799
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:05,520
peculiar book written by Rudy calman

800
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:08,280
Michael ARB and Peter FAL uh and uh one

801
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,839
day sanjo is giving the lecture and Yan

802
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,480
see Marcus is the one who relay the

803
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,960
story to me he's sitting next to Jan and

804
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,880
as M sort of described you know Sano is

805
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,040
is an extraordinary in some ways as a

806
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,359
teacher he go to the board and he wrote

807
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,680
the word theorem and underl it and put

808
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,559
it a colon typically then he would give

809
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,240
the incredible history intellectual and

810
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,400
conceptual history of how what he was

811
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,559
going to do related to things broadly in

812
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,119
the field really remarkable then he'd

813
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,880
write the theorem

814
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,520
statement uh and then uh he might add

815
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,520
some more comments at that point then

816
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,480
he'd very carefully write the word proof

817
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,920
and underline it then put a colon in

818
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,119
after it and all of this his board

819
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,559
Technic and his

820
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:59,640
handwriting were perfect it was not

821
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,200
however wearing blindingly white

822
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,599
athletic shirt and shorts um and then

823
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,640
Sano we'd walk over to the far corner of

824
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,920
the board on the bottom put a little

825
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,559
square in and fill it in where the proof

826
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,559
would end and quite frequently after

827
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:16,200
that all hell would break

828
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:19,119
loose and he end it with the w the

829
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Whimsical smile sanj could could always

830
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,280
put on saying well this is a research

831
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,079
seminar isn't it now on this occasion in

832
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,160
this course Sandra was lecturing and and

833
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:32,800
Steve all as SRE is going through all of

834
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:35,640
this Steve realizes that Yan is writing

835
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,440
furiously with his hand raised and sanoy

836
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,160
finally recognized him Yan said would

837
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,559
you like the counter example to the

838
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:47,160
theorem before or after you prove

839
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:51,280
it sanoy chose

840
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,640
after now four um uh professional things

841
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,359
uh not humorous but ones that actually

842
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,319
mean a considerable amount to me uh the

843
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:00,200
first is the center for intelligent

844
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,640
Control Systems we were talking about

845
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:06,520
this last night I mean uh sanjoy was the

846
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,839
the the the originator of this idea

847
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,640
brought in people from Harvard and

848
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:14,559
people from brown people wonderful

849
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,960
Scholars from all ranging from ol Gander

850
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,359
at Brown to Roger Brock at Harvard just

851
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,680
an extraordinary group and it was one

852
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:25,559
where the vision was lofty what we were

853
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,799
going to do and we were fortunate enough

854
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,839
to have a sponsor who allowed us to

855
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:34,079
pursue that for a number of years and it

856
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:38,079
became a magnet for work around the

857
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,839
world uh it provided support for many

858
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,359
many students for many faculty

859
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:46,319
especially Junior faculty uh and for

860
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,880
wonderful post STS and Sandro deserves

861
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:51,760
all the credit for

862
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:54,640
that second was um I was um off at an

863
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,480
Air Force scientific Advisory Board um

864
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,440
Retreat uh at the Beckman Center in UC

865
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,440
Irvine and I received an email for

866
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,920
sanjoy saying there's a mury topic

867
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,440
coming out on sensor networks we should

868
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,359
bid it um and so I joined San sanoy on

869
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,040
this who again in his typical fashion

870
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:14,680
brought in in this case uh guys from

871
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,920
Princeton uh sanie Carney and Sergio

872
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:20,760
overdue uh and we won the won the

873
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,720
proposal uh but at the

874
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:27,720
opening the opening seminar we gave to

875
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:30,839
our sponsors it was clear that the Army

876
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,119
audience wasn't really interested in San

877
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:36,319
Joy's lofty

878
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:40,440
view so sanjoy asked me to take this

879
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:43,319
over and we never sacrificed that view

880
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,440
but I will tell you every single uh

881
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:48,520
review meeting we had my presentation at

882
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,160
the start was like a game of Twister

883
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,119
where you have to put your arms and feet

884
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,119
in various places trying to to to

885
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,839
maintain this lofty Vision by showing

886
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,440
but also showing things that the Army

887
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:03,079
was interested in by the end of the

888
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,839
project our our monitor uh used this as

889
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,599
the Exemplar of what good good M muy

890
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,119
should

891
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:15,240
be uh the third what occurred in began

892
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:21,319
in 2007 when um the future existence was

893
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:24,559
of Lids was under serious threat um and

894
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:26,640
um I'd always said that I never wanted

895
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:31,119
to be in charge of a group of people

896
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:34,400
people like myself or like any of you U

897
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:38,680
uh and or but the their job fell to me

898
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:42,559
to be director um at a very troubling

899
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,400
time uh but all of the faculty uh

900
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,040
pitched in incredibly and there were

901
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,839
three individuals who were

902
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,839
extraordinarily important to this muner

903
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,400
dala and John CES for um their

904
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,880
leadership and sanjoy who was mostly

905
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,000
behind the scenes but pushing what Lids

906
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:04,280
had been and should be going well into

907
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,880
the future um and was an incredible

908
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:11,839
source of uh of

909
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:15,079
uh of gratitude for me to have sanjoy

910
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,920
doing that and we did did

911
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:22,000
okay and look at Lids now it's quite

912
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,920
something finally uh fourth one as some

913
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,319
of you know a number of years ago I was

914
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,520
uh elected to National Academy of

915
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:32,839
engineering and you're not supposed to

916
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:36,839
know who it was who nominated you or any

917
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:39,760
of that process okay but I'm pretty sure

918
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:42,760
that sanjoy was involved in that and

919
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:47,119
that's not surp surprising sanjoy

920
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,359
championed all of us again and again and

921
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,559
these are not trivial jobs to do if

922
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,720
you're going to write a nomination or

923
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,680

everyone uh in

1011
00:57:54,839 --> 00:58:01,680
fact in all the years I've known him I

1012

never knew him to lose his temper now

1013
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,880
I'm sure he did at some point but but

1014
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:11,839
never uh in my

1015
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:15,240
presence there's another head of the

1016
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,839
Charles uh which if you are around at

1017
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,839
the time is something very worthwhile to

1018
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:25,200
go to uh Adriana would bring down some

1019
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:28,440
things Sandra would bring a wine and we

1020
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,559
would bring various stuff

1021
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:35,119
now all right this is a

1022
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:39,480
Christmas and this is a Chinese

1023
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:42,520
gentleman Yang Yang we acted my wife and

1024
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:46,079
I as host family to students at

1025
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:49,599
Harvard he was a George Mason fellow he

1026
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:54,280
was about 40 at the time at the Kennedy

1027
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:57,200
School he was a deputy Minister for

1028
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,000
development uh he had been a translator

1029
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,440
for dong shiao

1030
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,559
ping his English was far better than

1031
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:09,000
mine no and

1032
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:12,440
well if you're a translator for the

1033
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,240
head uh of the Chinese government you

1034
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:17,799
better not make a

1035
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:22,000
mistake now the reason I have this slide

1036
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:24,200
aside from uh CH Sandro and US keeping

1037
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,880
uh Pace with

1038
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:30,160
him uh is

1039
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,559
that towards the end of his Fellowship

1040
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,960
his wife had come over she was a surgeon

1041
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:37,960
and the daughter of a real General

1042
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,240
somebody who had been in the Long March

1043
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:44,640
but was a general not a political

1044
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:49,240
General and at about the time he was to

1045
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:53,119
return to China tenanan Square took

1046
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:57,520
place and he decided that it would be

1047
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:01,799
better to stay here for a while

1048
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:03,640
uh and I had offered him a job uh in a

1049
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:06,720
company I was connected

1050
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:10,599
with which he graciously

1051
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:14,160
refused uh his wife worked as a waitress

1052
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:18,119
in a Chinese restaurant till the coast

1053
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:21,599
was clear but the point I want to make

1054
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:24,200
is that Sandra and I lived Our Lives as

1055
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,520
many of you have in a period of freedom

1056
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,079
and prosperity

1057
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:34,359
and these are pretty fragile

1058
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:34,359
things and uh sanjy knew

1059
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:45,359
it uh this is a another

1060
01:00:40,359 --> 01:00:49,200
Christmas uh showing that that he really

1061
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:51,839
participated as a family member

1062
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,640
now on the

1063
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:56,960
right uh this was on the

1064
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:01,039
cape is

1065
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:04,079
uh a great friend of sandice and mine a

1066
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:08,640
member of the so-called Club of 34 this

1067
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:10,880
was a group of people born in 1934 who

1068
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,920
were active in the

1069
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,920
field uh that's George

1070
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:22,400
zames uh who died

1071
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:27,039
prematurely uh when George was in his

1072
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:29,200
final illness sanjy suggested

1073
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:33,799
that we fly up to

1074
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:35,079
Montreal to see George in the hospital

1075
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:38,079
we

1076
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:38,079
did

1077
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,440
and

1078
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:49,119
George he could understand us but he he

1079
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,480
couldn't communicate he had brain tumor

1080
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,680
I mean sort of out of nowhere he said a

1081
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:57,079
prime

1082
01:01:52,680 --> 01:02:00,720
number and it was very sad

1083
01:01:57,079 --> 01:02:04,000
and I was flying back on the plane and I

1084
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,480
was very sad depressed and

1085
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,200
suddenly an image of George because he

1086
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:15,559
and his family would spend the week on

1087
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:18,760
the cape at a uh motel by the Sea an

1088
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:22,359
image of George leaping out of the

1089
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:25,920
surf with a big smile on his face and I

1090
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:28,680
see the picture still in my mind's eye

1091
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:31,319
and that's the way I choose to remember

1092
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:35,279
George and I will at the end tell you

1093
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:35,279
how I choose to remember sand

1094
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:45,720
Joy uh this is another

1095
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:48,319
Christmas uh he and Adriana brought many

1096
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:52,599
presents to our

1097
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:54,839

1098
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:57,559
Indian and Italian

1099
01:02:54,839 --> 01:03:01,799
dolls so the girls have quite a

1100
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:04,440
collection of them uh here uh Allan

1101
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:09,079
mentioned his athletic prowess by the

1102
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:11,160
way uh he was a superb pingpong player I

1103
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:15,119
don't think he had the dazzling white

1104
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:18,880
shirt at that time but there he is at a

1105
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:23,960

1108
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:34,279
daughter uh encouraging her to some

1109
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:37,680
reading I I assume it was

1110
01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:40,720
probably uh a novel by his friend van

1111
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,960
rori who was a Romanian novelist who

1112
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,960
lived in

1113
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,720
Italy uh in fact he he has a a picture

1114
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:53,200
which is of an

1115
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:55,839
rori uh and uh he encouraged me to read

1116
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,839
him there we are at another Christmas

1117
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:01,839
dinner now the point of this you will

1118
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:07,200
see a salad bowl in there and I've

1119
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:10,079
called this uh maybe it's in the next

1120
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:14,799
slide no that's Halloween I I don't know

1121
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:20,480
how to go back so anyway

1122
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:24,640
but uh some reading okay the thank you

1123
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,760
that we call Adriana's salad now sanjy

1124
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,920
of course would bring some fine wine

1125
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,000
either a Brunello once in a while a

1126
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:36,400
Baro and

1127
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:41,160
occasionally a special

1128
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:44,240
graa sasaya graa but Adriana would

1129
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:49,160
always bring this salad

1130
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:53,799
now it contained Italian greens real

1131
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:55,760
pruto provolone peino but especially

1132
01:04:53,799 --> 01:05:00,440
fresh figs

1133
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,440
it was known for the special fresh

1134
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:07,319
figs that's

1135
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:10,640
Halloween Sandro again as you can see

1136
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:14,920
really a true Uncle this is at a

1137
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:17,760
conference uh and of course you all know

1138
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,839
that there was hardly an important

1139
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,640
conference that he didn't attend frankly

1140
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:27,640
I don't know who the fellow in the

1141
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,640
middle is if somebody does tell them

1142
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:34,400
now here again is my daughter a bit

1143
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,640
older with Carl

1144
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,160
Asam and sand

1145
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:44,799
joy and

1146
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,799
finally this is a family

1147
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,480
picture at my younger daughter's wedding

1148
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:52,680
on Martha's

1149
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:57,880
Vineyard and you can see

1150
01:05:52,680 --> 01:06:02,200
prominently is uncle sand

1151
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:07,640
Joy now the way I remember

1152
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:11,640
him is not as a brilliant scholar not as

1153
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:16,440
somebody that on these dinners we would

1154
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:18,720
discuss oh a vast array of topics

1155
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:23,520
economics uh

1156
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:26,640
history Italian politics Indian

1157
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:29,839
politics a whole range of subjects we

1158
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:32,200
did not discuss technical matters

1159
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,400
because there were ladies

1160
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,440
present

1161
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,720
so but

1162
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:44,400
anyway at the end of an excellent dinner

1163
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:47,400
fine wine we'd have a little after

1164
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,079
dinner drink and a small glass a cognac

1165
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,200
an

1166
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:55,039
armanac once in a while a special graer

1167
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,039
and you know the glass would be empty

1168
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:00,400
we' said would you like a little more

1169
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:03,000
sandre and he was just a

1170
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:08,520
drop with that

1171
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:12,119
gesture and he would finish it and then

1172
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:14,000
oh after about 15 20 minutes say time to

1173
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:15,839
make a

1174
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,400
move

1175
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:20,599
and you know after a wonderful dinner

1176
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,720
great

1177
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:27,760
conversation there's a kind of

1178
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,839
contentment and sand I had an expression

1179
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,079
of

1180
01:07:28,839 --> 01:07:34,760
contentment and that's the way I'll

1181
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:38,760
choose to remember him just a

1182
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,760
drop time to make a

1183
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:49,709
[Applause]

1184
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,960
move well

1185
01:07:56,279 --> 01:08:01,920
thank you Ali and Pablo for organizing

1186
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:05,119
this tribute to S Joy thank you George

1187
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,119
for having me in your

1188
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:13,240
panel of course uh I've known s Joy I

1189
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:17,839
think for all my life and if it's not

1190
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:19,600
all my life is close to it and um s Joy

1191
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:23,520
was of course my

1192
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:26,359
professor was a mentor was a

1193
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,000
colleague and was a friend friend of me

1194
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:29,560
a friend of my family a friend of

1195
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,159
Manuela my

1196
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:37,640
wife and of my kids Barbara Andre and

1197
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:43,480
Pedro we all had lots of times with sjy

1198
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:43,480
and Adriana and uh lately with

1199
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:51,120
Rea so my first class with uh s Joy was

1200
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:53,199
Advanced topics in linear

1201
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,120
system and

1202
01:08:53,199 --> 01:09:00,159
um it was not

1203
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:03,080
like Ellen explained that he would write

1204
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:06,319
the theorum and the proof he wouldn't

1205
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:09,359
even D to do that it was all reading

1206
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,880
papers and uh not even reading papers

1207
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:15,679
because he would invite the authors to

1208
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:18,239
come and present the work and the poor

1209
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:21,679
authors would come and these were the

1210
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:25,799
people that now maybe Peter also showed

1211
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,600
up once that like 50 years later we know

1212
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:29,440
oh these are the gods of systems and

1213
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,400
linear systems but these poor people

1214
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:35,120
would come to present their paper they

1215
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,600
couldn't go beyond the title because

1216
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,480
once they start talking sjy would

1217
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:44,080
interrupt and start with the big

1218
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,239
questions and uh and that was it uh

1219
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:50,880
there was no more talk there was nothing

1220
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:53,199
else and it was just a discussion of why

1221
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,080
didn't they do this rather than doing

1222
01:09:53,199 --> 01:10:00,199
what they had done so so that was my

1223
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:03,640
first uh uh course with sjy and I had to

1224
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:06,719
write the paper and uh I picked or and

1225
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:09,719
joy picked for me papers on what's

1226
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:12,800
called then geometric control by Steve

1227
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,920
Morris and uh one them they had written

1228
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,960
some beautiful papers and uh I had to

1229
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:21,440
learn all that then and joy maybe a few

1230
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,120
few months or a year later was on my

1231
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,880
area exam I don't know if MIT still has

1232
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:30,280
an area exam but at the time you'd need

1233
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,560
to pick papers and then write and I

1234
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,480
picked papers on the stochastic

1235
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:38,159
realization which was a topic emerging

1236
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:40,960
at the time and one of the papers was by

1237
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:43,560
winner and mazani um on linear

1238
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:47,280
prediction and uh I was trying to read

1239
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:49,600
it again coming here and I must tell you

1240
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,880
I couldn't understand anything and I

1241
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:57,320
don't know how I wrote and had s jooy

1242
01:10:52,880 --> 01:11:01,040
then uh quiz me for one hour or so and

1243
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:03,960
the last course was um a course that

1244
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:07,199
Professor Timothy Johnson was giving on

1245
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:09,480
distributed control for systems uh

1246
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:12,320
described by partial differential

1247
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:17,040
equations and again this was typical s

1248
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:19,520
Joy so Tim was the professor in charge

1249
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,000
but because the topic was so relevant

1250
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,080
alen and all the faculty at leads were

1251
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,600
were like with the student sitting in

1252
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:31,719
the audience now guess what Timothy

1253
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,760
would start and

1254
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:38,320
immediately one of them maybe alen or S

1255
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:45,520
Joy or or Yan Williams would

1256
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:48,960
start uh saying whatever else and again

1257
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,679
Timothy would kind of sit down relax and

1258
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:53,840
let them give the lecture which of

1259
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:56,960
course was no lecture and we students

1260
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,159
would stand there and and try to pick up

1261
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,440
the balls as they flew from one side to

1262
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:06,199
the other but even before I met s joy in

1263
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:10,800
the classroom I had already heard a lot

1264
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:13,880
about sanjoy I had a um an office mate a

1265
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,440
Brazilian uh he spoke uh Portuguese with

1266
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:21,440
me I spoke Brazilian with him at least

1267
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:23,719
by the time he finished so J paer paer

1268
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,480
kept talking about this guy this new

1269
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:28,480
faculty member that came and was giving

1270
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,840
these courses on

1271
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:33,239
optimization now optimization today is

1272
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:38,199
our bread and butter okay but this is

1273
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:44,280
the early' 70s and Sunjoy somehow

1274
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:48,360
brought to uh m a course that you can

1275
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:52,239
see his foresight that became really the

1276
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:55,159
tools of um bread and butter that we use

1277
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:57,080
today but this is back back then and uh

1278
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:58,120
of course convex optimization and all

1279
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,120
such

1280
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,120
things

1281
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:10,040
so this kind of illustrate s joy as a

1282
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:13,440
professor to me and at the time so after

1283
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:16,440
I completed my thesis in 1975 I became a

1284
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:19,239
professor at the University in Portugal

1285
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:23,320
and experiencing exciting times because

1286
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:28,639
the dictatorship of 48 dictatorship had

1287
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:30,639
fallen in 197 24 in December 1980 at the

1288
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:34,679
systems analysis and optimization

1289
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:40,320
conference at inria in Ro and C France

1290
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:44,480
so inria was Ira I Chang the name by Lou

1291
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:48,840
Leon that uh Ellen mentioned so I met s

1292
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:50,719
Joy again so this is 1980 We Set Side by

1293
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,760
Side during a sightseeing tour from

1294
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:56,360
Versa to parie and my life was about to

1295
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,920
change we were were both interested in

1296
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:01,360
nonlinear filtering sojoy from a

1297
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,320
continuous time fundamental perspective

1298
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,080
and I from a discrete time design

1299
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:08,440
problem solving

1300
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:11,199
angle during that bus ride sanj invited

1301
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:14,679
me to a meeting on nonlinear filtering

1302
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:18,360
in tulus this is now March

1303
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:22,360
1981 I actually know the dates 12 and 13

1304
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:26,000
March 19 81 he was organizing this

1305
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:30,199
conference at the laborat

1306
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,199
the system called L and that last s Joy

1307
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,040
asked me to give a talk at leads which I

1308
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:35,800
did in

1309
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:39,400
1983 but when I wrote this I forgot but

1310
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:42,760
now I remember that in between um I

1311
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:45,159
organized the meeting um um one of those

1312
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:48,239
NATO Advanced study institutes that

1313
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:51,920
there were at the time two we meeting in

1314
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:54,840
algarin Portugal with dick buy sanjy was

1315
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:57,000
a a speaker there and of course s joy

1316
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:00,800
and Adriana showed up and they showed up

1317
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:03,239
with a Cy of Italian friends and those

1318
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:06,320
Italian friends in those two weeks we

1319
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:08,440
all became friends for life although we

1320
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,760
never met again but it was very

1321
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:14,159
intensive very uh Sunjoy like at at the

1322
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,360
end of the day we all would go to the

1323
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:20,360
beach and S Joy would entertain with

1324
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:23,320
lots of stories andriana and

1325
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,400
Italians and by talking about Italians

1326
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,880
Bruno is here and so he must know what

1327
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:31,639
I'm talking

1328
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,880
about okay so I did give that talk in

1329
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:36,679
leads in

1330
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:40,080
1983 and then sjy invited me to come on

1331
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:43,280
sabatico um which we did Manuel and I

1332
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:47,199
came and this is 1984 to

1333
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:49,480
1986 and during those two years we had

1334
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:51,440
countless discussions on the theoretical

1335
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:54,120
underpinnings of nonlinear stochastic

1336
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,639
filtering System Theory identification

1337
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:58,480
inference and learning and the way it

1338
01:15:56,639 --> 01:16:01,040
was was like this I would spend the

1339
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,960
whole day immersed on two or three books

1340
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,480
highly theoretical books that I was

1341
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:09,280
trying to study okay and then sjy would

1342
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:11,480
come early in the morning and then would

1343
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,920
come at the end of the day and during

1344
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:16,560
lunch and during lunch we would always

1345
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,679
grab a sandwich and if Peter was around

1346
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:23,239
we would go with Peter to some joint

1347
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:27,000
nearby Building 35 on MF there were few

1348
01:16:23,239 --> 01:16:29,159
there and would bring and it it there

1349
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,080
and of course I spent the whole day

1350
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:32,880
trying to do the proofs and trying to

1351
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,239
understand and so forth and that the end

1352
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,120
s Joy would come and put everything back

1353
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:40,000
in place and I would understand what I

1354
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:44,320
spent eight hours trying to understand

1355
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
after my sabatical I joined CMU in

1356
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,800
1986 but now things change completely

1357
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,199
because our relation with sjy now uh

1358
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,280
enlarged to

1359
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:58,239
Manuel and um and Manuela was of course

1360
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:01,880
doing her PhD and finished and became a

1361
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:04,920
professor in Ai and Robotics and S Joy

1362
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:08,520
had this fascination with AI okay and I

1363
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:13,600
think that in over

1364
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:16,960
those H 30 or 40 years that followed we

1365
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:20,560
uh we kept coming to Cambridge just to

1366
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,719
to be with sanjo and Adriana and Adrian

1367
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,960
and I would sit back because Manuel and

1368
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:28,280
sanjy would spend the evening or the

1369
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:32,000
dinner or the lunch just talking about a

1370
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:33,960
and Adrian and I would try to

1371
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,960
participate a little bit here and there

1372
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:41,920
but of course it was not for

1373
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:46,159
us I even um one story uh I suggested

1374
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:49,239
once uh uh to my department or college

1375
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:51,320
that they invite s sjy to be part of a

1376
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:55,080
visiting Committee of the department so

1377
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:57,920
sjy came and uh of course uh he had the

1378
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:00,320
big ideas about education and all that

1379
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,440
and uh and then at the end they reported

1380
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:05,840
to the president Cherry Cohen who

1381
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:09,320
unfortunately passed away sadly very

1382
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:12,040
recently so Jerry Jerry Cohen the

1383
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:14,560
president and S Joy immediately

1384
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:17,280
connected because the moment Jerry saw

1385
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,960
sjy coming in he recognized his

1386
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:23,520
Professor from optimization when Jerry

1387
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:27,280
was a student here at at MIT so he was

1388
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:29,520
he kept telling me over and over oh it

1389
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,760
was so great meeting the professor and

1390
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:35,520
the optimization that made my life and

1391
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:38,760
so forth in my numerous

1392
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,679
interactions um I think I referred to

1393
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,120
this

1394
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:45,040
already but but by then as I mentioned

1395
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:49,080
uh the group had enlarged so Adriana

1396
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:52,000
manueles and joy myself we became from

1397
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,960
Professor and Mentor we became family

1398
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,600
friends and uh we kept coming as I

1399
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:02,159
mentioned uh to um to to Cambridge just

1400
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:05,400
to be with sjy so in preparing for this

1401
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,679
event um when sanjy passed away I spent

1402
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:10,480
a couple of days just going on the web

1403
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:13,920
and looking at the YouTube videos of of

1404
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:17,800
sanjy um but uh I did the same again

1405
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:21,639
this time and um I looked at a lecture

1406
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:24,280
two 20124 lecture at the Tata Institute

1407
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:28,120
and that's an a quintessential s joy and

1408
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:31,480
this is goes along what Alan uh said but

1409
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:34,080
with a few twists in just 50 minutes

1410
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:36,679
with 10 minutes to spare so it's 60 but

1411
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:39,360
he only covered 50 minutes he

1412
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:42,800
masterfully presented his variational

1413
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:45,080
approach to filtering on a green wall

1414
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:48,239
to--all chalkboard so you have to see

1415
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:52,840
the the this this lecture so it's a a

1416
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:57,600
huge green CH green board and he picks

1417
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:59,960
up the chalk piece walks to and and he's

1418
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,560
going to give a lecture about this

1419
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:05,000
variational approach to filtering okay

1420
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,880
which combines stochastic process

1421
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,880
nonlinear Fields random Fields uh

1422
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,320
quantum physics mechanic quantum

1423
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:16,440
mechanics thetis all these topics to

1424
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:20,040
this 20 or 30 students sitting in front

1425
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:23,400
of him okay and

1426
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:26,239
uh any one of us trying to do that would

1427
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:29,040
feel am going to be able to do this it's

1428
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:30,679
going to be a fiasco because no student

1429
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,040
will understand anything of what I'm

1430
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:38,080
going to say he walks into the the board

1431
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:41,679
and as as Ellen says oh divides the

1432
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:46,440
board into with vertical lines into

1433
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:48,760
pieces okay and uh I don't know I

1434
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:51,159
sometimes I try to do that and I can't

1435
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:53,320
constrain myself between those vertical

1436
01:20:51,159 --> 01:20:54,920
I start going to the next one so I erase

1437
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,280
the line and then I go to the next next

1438
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:59,920
one but he

1439
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,960
did kept it and then he start writing

1440
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,199
with a

1441
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:07,880
beautiful meticulous and beautiful

1442
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:11,400
calligraphy he fills the board not too

1443
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:14,199
densely with a comprehensive Panorama of

1444
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,600
filtering starting with Bas law and the

1445
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:18,639
search for the conditional distribution

1446
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,960
he then transitioned to Gibbs

1447
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:23,760
distributions the harmlessly Clifford

1448
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:27,080
theorum and connected this Con Concepts

1449
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,159
to Marco renom Fields sjy reformulated

1450
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:31,320
Gibbs with the hamiltonian introduced

1451
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:34,400
free energy and L linked it to

1452
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:36,239
differential entropy in a magical moment

1453
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,920
he reveals that the conditional

1454
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:40,120
distribution which is the solution to

1455
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,320
the nonl to the nonlinear filtering

1456
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:45,440
problem is the minimizer of the free

1457
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:48,000
energy so I gave you these words and I'm

1458
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:50,639
sure that not everybody followed them

1459
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:55,120
but this is what he did to these 20 or

1460
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:58,639
30 students at the Tata Institute

1461
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:01,760
and throughout he never hearded welcomed

1462
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:04,560
interruptions and encouraged student

1463
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,159
engagement with time to spare he

1464
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,679
provided a broad view of the significant

1465
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:13,679
questions worth pursuing even suggesting

1466
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:16,880
in the middle of his talk suggests oh

1467
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:19,760
and by the way you should revisit the

1468
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,440
book Gibbs measure and face transitions

1469
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:25,000
by some author some distinguished author

1470
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:27,760
and you should reformulate the book in

1471
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,960
terms of conditional probabilities okay

1472
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,159
this is a program he proposed to these

1473
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,800
20

1474
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:37,360
students and it's a very deep very deep

1475
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,840
actually I also revisit his brief

1476
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:43,639
comments at leads at

1477
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,560
80 and uh many of you I'm sure were

1478
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:49,159
there I unfortunately I couldn't be

1479
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:51,639
there he masterfully reminded us of what

1480
01:22:49,159 --> 01:22:54,639
he called The System Theory revolution

1481
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:56,639
of the 50s and 60s

1482
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:59,560
that he attributes to several people

1483
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:02,120
including Colman of course who brought

1484
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,760
the new language of algebra differential

1485
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:06,120
equations and stochastic process to

1486
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:10,239
engineering problems so he point his

1487
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:11,400
point was okay there was a revolution

1488
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,639
but the

1489
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,280
revolution scientific revolution in the

1490
01:23:13,639 --> 01:23:18,480
50s and 60s but the revolution had to do

1491
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:21,239
also with the language the new tools

1492
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:24,560
that you brought and he then challenges

1493
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:28,360
the audience and the leads people there

1494
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:32,120
and uh all of us to look at

1495
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:34,760
problems in a fundamental way to develop

1496
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:37,400
a revolutionary new paradigm with an

1497
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:39,639
appropriate language so he says we are

1498
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,000
missing the language of the next

1499
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:45,480
Revolution sanjy couldn't resist

1500
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,199
challenging us to think big and think

1501
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:50,080
fundamentally we visited sjy and Adrian

1502
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:52,679
in cambrid several times a year and

1503
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,800
returned for another sabatical in 2006

1504
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:56,960
our tradition of having dinner on the

1505
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,639
Friday after Thanksgiving because you

1506
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:02,880
heard that Thanksgiving he was taken by

1507
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:06,719
Peter so we were left with the day after

1508
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:09,080
okay we were and uh that lasted for

1509
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,199
several years we frequently continue

1510
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:15,280
through the years to meet now often with

1511
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:17,760
Rea at the alers cafe for a burger or at

1512
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:20,120
legal seafood at the Charles hotel and

1513
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,760
after they both Clos to have lunch at

1514
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,719
the Harvest also in Harvard Square

1515
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:27,159
continuing our conversations until

1516
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:30,239
almost the very end in June

1517
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:35,000
2023 our last visit with s Joy was on

1518
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:38,440
March 2023 Manuel had do some work in in

1519
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,360
London and uh I accompanied so that we

1520
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:44,960
could go and visit S

1521
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:48,520
Joy the record in

1522
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:51,480
London so we all deeply miss uh the many

1523
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:55,000
conversations with enjoy that profoundly

1524
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:57,520
uh shaped our thinking I cherish how he

1525
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,320
always pushed me in particular to ask

1526
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,920
the fundamental questions to view

1527
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:04,119
problems view problems from an abstract

1528
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,199
Global Perspective and to use the most

1529
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:09,199
appropriate mathematics and insights to

1530
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:12,840
find the simplest yet most profound and

1531
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:18,880
comprehensive Solutions s Joy was uh of

1532
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:22,840
course a professor was uh a a mentor was

1533
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:24,600
a league was a friend was a thinker was

1534
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,679
a gentleman

1535
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:30,800
and that's uh how I uh I choose to

1536
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,800
remember him thank

1537
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,719
you I think we're cutting well into

1538
01:25:35,639 --> 01:25:40,400
other people's time but we'll we'll

1539
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:42,320
continue and we'll make it uh shorter uh

1540
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:46,080
these memories are too precious to cut

1541
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,080
off or cut short so

1542
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,880
Maxim I'll get

1543
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:56,239
you you have that

1544
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:08,520
right okay so um right I think the first

1545
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:11,040
paper uh by

1546
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:13,440
sanjoy um that I that really profoundly

1547
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,639
affected profoundly affected me before I

1548
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,199
I I got to meet sanjoy was uh the paper

1549
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:19,360
his brother mentioned on variational

1550
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:21,560
approach to nonlinear estimation I think

1551
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,560
that was about 2008 that's when I was

1552
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,639
kind of you know soul searching I uh did

1553
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,639
my PhD in mathematical physics and I was

1554
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:28,880
switching to uh information Theory

1555
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:31,320
control and machine learning and this

1556
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,320
was a paper that really kind of put a

1557
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,560
few things uh together for me and my

1558
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:38,560
Fred Todd Coleman um who was at

1559
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:40,199
University of Illinois I I was a post do

1560
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,000
at the time he was faculty he said oh

1561
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:45,400
yeah you know I took courses with sanjoy

1562
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,880
mitter he's an amazing scholar and the

1563
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,440
uh overall aidite and just just really

1564
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:52,400
knowledgeable about everything and my

1565
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,560
adviser Horus Yuan who did his PhD uh at

1566
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,159
MIT with Bob Kennedy said he had

1567
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,679
countless conversations with sanjoy

1568
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:02,960
during his days um so that that paper

1569
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:06,520
really uh kind of said the standard for

1570
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:08,560
me intellectually and uh and even

1571
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:13,000
philosophically and it turned out that

1572
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:15,159
um after I uh first met sany in 2013 I

1573
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,880
think when I came to give a talk at Lids

1574
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:20,000
on some work I had done at the

1575
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,719
intersection of uh ideas in economics

1576
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,560
and rate Distortion Theory and then we

1577
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:25,239
had a conversation with San joy and it

1578
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:28,159
turned out that our common interest

1579
01:27:25,239 --> 01:27:30,880
really really was philosophy and uh so

1580
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:32,600
so this uh this is just a few samples of

1581
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,239
I think the kind of deep philosophical

1582
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,280
ideas sanoy put together uh he

1583
01:27:35,239 --> 01:27:39,719
articulated what it means to be an

1584
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:42,360
engineer that it's not uh just a

1585
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:44,000
utilitarian you know always thinking in

1586
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:49,040
terms of costs and benefits it's it's a

1587
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:51,760
world viiew that uh is really aimed at

1588
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:54,840
creating and maintaining systems that

1589
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:58,520
that serve uh that serve purposes for uh

1590
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:00,000
for improvement of of lives and uh uh

1591
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:02,360
infrastructure systems that that's

1592
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,400
surround us so I'm I'm just going to

1593
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:07,600
give you a few examples so this is

1594
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,679
1979 um he had this paper called the the

1595
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,679
analogies uh between certain models and

1596
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:13,119
quantum mechanics nonlinear filtering

1597
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,360
and so I you know I I kind of chose a

1598
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:18,000
few quotes from pH philosophy of science

1599
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,280
here's a a book by uh Mary Hessa who was

1600
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,040
a philosopher of Science in the UK in

1601
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:26,320
1966 on the role of analogy in metaphor

1602
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,199
and science the idea is that not science

1603
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:30,400
does not just proceed deductively there

1604
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:32,520
there's a role for for metaphors that

1605
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,199
help you link one thing to another and

1606
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,400
and thus lead to better explanations and

1607
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:39,639
and result in growth of ideas and that's

1608
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:42,280
exactly what you see in the opening

1609
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:43,920
paragraphs of of of sanj's paper on on

1610
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:47,760
quantum mechanics nonlinear

1611
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:51,239
filtering and by the way this paper also

1612
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,400
has a um precursor to some ideas that

1613
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:55,159
are now becoming fashionable have become

1614
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,199
fashionable and context of probabilistic

1615
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:58,520
generative models based on diffusions a

1616
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:01,119
lot of the roots of this are really in

1617
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:04,280
sano's work and here he also makes a

1618
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:07,000
distinction between uh problems in

1619
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:09,159
physics where there's a language that

1620
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,360
that's uh uh important in physics but

1621
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:13,239
but also problems in engineering where

1622
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,840
one distinguishing factor is this idea

1623
01:29:13,239 --> 01:29:17,080
that you you're trying to make

1624
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:19,880
inferences based on noisy observations

1625
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,760
which he correctly says is absent in

1626
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:24,880
physics and the reason why that's absent

1627
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:28,080
in physics is that physics

1628
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:30,520
is concerned with discovery of laws that

1629
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:33,480
are stable and will continue to be

1630
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:35,320
stable um throughout time whereas

1631
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,760
engineering is really about synthesis of

1632
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:41,119
new systems and this is uh this is a

1633
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,800
memo he wrote 1985 uh some thoughts on

1634
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:44,560
engineering education that really puts

1635
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:48,080
this puts this forward very very

1636
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:51,639
forcefully and the idea is that um

1637
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:56,440
Engineers should embrace the role of

1638
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:59,320
creators of of new AR facts new laws

1639
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:01,719
that are based on interaction between

1640
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:04,920
systems in their environments and that

1641
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:08,239
would include not only devices but also

1642
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,440
uh the human element and he reiterated

1643
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:12,080
this uh so these you know these are all

1644
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:14,600
just just the kind of things that Sano

1645
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:17,159
would and I would discuss over email um

1646
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:18,600
and in fact just I think just a few

1647
01:30:17,159 --> 01:30:20,600
weeks before he passed away we're

1648
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:23,520
exchanging some emails about uh

1649
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:26,520
philosophy of biology that was kind of

1650
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,719
uh an interesting U thing as well you

1651
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,960
know because that's also connected to AI

1652
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,440
so here are some ideas on conceptual

1653
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,119
foundations of computer and system

1654
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:39,199
Sciences again really emphasizing the

1655
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:41,080
fact that um creation of new systems

1656
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:44,880
understanding of of the role of function

1657
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:50,840
and purpose which sort of was was was

1658
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:54,600
gone from uh 18th century um Newtonian

1659
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:57,080
physics uh is really it really

1660
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,560
profoundly present in in the context of

1661
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:01,280
Engineering Systems and sanjoy really

1662
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:04,360
took the time

1663
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,480
to uh provide expository notes about

1664
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:10,719
this that that I think deserves further

1665
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:12,760
um further study and reflection uh and

1666
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:17,199
going through the years this is

1667
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:19,600
1994 this is an amazing monograph 150

1668
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:21,760
pages that he co-wrote with Bernard Gau

1669
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:25,280
and Charles Rockland that really

1670
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,280
outlines more or less uh the way that we

1671
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:30,320
think

1672
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:33,320
about large scale neural networks but

1673
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:36,080
viewed from the point of

1674
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:38,639
um seeing seeing where the limitations

1675
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,159
of limitations of formal modeling come

1676
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:42,480
up against the complexity of these

1677
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:45,000
systems so I really Rec I I recommend

1678
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,639
this to anyone um who will listen

1679
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,119
because because it was really extremely

1680
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:51,000
forward-looking

1681
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:54,239
um document so the main thing that

1682
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,800
really really struck me here is that uh

1683
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:57,600
the you know this humility in the role

1684
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,520
of mathematics that we think that

1685
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:04,239
mathematizing the world is the way to is

1686
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:06,880
the way to uh uh to understand it but

1687
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:09,560
here sanjo and his co-authors are really

1688
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,280
really emphasizing the point that uh

1689
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,800
certain systems for example those that

1690
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:15,639
have Arisen through biological evolution

1691
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,600
not necessar are not necessarily

1692
01:32:15,639 --> 01:32:20,760
formalizable mathematically and the role

1693
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:23,440
of the role of Engineers is not to write

1694
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:26,639
down more equations it is to suggest

1695
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:28,440
principes Les uh that underly certain

1696
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,320
complex architectures and see how these

1697
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:34,360
principles are common in a variety of

1698
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:37,199
settings again this if if if uh uh I

1699
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:39,080
hope that this uh I'm pretty sure that

1700
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:42,679
at this point in Google Scholar this

1701
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,679
paper has one citation it's by

1702
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:57,239
me would always email this oh nice

1703
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,960
um this is 1997 I think this is the talk

1704
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:02,080
he gave at the Norbert weiner Symposium

1705
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:05,400
here he you know really uh has a unique

1706
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,800
take on the problems of uh learning uh

1707
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:10,199
that I think he was becoming interested

1708
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:13,119
in this in the context of U Ai and in

1709
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:14,800
multi-layered complex architectures and

1710
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:17,440
when he says that he wants to take an

1711
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,719
internalist perspective where various

1712
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,760
internal templates that that that kind

1713
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:23,600
of characterize different different

1714
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,600
invariants and different features in the

1715
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:30,520
system system uh are the main ingredient

1716
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,800
and and data are just used as uh as the

1717
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,080
link to the empirical reality I I I

1718
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,600
think that he actually borrowed this

1719
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,440
idea from no chsky who had this

1720
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,080
internalist perspective on language what

1721
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:42,960
what is inside speakers heads their

1722
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:45,679
internal States um and then this is the

1723
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:48,520
last uh document that that I'll mention

1724
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:51,639
this is a this is a um a paper he

1725
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,280
presented on a at a symposium on on uh

1726
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:55,159
economics and and social systems on

1727
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,920
system Effectiveness and this one is

1728
01:33:55,159 --> 01:33:58,840
remarkable because after the paper

1729
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:00,760
itself there's a transcript of a

1730
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,679
discussion San Joy had with economists

1731
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,440
and sociologists where you know he

1732
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:06,280
really held his own he he knew his

1733
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:09,360
literature you know where else could you

1734
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:12,239
see references to Yan williams'

1735
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:16,760
behavioral approach to control uh but

1736
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:18,560
also uh um books by um shenberg on you

1737
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,760
know composition in in in modernist

1738
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:23,080
music and Alfred North Whitehead who was

1739
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:26,159
you know co-author with Russell of pipan

1740
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:29,040
Mathematica but whad actually had uh his

1741
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:30,960
own philosophy which was in many in many

1742
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:33,520
ways kind of connected to Buddhism it's

1743
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,719
to see the world as a network of

1744
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,880
interlocking processes as opposed to as

1745
01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:39,880
opposed to as opposed to things and this

1746
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,480
is the way of thinking about complex

1747
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:44,280
systems that Sanu really brought to the

1748
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:46,760
four so here the idea is that we build

1749
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:49,560
all these systems such as the internet

1750
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:52,600
that are so complex that we will never

1751
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,280
be able to really make uh detailed

1752
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,880
statements about what each packet and

1753
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,159
the internet is doing what each link is

1754
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:00,760
doing and yet as a whole this system is

1755
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:02,440
called coherent and effective and the

1756
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,800
reason why that happens is because it's

1757
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,679
connected to an environment that

1758
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,840
includes users includes the you know

1759
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,920
shifting shifting demands shifting

1760
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,840
realities and these systems we as

1761
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:15,719
Engineers are responsible for

1762
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:17,840
maintaining designing and and really uh

1763
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:20,000
exercising responsibility as not just

1764
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,440
Engineers but also as humanists and this

1765
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,199
like I said this this is this is the

1766
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,280
part of Sanu that I'll I'll miss the

1767
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:26,520
most is

1768
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:28,840
conversations that go beyond just just

1769
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:31,960
technical papers so thank you sanjoy

1770
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,960
very much for for the

1771
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,800
inspiration we've gone well over the

1772
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:42,159
time we had in the program I'm just

1773
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:46,080
going to wrap up if you could put uh

1774
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:47,920
George's slides back up um with a few

1775
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,920
pictures and I'll go through them

1776
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,920
quickly

1777
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,119
okay so I'm just picking up where I left

1778
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,080
off but there's a big gap because I

1779
01:36:02,119 --> 01:36:06,639
really started to interact with sanjoy

1780
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:09,600
more closely in his later years this is

1781
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:13,000
a a picture with Tom kyot this is from

1782
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:16,239
some time ago uh it's a picture I'm very

1783
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,639
fond of uh and Tom Kyo actually sent in

1784
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:20,159
a message for this conference but I'm

1785
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,679
not going to read it now although I have

1786
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:24,960
it all here we'll have it read at the

1787
01:36:22,679 --> 01:36:27,960
afternoon session he does point to the

1788
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:31,280
same paper on testing the manifold

1789
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:35,360
hypothesis um that was mentioned by

1790
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:37,880
pronob San joo's rather um I I

1791
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,239
highlighted uh the something that has

1792
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:41,440
come through in everything people have

1793
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:44,600
said that he never seemed to be in a

1794
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:46,800
hurry about anything and um that's

1795
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,760
really the the picture we have okay

1796
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,520
we'll we'll get through this uh later

1797
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,280
but I I wanted to show you some pictures

1798
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:57,040
this is uh in London you see Tom kyot

1799
01:36:54,280 --> 01:37:01,320
there you also see Martin Clark uh

1800
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:04,639
sanjoy you see um David Maine and some

1801
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:07,880
of you may know um ARA M as well who I

1802
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:11,480
think was is related to sanjoy and then

1803
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:14,520
Reika his wife uh who's based in London

1804
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:16,360
and so they had to have this back and

1805
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:18,719
forth visiting each other either in

1806
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:21,280
London or Cambridge over the

1807
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:24,480
years

1808
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:26,400
um this is a picture this may be from

1809
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,480
wedding of the FES perhaps because I've

1810
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:32,400
never seen sanjo in a tux till I saw the

1811
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,360
picture that um Peter put up but anyway

1812
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,560
I wish it was in sharper Focus but I

1813
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:38,840
thought he looked very elegant and I

1814
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:42,400
pulled that out this is sanjoy

1815
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:44,320
expounding at a dinner in his room uh

1816
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,199
that hand gesture is something that was

1817
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,080
kind of unique to sanjoy I haven't seen

1818
01:37:46,199 --> 01:37:51,040
anyone else hold his hand quite like

1819
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:54,119
that uh and he's talking about something

1820
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:56,840
always the glass of wine nearby

1821
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:59,960
um this is sanjo with raika on one of

1822
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:02,159
her um visits extended visits to um

1823
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,360
Cambridge this is an dear friend Tuli

1824
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:08,119
Banner's

1825
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:10,760
home um and uh this is on one of PR's

1826
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:12,719
visits he pronob talked about uh the

1827
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,800
coffee table with all the books and it

1828
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,320
was it's fascinating if you zo zoom in

1829
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:19,400
there to see all the different titles

1830
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,520
and indeed it's the bhat Gita but

1831
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:24,040
there's poetry there's Dylan

1832
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,080
Thomas uh and uh

1833
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:28,280
a whole range of things and of course

1834
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:33,320
pouring wine to

1835
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:36,639
entertain August 2022 and then in h

1836
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:39,199
September I had the uh pleasure of a a

1837
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:42,280
lunch at tuscanos in Harvard Square One

of sanj's favorite restaurants uh with

1839
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:47,080
pronob and then this is the two elegant

1840
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:49,960
gentlemen walking we walked all the way

1841
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:51,840
back to uh his apartment so you can see

1842
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,800
where the prince of Florence uh

1843
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:58,840
description comes from very elegant

1844
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:01,920
there this is sanjo back in uh England

1845
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:03,239
um I think before his last trip uh out

1846
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,560
to

1847
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:08,719
Cambridge uh this is him enjoying a

1848
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:12,560
drink uh in his garden just a couple of

1849
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:15,199
weeks uh before his passing and um you

1850
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:17,480
know right to the end uh enjoying the

1851
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:20,040
conversation enjoying being

1852
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:21,840
outside and couple of weeks later he

1853
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,520
passed away I think apart from his

1854
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,840
caregivers

1855
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,599
I may have been the last one to see him

1856
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:31,040
of of this crowd he had a big support

1857
01:39:28,599 --> 01:39:35,599
system here in Cambridge that included

1858
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:38,560
his dear nie aneli duva mitter uh friend

1859
01:39:35,599 --> 01:39:42,679
Tuli banagi whom I mentioned uh there

1860
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:48,480
were folks from MIT menen and snow and

1861
01:39:42,679 --> 01:39:51,679
uh Rachel and um uh the fs and I'm sure

1862
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:53,840

the morning so we're going to continue

1935
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:53,679
uh with our next panel uh uh about sanjo

1936
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:56,679
as a gentleman and lifelong scholar

1937
02:00:53,679 --> 02:01:01,320
we're going to hear testimonials from uh

1938
02:00:56,679 --> 02:01:04,320
colleagues um and I'm going to get uh uh

1939
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:06,639
moner to have us uh start the session

1940
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:10,000
hopefully monzer can also moderate

1941
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:10,000
session as well thank you so

1942
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:16,199
much thank you ali uh good morning

1943
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:19,599
everyone um I had my day in court

1944
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:21,119
yesterday and I gave you my uh my briefs

1945
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:23,119
about sanjoy so I'm not going to bore

1946
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:25,960
you today in fact I'm to try to make up

1947
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:27,760
some of the time because of that uh um

1948
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:29,480
so I think it's recorded so you can you

1949
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,599
can hear it there's one thing that I

1950
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:33,239
wanted to mention that I didn't talk a

1951
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,599
lot you know quite a bit about it

1952
02:01:33,239 --> 02:01:38,599
yesterday in the banquet and that is

1953
02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:41,480
sort of the the vision that sanjoy had

1954
02:01:38,599 --> 02:01:43,520
and how he helped in realizing and

1955
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:45,440
building institutions at MIT I do want

1956
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:47,800
to just say a few words about sort of

1957
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:51,320
the creation of idss and the role that

1958
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:54,320
sanjo played in that um you know so in

1959
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:58,239
2013 when we started deliberating around

1960
02:01:54,320 --> 02:02:00,920
the idea of how do we uh be prepared to

1961
02:01:58,239 --> 02:02:02,840
address the the the growing world of

1962
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:06,119
artificial intelligence data science and

1963
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:09,119
so forth sanjo sort of brought in the

1964
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:12,040
his perspective about how you know the

1965
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:14,800
system Theory thinking and statistical

1966
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:17,480
thinking can actually help in the in the

1967
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:19,840
growing sort of data that is coming

1968
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:21,960
essentially from people coming from not

1969
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:24,400
just from machine not things that we

1970
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:27,440
know the physics of or the biology and

1971
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:29,880
the fact um statistics has actually gone

1972
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:31,639
uh through a a revolution you know in

1973
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:34,000
terms of high dimensional statistics and

1974
02:02:31,639 --> 02:02:36,560
thinking about networks and interactions

1975
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,599
and so forth that in fact that has to be

1976
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:42,360
at the core of what we're doing if we

1977
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:45,920
are going to bring solutions to societal

1978
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:49,199
challenges so the first piece and is

1979
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:51,639
that whatever idss did it had to bring

1980
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:53,840
statistics right at the core of what

1981
02:02:51,639 --> 02:02:56,199
what it's doing and bring a a sort of a

1982
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,400
home for statistics at MIT and for those

1983
02:02:56,199 --> 02:03:00,040
of you who didn't know you know MIT has

1984
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:02,760
attempted to build a department of

1985
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:05,320
statistics for almost 50 years before

1986
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:07,320
that and has never happened and so San

1987
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:09,679
Joo was actually adant about the fact

1988
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:11,560
that in fact this is the opportunity to

1989
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:13,560
build something doesn't have to be a

1990
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:16,239
department but a place to convene and

1991
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:18,280
think about statistics the second piece

1992
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:20,800
as we started thinking about sort of

1993
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,280
societal challenges the big problems and

1994
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,560
we sort of

1995
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:26,199
um you know arrived and I'll tell you

1996
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,800
you know not in the same sequence of

1997
02:03:26,199 --> 02:03:30,040
things but we arrived to this idea that

1998
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:33,840
I often call the triangle sort of the

1999
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:36,119
the the a triangle that guided the idss

2000
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,800
and that is every almost every societal

2001
02:03:36,119 --> 02:03:40,119
problem you can think of it as the

2002
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:42,159
interaction of three important

2003
02:03:40,119 --> 02:03:45,960
components uh the

2004
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:48,440
physical um aspect of a system the

2005
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:50,440
social interaction with that particular

2006
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:52,320
system and then the institutional part

2007
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:54,400
that regulate that that particular

2008
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:58,320
interaction almost every complex problem

2009
02:03:54,400 --> 02:04:01,159
has those components and data is often

2010
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:02,760
available about all of these components

2011
02:04:01,159 --> 02:04:04,960
but the data that is available at these

2012
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:07,040
components isn't always sort of

2013
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:09,159
connected and timestamped it's very

2014
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,920
different from each other and so forth

2015
02:04:09,159 --> 02:04:13,119
so the vision that always Sano has

2016
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:15,440
talked about is that you don't just slap

2017
02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:18,000
these things together and think that you

2018
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,119
have a model to solve a problem you have

2019
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,280
to think about abstraction and sanjo

2020
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:24,599
used the word abstraction very often

2021
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:26,639
you know you take this complex

2022
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:29,040
description and you abstract or you

2023
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:31,599
distill from it a piece a problem that

2024
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:33,679
you are able to to tackle that you can

2025
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:35,960
solve the formulation of the problem

2026
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:37,760
matters and then the data can help you

2027
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,480
sort of address and solve these problems

2028
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:42,159
I would say that you know I talked

2029
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:45,000
yesterday about sort of the kind of the

2030
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:47,320
impact that sanj talked about human

2031
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,320
interaction and human connections and

2032
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:51,840
having the right people in place but

2033
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:53,760
also the importance of the topics and

2034
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:55,480
the Notions of abstractions were also a

2035
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:57,719
big piece of the advice that he

2036
02:04:55,480 --> 02:05:00,199
continuously gave in the in the creation

2037
02:04:57,719 --> 02:05:02,199
of idss so I'm not going to bore you

2038
02:05:00,199 --> 02:05:05,840
anymore I want to say and I want to give

2039
02:05:02,199 --> 02:05:07,320
the the floor to our panel we have and I

2040
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:09,599
don't know the order I think we have

2041
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:13,599
John CIS who is on Zoom that's going to

2042
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:16,280
appear shortly um we have V borar uh

2043
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:21,079
John Baris Maria illich and U mimo

2044
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:23,639
Francis so uh I don't know the order um

2045
02:05:21,079 --> 02:05:23,639
is John coming

2046
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,840
next okay they just fixed it okay so

2047
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:43,719
John you're

2048
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:47,599
on all right well I'm really sorry that

2049
02:05:43,719 --> 02:05:49,320
I was not able to attend in person I had

2050
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:51,239
planned a long time ago to be in a

2051
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:54,199
different continent but I definitely

2052
02:05:51,239 --> 02:05:56,320
wanted to take the opportunity to share

2053
02:05:54,199 --> 02:05:59,360
Impressions and feelings about sanjoy he

2054
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:01,559
was a truly remarkable person a dear

2055
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:05,040
Mentor colleague and

2056
02:06:01,559 --> 02:06:07,520
friend so I first met San Joy when I was

2057
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:10,639
beginning as a graduate student in LS

2058
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:13,840
that was in the early 80s so around that

2059
02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:16,320
time sanjoy was very interested in

2060
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:19,960
nonlinear filtering I guess that stayed

2061
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:23,000
for a long time and he had written uh

2062
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:26,119
just a little before and import paper on

2063
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:28,880
the famous Innovations conjecture and so

2064
02:06:26,119 --> 02:06:31,719
I remember our first real scientific

2065
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:34,880
interaction we were both taking a flight

2066
02:06:31,719 --> 02:06:36,920
to a CDC across the country we were on

2067
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:40,280
the same flight so while we were

2068
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:43,119
boarding sanjoy goes oh by the way there

2069
02:06:40,280 --> 02:06:45,599
is this open problem in nonlinear

2070
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:48,320
filtering okay so I was hoping that I

2071
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:51,679
would be sleeping on the flight but San

2072
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:53,840
Joy had this great way of nudging you

2073
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:56,639
and pointing to something interesting

2074
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:59,320
and to get you thinking so actually I

2075
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:01,920
was not a student of sanjoy he was not

2076
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:04,920
even in my thesis committee I didn't

2077
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:07,840
work with him in my student or Junior

2078
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:10,840
years I did not attend any of his

2079
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:13,239
classes so we at those Early times we

2080
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:16,840
didn't have any formal

2081
02:07:13,239 --> 02:07:18,400
intersection however he was everywhere

2082
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:20,159
his presence

2083
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:23,280
was

2084
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:26,159
ubiquitous so he was a constant presence

2085
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:28,679
in my life somehow despite the fact that

2086
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:30,960
we didn't have the formal interactions

2087
02:07:28,679 --> 02:07:33,679
that's because he was passionate about

2088
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:37,119
all kinds of intellectual matters a

2089
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:38,800
source of inspiration all the time he

2090
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:41,360
had a very distinct and unique

2091
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:43,520
intellectual style he would always try

2092
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:45,920
to make connections between viewpoints

2093
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:50,199
and Fields people have already commented

2094
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:52,480
that but uh his favorite was clearly to

2095
02:07:50,199 --> 02:07:55,159
make links between mathematical physics

2096
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:58,480
and control theory uh so I think that

2097
02:07:55,159 --> 02:08:00,880
was a recurring recurring theme and so

2098
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:03,119
he would nudge people to look at those

2099
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:04,520
connections and look for deep and

2100
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:06,760
fundamental

2101
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:09,119
connections uh even if he wouldn't get

2102
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:12,079
into the technicalities himself he had

2103
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:15,520
this vision of research programs that

2104
02:08:12,079 --> 02:08:19,159
people uh should follow and how to look

2105
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:21,960
into the deep aspects and the essence

2106
02:08:19,159 --> 02:08:25,159
and also as an informal advice

2107
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:27,000
he was most famous for whenever you

2108
02:08:25,159 --> 02:08:30,520
would talk to him about something he

2109
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:34,760
would dig out from his folders some

2110
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:37,960
obscure paper that could actually be

2111
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:40,880
relevant but which no one might have

2112
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:43,559
seen and all that so you would always go

2113
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:47,159
okay do you know about this paper and

2114
02:08:43,559 --> 02:08:49,280
find some photocopy some her deep in his

2115
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:51,760
folders okay but the interaction with

2116
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:54,679
sanjoy was not just in the direction

2117
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:58,440
from Professor to the students in the

2118
02:08:54,679 --> 02:09:02,760
disciples it was not one way he was at

2119
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:05,719
the same time getting input or feedback

2120
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:07,920
he was a very keen Observer of

2121
02:09:05,719 --> 02:09:11,199
everything that would be going on so let

2122
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:15,000
me share this picture of

2123
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:18,239
his uh so you can see San Joy here he's

2124
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,880
observing he thinking there's a glimpse

2125
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:23,360
of a friendly smile but also a sense

2126
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:25,280
that he's inspecting something and you

2127
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:29,239
also get a hint that there are many

2128
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:33,559
parallel processes going on in his brain

2129
02:09:29,239 --> 02:09:36,760
so in his mode as Inspector now back to

2130
02:09:33,559 --> 02:09:39,360
leads and MIT I think many many of us

2131
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:42,119
have experienced what ASU also mentioned

2132
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:45,079
in the morning San jooy roaming the

2133
02:09:42,119 --> 02:09:48,880
corridors finding an open door or

2134
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:48,880
catching you

2135
02:09:49,159 --> 02:09:54,119
uh uh let's see

2136
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:56,360
okay I'm getting a message that the

2137
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:59,880
picture is not properly

2138
02:09:56,360 --> 02:10:05,079
shared uh my zoom says that it

2139
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:08,480
is supposedly shared okay

2140
02:10:05,079 --> 02:10:08,480
um is it

2141
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,679
visible

2142
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:22,239
no let me do stop share and share again

2143
02:10:22,599 --> 02:10:28,719
you are screen sharing participants can

2144
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,719
see it

2145
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:36,360
okay is it there

2146
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:36,360
no

2147
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:47,880
h okay let me try once more or I can

2148
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:51,880
send it to send the file to someone

2149
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:51,880
and H

2150
02:10:53,719 --> 02:10:59,960
it's

2151
02:10:55,360 --> 02:11:03,119
on okay good let me continue then so

2152
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:05,119
sanjo with this observant look he would

2153
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:07,679
either grab you in the corridor or find

2154
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:10,280
an open door and come in and ask so

2155
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:12,880
what's going on what's new what's

2156
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:15,880
important so I think a good way of

2157
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:17,880
keeping his legacy alive is whenever

2158
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:21,000
we're working on something and want to

2159
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:23,159
crystallize it to something basic and uh

2160
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,040
find a way to describe it in a short

2161
02:11:23,159 --> 02:11:28,880
succinct way just think how would you

2162
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:33,199
answer s Joy if he were to suddenly show

2163
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:36,679
up and and ask you so what's up how do

2164
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:38,960
you summarize it in few words so of

2165
02:11:36,679 --> 02:11:41,400
course as people keep mentioning San Joy

2166
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:45,079
was about the big picture he was a true

2167
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:48,079
scholar I try to look at said in the big

2168
02:11:45,079 --> 02:11:50,239
picture and that did really pay off for

2169
02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:53,280
lots of us and the community and for

2170
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:55,679
lads I mean he would always encourage to

2171
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:57,880
explore new directions and provide

2172
02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:59,880
leadership and famously he launched the

2173
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:02,320
center for intelligent control it

2174
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:05,920
involved leads it involved also Harvard

2175
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:08,880
Brown and people from seale and was

2176
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:11,119
trying to develop a coherent but broader

2177
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:14,400
vision of the field of systems and

2178
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:17,280
control so the center was ahead of the

2179
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:19,679
of the times in many ways uh it was

2180
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:22,360
formative for many people it did play a

2181
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:24,400
huge role in my career here uh the

2182
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:26,320
presence of that Center and I think for

2183
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:29,679
many others as well and for the

2184
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:32,920
community overall but now going Beyond

2185
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:36,040
math and science uh sanjoy was basically

2186
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:38,719
a citizen across multiple scales so a

2187
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:41,199
citizen of the University a citizen of

2188
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:44,119
our intellectual community and the

2189
02:12:41,199 --> 02:12:47,960
citizen of the world so the university

2190
02:12:44,119 --> 02:12:51,520
scale he had strong uh with a healthy

2191
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:55,000
classical dose of academic values clear

2192
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:58,480
sense of what's worth doing and a clear

2193
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:01,559
distaste for noisy diversion and he was

2194
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:04,480
not afraid to tell things like they were

2195
02:13:01,559 --> 02:13:07,920
uh sometimes with a dry British style

2196
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:10,239
humor or with a sharp philosophical

2197
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:12,880
quotation uh somebody already mentioned

2198
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:16,079
a quotation from San Joy I do remember

2199
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:18,559
another one that he made uh while there

2200
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:20,440
were some sort of political type

2201
02:13:18,559 --> 02:13:22,280
discussions around the department and

2202
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:26,159
some people feeling that they were on

2203
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:30,760
the upswing and San Joy said well there

2204
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:34,079
is a tide in the Affairs of men meaning

2205
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:37,559
that one should remain humble and

2206
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:41,159
grounded and not to feel too a bullant

2207
02:13:37,559 --> 02:13:44,719
if things seem to go one way or

2208
02:13:41,159 --> 02:13:47,360
another so if we think of San Joy a

2209
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:50,040
little more holistically basically was a

2210
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:52,679
wonderful person a well-rounded human

2211
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:56,040
being or people already mentioned about

2212
02:13:52,679 --> 02:13:57,920
his bread I still remember him that he

2213
02:13:56,040 --> 02:14:01,639
would always recommend a new book to

2214
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:04,679
read on sociology politics history

2215
02:14:01,639 --> 02:14:09,360
philosophy he was a true

2216
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:12,679
humanist uh yes I would I I guess I

2217
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:16,239
share in common Peter fal's uh

2218
02:14:12,679 --> 02:14:20,320
experience that I've also SJ recommended

2219
02:14:16,239 --> 02:14:21,719
for rori and read his novel and actually

2220
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:24,800
this week

2221
02:14:21,719 --> 02:14:27,199
maybe because of the feelings around

2222
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:30,280
this event I took another history book

2223
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:33,800
that sanjoy had recommended a few years

2224
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:36,119
back so having those conversations wond

2225
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:39,599
starting little lightly on the academics

2226
02:14:36,119 --> 02:14:41,840
but then going into World politics and

2227
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:44,599
philosophy and all that that was an

2228
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:47,760
amazing experience so time with San jooy

2229
02:14:44,599 --> 02:14:50,559
was always a very rich

2230
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:52,079
experience and sanjoy was a citizen of

2231
02:14:50,559 --> 02:14:54,679
the world

2232
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:59,000
Cosmopolitan as Cosmopolitan as anyone

2233
02:14:54,679 --> 02:15:01,199
could be what does that mean okay uh

2234
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:05,599
since sanjoy liked physic physical

2235
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:09,079
analogies so sanjoy had plenty of very

2236
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:12,520
definite intellectual momentum and so

2237
02:15:09,079 --> 02:15:15,239
the uncertainly principle means that his

2238
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:18,320
position would be impossible to pinned

2239
02:15:15,239 --> 02:15:21,480
down with Precision so he was everywhere

2240
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:24,599
his life crisscrossed the world

2241
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:26,239
uh having life in India in Italy in

2242
02:15:24,599 --> 02:15:28,719
England

2243
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:32,000
everywhere and on the Cosmopolitan side

2244
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:33,000
also way before recommendation systems

2245
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,480
were

2246
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:39,639
invented uh sanjoy was there for any

2247
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:42,239
major city in the world he would be the

2248
02:15:39,639 --> 02:15:45,320
one to recommend special hotels and

2249
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:49,880
restaurants not the fancy ones but the

2250
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:52,800
hidden gems with style and class so he

2251
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:55,159
had class in a sort of oldw world

2252
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:58,119
fashion in a fashion that's maybe

2253
02:15:55,159 --> 02:16:02,840
disappearing these days he had this

2254
02:15:58,119 --> 02:16:05,520
sharp observant eye but also enigmatic

2255
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:06,440
sometimes as is captured in this picture

2256
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:11,599
that I

2257
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:15,800
posted so uh my wife and I spent a lot

2258
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:18,119
of time with s joy and with Adriana back

2259
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:21,239
then uh they

2260
02:16:18,119 --> 02:16:24,119
really enjoyed our kids as well when

2261
02:16:21,239 --> 02:16:26,079
they were present we had a wonderful

2262
02:16:24,119 --> 02:16:28,159
time with San jooy in many parts of the

2263
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:30,880
world with lots and lots of fond

2264
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:33,359
memories he was a very gracious horse

2265
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:35,639
showing us around Florence and of course

2266
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:38,559
knowing anything everything about that

2267
02:16:35,639 --> 02:16:40,840
City that we should know about we did

2268
02:16:38,559 --> 02:16:44,280
stroll with him through London he

2269
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:46,399
visited Us in Greece and speaking about

2270
02:16:44,280 --> 02:16:48,639
the visit of Greece people talked about

2271
02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:51,240
lots of activities of San Joy from

2272
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:55,000
Sports to intellectuals and all that

2273
02:16:51,240 --> 02:17:00,599
nobody mentions dancing so while in

2274
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:05,160
Greece we even got if I can get the next

2275
02:17:00,599 --> 02:17:08,120
page uh okay we managed to get some joy

2276
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:11,439
into a Greek line

2277
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:14,160
dance uh would be person who would

2278
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:17,479
immerse in everything maybe sometimes

2279
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:21,200
keeping in the depth of his mind some

2280
02:17:17,479 --> 02:17:23,840
distance and still observing but he was

2281
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:26,719
open to any kind of experience in any

2282
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:29,840
kind of culture and situation he was

2283
02:17:26,719 --> 02:17:33,040
full of life his advice his values were

2284
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:35,719
Priceless had a huge impact to me so I

2285
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:39,359
feel that it was a big honor big

2286
02:17:35,719 --> 02:17:42,800
pleasure that we crossed paths I'm I'm

2287

[Applause]

02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:16,880
you okay next speaker we have um ve

2296
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:29,960
I just made a few jottings mainly from

2297
02:18:27,559 --> 02:18:32,920
my personal experience which are kind of

2298
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:35,679
instantiations of a lot that has already

2299
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:37,319
been said so we know that he took a lot

2300
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:40,160
of interest in his students

2301
02:18:37,319 --> 02:18:41,679
collaborators and so on and not only

2302
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:43,760
academically but also helped them with

2303
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:47,040
their careers and sometimes in personal

2304
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:48,880
problems as well but he sometimes helped

2305
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:51,479
people whom he did not really know well

2306
02:18:48,880 --> 02:18:54,399
also that includes me

2307
02:18:51,479 --> 02:18:57,599
the first time I met him was in Holland

2308
02:18:54,399 --> 02:19:00,000
and I my plan when I finished my PhD I

2309
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:02,559
was decided to go back to India I wanted

2310
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,800
to spend a year in Europe and then head

2311
02:19:02,559 --> 02:19:08,599
back and there was a position in tent

2312
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:11,160
which had been advertised I applied for

2313
02:19:08,599 --> 02:19:14,479
that got it and ended up in Holland and

2314
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:16,639
in the meantime lot of my friends and

2315
02:19:14,479 --> 02:19:21,200
seniors and including my

2316
02:19:16,639 --> 02:19:23,599
adviser they kept sort of

2317
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,960
trying to convince me that it was not a

2318
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:27,960
wise move to just pack up and go back to

2319
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:30,639
India like that so I was a bit jittery

2320
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:32,760
and I sent a few feelers to couple of

2321
02:19:30,639 --> 02:19:35,000
places in India and the responses were

2322
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:37,639
also not encouraging and then I met

2323
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,760
sanjoy so I introduced myself and he say

2324
02:19:37,639 --> 02:19:41,719
yes PR has told me about you I heard you

2325
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:44,399
are going back to India so he said yes

2326
02:19:41,719 --> 02:19:45,920
very good so he says this first time

2327
02:19:44,399 --> 02:19:47,800
somebody is actually encouraging me to

2328
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,600
do that and then he said do you know

2329
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:50,960
that Tata in of fundamental resarch is

2330
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,080
starting a new center in Applied

2331
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:54,439
Mathematics why don't you apply there so

2332
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:55,200
I didn't know about that so I said okay

2333
02:19:54,439 --> 02:19:58,240
I'll

2334
02:19:55,200 --> 02:20:00,920
apply please do and I'll write write a

2335
02:19:58,240 --> 02:20:02,640
letter for you and that was it I just

2336
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:06,160
after so much stress I just walked into

2337
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:08,640
a job without having to do much just one

2338
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:10,520
letter from him did it that was one

2339
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:13,439
experience other thing that has been

2340
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:16,520
mentioned how he a very curious person

2341
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:19,160
used to just keep trying to em from

2342
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:22,680
wherever he went some new facts factoids

2343
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:24,600
Etc and was very good at connecting them

2344
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:27,760
that's another thing I benefited from

2345
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:30,080
one one several times actually but one

2346
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:32,840
incident with incident which sticks to

2347
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:36,439
my mind is some prity conference where I

2348
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:38,600
had some looking for some some result I

2349
02:20:36,439 --> 02:20:41,319
don't remember the details and Professor

2350
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:43,640
Wan was there I asked him is such and

2351
02:20:41,319 --> 02:20:46,960
such a result available he thought for a

2352
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:48,960
while and he said I don't think so after

2353
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:51,479
some while he walked away Sanjay was

2354
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:53,920
standing next to us seeing nothing and

2355
02:20:51,479 --> 02:20:57,600
then he says have you looked at so and

2356
02:20:53,920 --> 02:21:01,240
so paper and that was it correct

2357
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:04,160
hint then at one point he had me and Tom

2358
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:07,840
Richardson and ofer Juni all of us

2359
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:10,720
invited to Pisa together and there was

2360
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:12,439
one incident which you know his wife

2361
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:17,120
offer he left by then he was not there

2362
02:21:12,439 --> 02:21:20,000
full time so Tom and I and S and Adriana

2363
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:22,200
he took us for dinner to some fancy

2364
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,040
place I think it was in Florence and it

2365
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:25,880
was kind of uphill on top of a hill and

2366
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:28,080
you couldn't drive all the way up so you

2367
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:30,399
had to park somewhere and then we sort

2368
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:32,720
of climbed our way up and suddenly

2369
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:34,800
Adriana started feeling that he had not

2370
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:38,720
locked the car door she got very

2371
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:41,600
agitated SJ locked the car door and kept

2372
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:44,399
getting more and more worked up then s

2373
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:46,880
says take it easy what's the worst that

2374
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:49,080
can happen somebody will take the car

2375
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:51,080
away that was

2376
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:54,040
it this another

2377
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:56,479
sort of odd incident which also shows

2378
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:59,439
his character there was one conference

2379
02:21:56,479 --> 02:22:01,399
where this was in mombay in fact and

2380
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:04,359
there's one very senior Professor from

2381
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:07,319
one of the institutes there probably I

2382
02:22:04,359 --> 02:22:10,640
think probably was sin I'm not sure but

2383
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:13,040
he gave a talk which was just bizarre

2384
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:15,200
and there was very lot of distinguished

2385
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:17,319
audience it was a major International

2386
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:19,560
Conference and they

2387
02:22:17,319 --> 02:22:21,760
stunned just a really strange talk and

2388
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:23,600
then at the end of it gentleman was

2389
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:26,760
expectantly looking at audience for

2390
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:29,680
something sanj raises his hand asked

2391
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:31,359
some some generic question and the guy

2392
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:33,560
said something and some small

2393
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:36,920
conversation and S thanked him and the

2394
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:39,479
guy went away feeling good it just the a

2395
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:42,080
gesture gentlemanly gesture which really

2396
02:22:39,479 --> 02:22:42,080
stuck in my

2397
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:50,080
mind really sort of awful talk absurd in

2398
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:51,000
a way but he did not make the person

2399
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:53,880
feel

2400
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,880
uncomfortable at

2401
02:22:54,399 --> 02:22:59,880
all okay then finally used to visit

2402
02:22:57,319 --> 02:23:01,520
India a lot so I kept changing my jobs

2403
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:03,960
and everywhere I was there San has

2404
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:07,600
visited that's T of fundamental research

2405
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:09,560
IND of Science and I and he s on many

2406
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:11,720
advisory roles review committees and so

2407
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:13,720
on he always took these very seriously

2408
02:23:11,720 --> 02:23:16,880
his reports were detailed

2409
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:19,560
and sort of accurate I mean exactly you

2410
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:21,560
would recommend what is needed and so on

2411
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:23,479
and also you used to talk to he would

2412
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:24,880
insist on meeting students so we would

2413
02:23:23,479 --> 02:23:27,040
give him an office he would sit all day

2414
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:29,279
there and students would sort of sign up

2415
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:31,640
for slots to talk to him

2416
02:23:29,279 --> 02:23:33,760
and you would sort of give them advice

2417
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:35,080
and that's one point when I I was

2418
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:36,760
sometimes witnessed to some of this

2419
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:40,760
sometimes I felt that it was too nice

2420
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:43,840
and should sometimes become blunt for

2421
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:46,240
one thing this often you find that our

2422
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:48,399
students it's partly because of sort of

2423
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:50,960
being geographically cut off and not

2424
02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:53,560
enough of travel and so on

2425
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:56,240
they often get stuck in some kind of

2426
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:58,439
time War let's say some problem which

2427
02:23:56,240 --> 02:24:00,479
was hot long time back and there are

2428
02:23:58,439 --> 02:24:02,800
maybe some technicalities left which may

2429
02:24:00,479 --> 02:24:05,600
be even very difficult they take them up

2430
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:08,680
and solve them but nobody is interested

2431
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:10,560
but they don't know that in full

2432
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:12,560
sincerity sort of devoting a lot of time

2433
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:15,560
and effort and talent to solve this

2434
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:17,560
things so I was in one such meeting when

2435
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:19,720
he he was trying to persuade the student

2436
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:21,680
that okay this is interesting thing but

2437
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:25,040
you should be doing something more

2438
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:26,680
relevant or more current Etc I think the

2439
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:29,160
message did not go through and I did

2440
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:30,279
feel that it should have been blunt

2441
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:33,680
anyway

2442
02:24:30,279 --> 02:24:36,240
so nicity has its limitations in the

2443
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:39,680
sense that cannot achieve everything I

2444
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:39,680
think that's all I had to say thank

2445
02:24:43,279 --> 02:24:47,520
you joh bar

2446
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:57,520
thank you very much for organizing this

2447
02:24:56,319 --> 02:24:59,720
tribute to

2448
02:24:57,520 --> 02:25:02,200
shanjo I think there are about two

2449
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:04,000
people in the room that they know Shan

2450
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:08,120
jooy as much as I

2451
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,840
do because Alan and Peter right I don't

2452
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:13,600
think there's anybody that new sanjoy

2453
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:15,080
before 1970 in the room so let me tell

2454
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:18,080
you a little bit about the story because

2455
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:20,319
we sanjo and I go a long way first I'll

2456
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:22,680
talk about technical things and some

2457
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:25,040
jokes about technical things so I came

2458
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:27,680
to the US in

2459
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:29,880
1970 after a lot of advice to come here

2460
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:32,279
because of the wonderful environment at

2461
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:34,000
MIT and Harvard and I'll give you some

2462
02:25:32,279 --> 02:25:36,640
parts that Alan mentioned also they were

2463
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,319
not technical from that environment and

2464
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:39,640
I didn't know what I wanted to study I I

2465
02:25:38,319 --> 02:25:42,240
knew I had to do something about

2466
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:46,080
mathematics physics and Engineering then

2467
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:49,120
I linked with Roger at Harvard first and

2468
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:51,000
those days uh Roger sanjoy and Yan were

2469
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:53,439
here and you will get a lot of

2470
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:56,240
interesting courses and ideas and

2471
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:59,640
questions I met sanjoy in

2472
02:25:56,240 --> 02:26:00,760
19771 that year he became What I Call my

2473
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:04,720
second

2474
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:06,720
advisor and through shanjo I I I met and

2475
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:09,359
linked with my third adviser which was

2476
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:11,600
PR Vara I'm telling you all that because

2477
02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:13,880
I lost all three of them in one year and

2478
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:17,240
it was to me devastating when that

2479
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:19,600
happened s became very good friends and

2480
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:22,160
yes I'll will tell you some interesting

2481
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:24,800
stories about about how I answer some of

2482
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:26,319
his questions what's new although some

2483
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,359
of these questions were given to me

2484
02:26:26,319 --> 02:26:30,800
while we were riding the bus from

2485
02:26:28,359 --> 02:26:33,800
Harvard Square to MIT took some courses

2486
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:35,680
and uh it's interesting so technically

2487
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:38,080
what always impressed me with Ando even

2488
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:40,600
today it was he's passionate about

2489
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:43,359
trying to understand systems control

2490
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:45,680
information Theory all unified in one

2491
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:47,399
way going all the way back to Gar

2492
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:49,880
Kramer's you know directed information

2493
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:53,319
which later surfaced in the thesis with

2494
02:26:49,880 --> 02:26:55,160
m and Nuna Martins and so on so forth

2495
02:26:53,319 --> 02:26:57,640
The Duality of information and control

2496
02:26:55,160 --> 02:27:00,760
he was struggling with that later with

2497
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:03,040
Nigel Newton and many others and the

2498
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:04,640
continues puru of connections with

2499
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,640
mathematical physics and biology and the

2500
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:08,840
fact that the biggest mistake you can

2501
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:10,520
make in life is to think about humans as

2502
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:13,160
ad as causal

2503
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:15,359
systems okay and and what this affects

2504
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:18,200
statistics and other stuff and then

2505
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:20,359
economics philosophy and sociology and

2506
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:22,000
politics no matter what the differ

2507
02:27:20,359 --> 02:27:24,120
difficult subject was what impressed me

2508
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,840
with Ando and already was mentioned was

2509
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:30,000
that he was calm and almost stoic okay

2510
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:32,520
so he will make a statement as as as M

2511
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,560
said and then he will stop then you you

2512
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:38,720
say what do I do now okay and I'll give

2513
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:40,920
you some examples so imagine this this

2514
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:43,760
picture okay two people sitting on the

2515
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:47,479
back row of the bus from Harvard Square

2516
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:50,319
to it talking about things like Hardy

2517
02:27:47,479 --> 02:27:53,560
functions the corona theorem

2518
02:27:50,319 --> 02:27:56,760
in PE you know Nas for Theory the

2519
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:58,080
generalization of of shift and shift

2520
02:27:56,760 --> 02:28:00,439
register

2521
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:02,200
synthesis not paying any attention to

2522
02:28:00,439 --> 02:28:03,840
what the environment was who was around

2523
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:05,240
and whatever okay can you imagine what

2524
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:07,240
the other people thought about us and

2525
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:12,640
that was going on every almost two or

2526
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:15,080
three times a week okay now in uh after

2527
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:18,000
I left from here although the The Roots

2528
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:20,399
can go back to sanoi I got involved with

2529
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:22,760
uh because of my colleagues at Maryland

2530
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:25,600
and this connects me to Max razinski

2531
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:27,520
on Quantum estimation information

2532
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,680
because we had to solve problems with

2533
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:32,960
communication with

2534
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:35,680
lasers and uh that problem is different

2535
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:38,279
than what we do in signals and systems

2536
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:40,439
because uh in addition to the algorithm

2537
02:28:38,279 --> 02:28:43,000
you have to find the

2538
02:28:40,439 --> 02:28:44,479
measurements and even those days with

2539
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:47,479
shanjo who connected this things to

2540
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:49,880
multiagent systems and so on so forth

2541
02:28:47,479 --> 02:28:51,720
and I remember in my sabatical I came to

2542
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:54,760
my about three times and then for a full

2543
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:58,319
year in 98 we're in the room with sanjoy

2544
02:28:54,760 --> 02:29:00,960
and anansa at taond and a few others

2545
02:28:58,319 --> 02:29:03,399
talking about things right and this

2546
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:06,000
connection say what they mean s turn to

2547
02:29:03,399 --> 02:29:08,040
the group and says what is

2548
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:10,240
measurement he

2549
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:12,399
stopped and now we know that this

2550
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:14,160
question goes very deep even to certain

2551
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:18,399
discussions that happen in mathematical

2552
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:21,000
physics today all right so he then uh

2553
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:22,760
what came about in in terms of history

2554
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
and some people mentioned it already in

2555
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:26,720
their interaction with sanoi came n

2556
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:29,520
linear filtering

2557
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:31,200
right so there was all kind of

2558
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:34,479
excitement because a fellow by the name

2559
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:37,720
of benis from Babs came up with a

2560
02:29:34,479 --> 02:29:40,439
so-called first nonlinear dynamical

2561
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:43,240
filter so uh in many groups in the

2562
02:29:40,439 --> 02:29:45,560
country including MIT and Harvard a

2563
02:29:43,240 --> 02:29:47,680
super conductivity like competition came

2564
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:50,840
to figure out who is going to find new

2565
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:53,240
finite Dimension filters okay

2566
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:55,720
unfortunately and then we went to dunan

2567
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:58,000
Mor s zai equations for those of you who

2568
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:59,840
were around at the time this is totally

2569
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:02,120
inspired by the way physicists turn

2570
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:05,040
nonlinear problems into linear Problems

2571
02:30:02,120 --> 02:30:07,160
by treating unnormalized

2572
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:09,080
equations unfortunately all the results

2573
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:10,120
we came up with were were negative

2574
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,960
whether you look at them from Le

2575
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:14,240
algebras or inv Varian Theory or

2576
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:16,680
whatever the result was you have the

2577
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:19,319
gasan linear case and everything else

2578
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:23,000
okay and and S was in the middle of this

2579
02:30:19,319 --> 02:30:24,600
trying to to guide the abstractions of

2580
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:26,200
the problem and what was the right

2581
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:28,600
statistics and the right

2582
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:30,760
formulation all right and then around

2583
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:33,640
the same time of course Sanji who had a

2584
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:35,960
very deep interest in in these problems

2585
02:30:33,640 --> 02:30:38,359
came about with Deborah alinger with a

2586
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:39,840
solution to the Innovations problem and

2587
02:30:38,359 --> 02:30:41,720
I still remember the arguments between

2588
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:43,720
him and kalampur on whether it was

2589
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:45,240
actually solved or not this was the the

2590
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:47,640
problem of whether I get the innovation

2591
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:49,200
in the general diffusion you get all the

2592
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:51,040
sigma Fields constructed and so on so

2593
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:53,200
forth and the other thing was in the

2594
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:54,720
variational theory of filtering and the

2595
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:58,200
path integral representations of

2596
02:30:54,720 --> 02:31:00,439
filtering with f cat formula which today

2597
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:03,319
has reincarnated itself in what's called

2598
02:31:00,439 --> 02:31:05,359
path integral control and mppi for path

2599
02:31:03,319 --> 02:31:07,040
finding and all that okay just just look

2600
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:10,640
at the time right we're talking about

2601
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:13,120
7080s and now okay and then he

2602
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:15,359
introduced me to Nelson stochastic

2603
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:17,439
mechanics which basically says yeah

2604
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:20,279
there's this a for qu mechanics but you

2605
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:22,600
can also think about it as an AS it's a

2606
02:31:20,279 --> 02:31:24,120
different very strange version where you

2607
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:26,640
actually connect with stochastic

2608
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:28,680
mechanics to make it simple for you you

2609
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:30,240
take the parabolic equations of of

2610
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:32,479
control change time imaginary they

2611
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:34,200
become scar equation go back and forth

2612
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:37,160
and this has come back again to try to

2613
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:40,800
see if one can develop sort of a theory

2614
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:45,720
of analog quum Computing away from qits

2615
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:45,720
okay so it

2616
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:50,680
uh the negative part was okay we didn't

2617
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:53,479
prove anything that existed time F the

2618
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:55,760
positive thing is that this pushed us to

2619
02:31:53,479 --> 02:31:57,960
to understand the generalization of the

2620
02:31:55,760 --> 02:32:01,160
H Infinity Theory to linear and set

2621
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:03,479
value and all systems by sanjo asking me

2622
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:05,560
every time we meet what is the system

2623
02:32:03,479 --> 02:32:07,520
theoretic interpretation of the two

2624
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:10,800
equations what's the analog in no linear

2625
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:13,120
case how much you can do it okay and we

2626
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:15,040
developed this the later on and I think

2627
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:19,000
at the end he was satisfied

2628
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:21,120
okay uh even in the work I did with uh

2629
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,040
internet overs it where we were the

2630
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,760
first to to do internet over satellite

2631
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:26,800
when everybody was calling us idiots and

2632
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:29,439
stupid and all that stuff when I came

2633
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:31,240
here in '98 I remember I see in the

2634
02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:34,040
corridor and I was trying to explain to

2635
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:36,279
Bob Gallagher and to sanjoy what we did

2636
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:38,640
and sanjoy pops up and says what exactly

2637
02:32:36,279 --> 02:32:40,560
did you do I don't understand and then

2638
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:43,279
he kept on through the year until I was

2639
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:45,080
able to explain the problem as a control

2640
02:32:43,279 --> 02:32:46,880
problem and the fact that we cheated to

2641
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:48,880
solve it by changing the physics and the

2642
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:50,680
control okay and then he was satisfied

2643
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:52,760
I'm telling you that because what I

2644
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:55,520
admired in San jooy is the

2645
02:32:52,760 --> 02:32:57,520
calmness and the ability to persuade you

2646
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,920
to go away from the immediacy of the

2647
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:01,640
problem and think a little bit outside

2648
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:03,359
the box and try to see if you can see

2649
02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:06,399
more generality and if you can see

2650
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:08,479
connections and I and I think he

2651
02:33:06,399 --> 02:33:11,160
influenced me a lot another example

2652
02:33:08,479 --> 02:33:12,960
which I learned from him sto was in

2653
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:15,120
Florence but I think he was really in

2654
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:17,319
Florence because he admired the colal

2655
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,920
Superior in Pisa and the mathematicians

2656
02:33:17,319 --> 02:33:21,640
there I mean maybe that's not true but I

2657
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:23,760
learned from him the mark conjecture

2658
02:33:21,640 --> 02:33:25,680
about Imaging which says that you can

2659
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:27,359
reconstruct an image by the

2660
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:30,560
multi-resolution

2661
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:33,640
edges and then he of course worked with

2662
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:35,279
um the Georg theory of variational image

2663
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:37,279
segmentation and so on so forth and he

2664
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:38,720
had somebody here by the name of Tom

2665
02:33:37,279 --> 02:33:42,479
Richardson who did the physic on the

2666
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:44,680
subject okay again think about it okay

2667
02:33:42,479 --> 02:33:46,479
you take a problem like IM computer

2668
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:47,960
vision and you try to think of it from a

2669
02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:50,840
variational perspective and you connect

2670
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:54,600
to some of the deeper theories and um

2671
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:57,200
you know get some new fundamental uh

2672
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:58,920
results in this area and he did it by

2673
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:01,960
minimizing the so-call man foram

2674
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:02,640
functional okay by by these theories and

2675
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:04,840
I

2676
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:07,000
always was very impressed with Tom

2677
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:08,399
Richardson's thesis that was before he

2678
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,800
turned to wireless although I still

2679
02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:12,880
think he did some very great things in

2680
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:15,880
Wireless and I close with some examples

2681
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:18,560
of things outside science SOI was a

2682
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:21,240
great friend Mentor colleague and

2683
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:23,760
reviewer and and he was always as you

2684
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:26,000
mentioned before calm couldn't get

2685
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:28,240
excited I couldn't get Sano to be very

2686
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,680
passionate I'm Greek right so I I get

2687
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,800
very I had short fusion and all that

2688
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:33,720
stuff you know all my sins right so it

2689
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:35,720
was always it was always what we call in

2690
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:37,800
Greece stoic okay so he will ask

2691
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:40,240
something and he will ask you to

2692
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:42,399
philosophize let me give you an example

2693
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:45,160
I won't mention names because you may

2694
02:34:42,399 --> 02:34:48,080
guess so we were in a review of a

2695
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:49,720
department so somebody who I believe was

2696
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:52,080
the chair stands up and says you know

2697
02:34:49,720 --> 02:34:55,080
I'll do XYZ and so on so forth and I'll

2698
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:57,160
get the Department to be top 10 and so

2699
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:58,760
Jo thinks about it says yeah there are

2700
02:34:57,160 --> 02:35:00,319
some other people now that they are top

2701
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:01,560
10 okay so can you tell me who you're

2702
02:35:00,319 --> 02:35:03,500
going to replace and how you're going to

2703
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:05,960
do it and then he stopped

2704
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:09,880
[Laughter]

2705
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:12,479
again soccer in Cambridge Alan mentioned

2706
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:14,160
it I want to add some things all right

2707
02:35:12,479 --> 02:35:16,720
so of course sanjy was coming all

2708
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:18,600
perfectly uh addressed and playing all

2709
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:20,479
the games with the rules and so and so

2710
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:22,680
forth

2711
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:25,800
yeah now you know had somebody named Yan

2712
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:28,040
Williams who will come and grab my elbow

2713
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:30,160
in corner kicks and try to pull me down

2714
02:35:28,040 --> 02:35:31,840
okay because he was shorter than me and

2715
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:34,200
he will not let me to go ahead there and

2716
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:36,720
sanj will come and say foul okay from

2717
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:38,800
the other side of the field and then

2718
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:40,359
also he will comment about Tamir Bazar

2719
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:42,359
who just came from turkey and he was

2720
02:35:40,359 --> 02:35:44,520
always coming he was playing soccer in

2721
02:35:42,359 --> 02:35:46,640
Turkey he will come in with professional

2722
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:49,760
attire where the rest of us were very

2723
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:51,880
informal with not a proper shoes and and

2724
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:53,720
he will he was calling it the Turkish

2725
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:55,840
Terror okay when you would come down the

2726
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:58,000
field okay nobody could stop him and

2727
02:35:55,840 --> 02:36:00,080
then we had somebody from Australia darl

2728
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,840
Williamson who is a fellow student of

2729
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:05,319
mine who will give you open field rugby

2730
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:06,720
type tackles in soccer and then we'll

2731
02:36:05,319 --> 02:36:08,520
say Dar you don't that's not how you

2732
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:12,279
play soccer oh I'm sorry I forgot about

2733
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:13,359
it okay nobody mentioned about I think

2734
02:36:12,279 --> 02:36:16,120
it was mentioned but I want to say

2735
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:19,760
something specific about San Joy's

2736
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:21,960
passion with cooking I cook too but he

2737
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:24,439
is Way Beyond me okay and he went

2738
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:28,240
actually to a special school in France

2739
02:36:24,439 --> 02:36:29,840
in font Blau to take cooking lessons

2740
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:32,120
unfortunately I didn't have any chance

2741
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:34,600
to observe whether this unhan is cooking

2742
02:36:32,120 --> 02:36:36,560
talents or whatever all right and then I

2743
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:39,240
want to mention Adriana of course okay

2744
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:42,439
Adriana was the um what we call the

2745
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:43,760
human intervention in human in in San

2746
02:36:42,439 --> 02:36:46,439
Joy

2747
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:47,960
driving sometimes Sano will drive and

2748
02:36:46,439 --> 02:36:49,800
we'll get you a conversation and then

2749
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:52,520
you can see that random walk was Tak

2750
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:54,720
over and Adriana will come and say Sano

2751
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:59,479
what what you're doing okay we're in a

2752
02:36:54,720 --> 02:37:01,880
car in in a kind nice way all right I

2753
02:36:59,479 --> 02:37:04,600
will close by remembering sanjoy as

2754
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:07,160
somebody who deeply cared about

2755
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:10,680
students and Advising them and not just

2756
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:12,760
for a few years almost for life and I

2757
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:15,160
really always remember fondly these

2758
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:16,960
encounters the exchanges and the

2759
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:19,500
influence he had on Me Through The Years

2760
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:26,180
even until now thank you very much

2761
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:26,180
[Applause]

2762
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:40,680
Mar thank you uh I just have very few

2763
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:43,200
remarks I did not know sanj for

2764
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:45,720
extremely long time but I sort of feel

2765
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:48,840
obliged to say something that hasn't

2766
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:51,600
been mentioned this morning he everybody

2767
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:53,439
talked about theorems and I think I have

2768
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:55,720
some slides everybody talks about

2769
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:58,399
theorems and proofs and so forth and

2770
02:37:55,720 --> 02:38:00,640
abstractions but actually I come from

2771
02:37:58,399 --> 02:38:05,120
Power assistance Community where people

2772
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:07,479
know of sanj's early PhD student Tom

2773
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:09,600
diako who actually introduced the

2774
02:38:07,479 --> 02:38:12,600
framework for Power Systems which

2775
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:15,399
industry has adapted so that is a huge

2776
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:18,640
impact so I just want to share that very

2777
02:38:15,399 --> 02:38:20,720
little with you so I want to talk about

2778
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:24,800
professor mitter impact on on

2779
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:28,920
applications on Power Systems so he

2780
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:33,279
trained this very person who became very

2781
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:35,279
famous uh person in um software for

2782
02:38:33,279 --> 02:38:39,800
control centers in Power Systems Tom

2783
02:38:35,279 --> 02:38:41,880
dako came from Philippines and uh this

2784
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:44,720
happened at Cas Western that's one of

2785
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:47,000
his first earlier jobs it was at the

2786
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:49,439
time when actually systems at kage

2787
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:53,800
Western were Golden Era they were left

2788
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:57,399
fovi mesarovic and many other people and

2789
02:38:53,800 --> 02:39:01,000
uh I just want to put a couple of slides

2790
02:38:57,399 --> 02:39:02,600
to show these industry knows that they

2791
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:05,680
go by these rules that's how they

2792
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:10,160
operate now and that was sanjy and sanj

2793
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:12,359
student Tom diako so basically what Tom

2794
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:14,640
diako did for his PhD thesis he

2795
02:39:12,359 --> 02:39:17,080
introduced this framework of adaptive

2796
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:19,840
reliability control system for control

2797
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:22,520
centers of very complex Power Systems

2798
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:25,640
and so what was adaptive about this it

2799
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:27,359
was that when you have normal operation

2800
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:29,760
large complex system and everything

2801
02:39:27,359 --> 02:39:31,600
works you still prepare things in a

2802
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:34,720
preventive way just in case something

2803
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:37,520
happen and that became this uh famous

2804
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:39,640
concept of n minus one security if one

2805
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:41,640
large component fails the system still

2806
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:44,279
operates and customers are not

2807
02:39:41,640 --> 02:39:47,520
interrupted then emergency state is when

2808
02:39:44,279 --> 02:39:49,520
you have a lot of equipment lost and uh

2809
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,200
then you have to apply different methods

2810
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:54,240
different models and so forth

2811
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:56,600
restorative is when After the Blackout

2812
02:39:54,240 --> 02:40:00,560
when things have fallen apart how do you

2813
02:39:56,600 --> 02:40:02,560
bring it back this was Tom liakos first

2814
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:05,800
P one of the first PhD students came

2815
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:08,920
from the industry and many people

2816
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:10,920
mention about uh sanjo being in the

2817
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:13,720
background he really was in the

2818
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:15,960
background you know nurturing Tom who

2819
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:19,880
came from industry from Cleveland

2820
02:40:15,960 --> 02:40:24,319
illuminate Illuminating Company c c I at

2821
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:26,960
the time and uh they actually magically

2822
02:40:24,319 --> 02:40:29,359
changed the industry this is if you go

2823
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:31,600
to the control centers this is what's

2824
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:34,439
happening this is the rules these are

2825
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:36,960
the Frameworks that that follow

2826
02:40:34,439 --> 02:40:38,399
restorative emergency think measurements

2827
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:40,479
that you need this is how the control

2828
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:43,200
centers in the US and everywhere else

2829
02:40:40,479 --> 02:40:46,920
work so these were not theorems and

2830
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:50,200
proofs that's what works in real world

2831
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:53,520
and so it's a today's industry practice

2832
02:40:50,200 --> 02:40:57,080
and wide adoption on worldwide system in

2833
02:40:53,520 --> 02:41:00,240
in 1974 there is a very nice it Spectrum

2834
02:40:57,080 --> 02:41:05,439
paper that summarizes that so this is

2835
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:08,279
what how I knew um of sanjoy and Tom

2836
02:41:05,439 --> 02:41:11,479
before I came to MIT in

2837
02:41:08,279 --> 02:41:15,200
87 first time and

2838
02:41:11,479 --> 02:41:18,279
then uh after I came I wanted to just

2839
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:20,120
give a few personal Reflections about me

2840
02:41:18,279 --> 02:41:24,319
and Professor m

2841
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:27,279
I think he looking in the H side he was

2842
02:41:24,319 --> 02:41:29,319
a catalyst of my own research and there

2843
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:31,640
were just very few things that happened

2844
02:41:29,319 --> 02:41:34,240
along the way over long period of time

2845
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:37,680
that actually determin you know where I

2846
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:40,720
went so I for people who don't know I

2847
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:42,960
spent more than I want to admit how long

2848
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:45,000
how many decades in working on

2849
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:48,040
preventing blackouts but I was sent from

2850
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:49,560
Yugoslavia to do PhD on that how do use

2851
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:54,479
systems theory to prevent the the

2852
02:41:49,560 --> 02:41:57,800
blackouts and so I did PhD um in at wasu

2853
02:41:54,479 --> 02:42:00,680
on U basically beginning to work on the

2854
02:41:57,800 --> 02:42:02,920
intersection of systems theoretical

2855
02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:06,680
systems because that was my PhD I took

2856
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:09,319
all the control courses but then by I

2857
02:42:06,680 --> 02:42:11,560
don't know by some fate I always ended

2858
02:42:09,319 --> 02:42:15,680
up applying them to Power Systems and

2859
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:18,200
that was the the what happened and uh I

2860
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:19,960
have to say after so many years this was

2861
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:22,560
not an easy path

2862
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:25,399
because you have you you are right away

2863
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:28,840
on the intersection of theoretical stuff

2864
02:42:25,399 --> 02:42:31,479
and applications and this is I think

2865
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:35,160
where sanjo helped big way you know he

2866
02:42:31,479 --> 02:42:38,200
got to know me early on and I basically

2867
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:40,560
still do that these days so very

2868
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:44,000
thankful to sanjo for

2869
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:45,840
that uh particular help and

2870
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,080
encouragement happened and George is

2871
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:50,240
here and some other people remember when

2872
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:53,800
Fred Fey was the one who invited me to

2873
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:57,279
work in Power Systems at MIT and uh then

2874
02:42:53,800 --> 02:43:00,000
he prematurely passed and I was left by

2875
02:42:57,279 --> 02:43:02,560
myself so there was SJ who once in a

2876
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:04,319
while would come by my office and say

2877
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:06,880
what are you doing you should be doing

2878
02:43:04,319 --> 02:43:09,200
that oh do you remember Tom diako and

2879
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:12,640
you know you can have an impact and so

2880
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:15,439
forth so this is how he kept me go going

2881
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:19,720
several you know several times only but

2882
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:22,600
then I went to um to CMU and

2883
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:24,680
um basically he kept in touch we kept in

2884
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:27,680
touch a little bit but when I returned

2885
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:29,600
in 2015 it was very interesting he came

2886
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:31,720
and says oh you have to just continue

2887
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:33,240
what we started why don't you put all

2888
02:43:31,720 --> 02:43:35,359
the MIT people across different

2889
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:38,800
departments and do the brainstorming he

2890
02:43:35,359 --> 02:43:42,600
was always Community Builder so what we

2891
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:46,399
have here is the first Workshop that

2892
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:48,680
leads organized uh there and I think I

2893
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:52,479
don't remember exactly we have all those

2894
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:55,279
doc but must have been 30 people

2895
02:43:52,479 --> 02:43:57,399
proactive really working actively in the

2896
02:43:55,279 --> 02:44:00,319
area of systems across different

2897
02:43:57,399 --> 02:44:03,240
departments we we are still spread

2898
02:44:00,319 --> 02:44:06,040
through different departments but San's

2899
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:09,479
idea was let's work together and it was

2900
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:12,840
a really wonderful um wonderful uh

2901
02:44:09,479 --> 02:44:15,640
Workshop we plan to sear ja is

2902
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:17,720
encouraging us now to continue to build

2903
02:44:15,640 --> 02:44:21,800
such momentum at

2904
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:25,399
leads here he and that

2905
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:28,000
Workshop sitting in the first row with

2906
02:44:25,399 --> 02:44:29,120
participants for two days I was

2907
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,760
absolutely

2908
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:34,520
amazed

2909
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:36,840
um and just one more thing which

2910
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:40,000
happened a few years recently and

2911
02:44:36,840 --> 02:44:42,000
actually changed my uh my direction

2912
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:43,319
confirmed the direction I was going on

2913
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:46,600
people were talking about these

2914
02:44:43,319 --> 02:44:49,439
behavioral models that Yan Williams had

2915
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:52,399
he he said what's up of course and I

2916
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:55,000
told him I'm working on trying to unify

2917
02:44:52,399 --> 02:44:56,520
models for power system to simplify so

2918
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:58,680
that people can actually understand

2919
02:44:56,520 --> 02:45:00,640
without knowing all the Technologies and

2920
02:44:58,680 --> 02:45:04,359
he said why don't you go and read this

2921
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:06,800
paper I trip control magazine by Yan and

2922
02:45:04,359 --> 02:45:08,680
that's where shared variables you know

2923
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:11,000
confirm our idea of interaction

2924
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:15,399
variables in complex systems and I still

2925
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:15,399
do that that's why I'm not retired

2926
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:23,040
so just to

2927
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:25,520
close I'm really grateful for continuing

2928
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:28,240
encouragement that he has done for me

2929
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:31,000
and I will miss him very much and I

2930
02:45:28,240 --> 02:45:33,640
thank for teaching me how to persevere

2931
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
when things are hard there are lot of

2932
02:45:33,640 --> 02:45:40,000
young people here roads are not going to

2933
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:42,319
be easy but sanj found a way to actually

2934
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:45,000
keep people going and I definitely had

2935
02:45:42,319 --> 02:45:47,800
that I don't know how other people feel

2936
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:51,080
I'm sure that students at least who have

2937
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:53,359
graduated te talk seminars everything

2938
02:45:51,080 --> 02:45:56,200
looks emptier now he always was sitting

2939
02:45:53,359 --> 02:46:00,080
on Wednesdays I forget when the seminar

2940
02:45:56,200 --> 02:46:02,279
was and I also want to say in the H side

2941
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:04,279
as we get get older we really don't know

2942
02:46:02,279 --> 02:46:05,319
what we have before we lose it and

2943
02:46:04,279 --> 02:46:09,319
that's how I

2944
02:46:05,319 --> 02:46:13,520
remember uh sanjoy with my warmest

2945
02:46:09,319 --> 02:46:13,520
memories thank you

2946
02:46:30,520 --> 02:46:37,479
the thing he was most proud of was his

2947
02:46:33,720 --> 02:46:39,040
patents he had I believe two patents yes

2948
02:46:37,479 --> 02:46:43,080
he had got a

2949
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:46,960
brown yes yes and he was extremely proud

2950
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:50,279
of those much prouder than of uh uh the

2951
02:46:46,960 --> 02:46:52,960
variational approach and all CL St thank

2952
02:46:50,279 --> 02:46:55,279
you Peter I this is why I mentioned this

2953
02:46:52,960 --> 02:46:57,439
early work because it's unbelievable I

2954
02:46:55,279 --> 02:47:00,479
mean you go to control Community I've

2955
02:46:57,439 --> 02:47:02,800
been on the sides uh sidelines of

2956
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:05,840
theoretical control Community but

2957
02:47:02,800 --> 02:47:07,800
actually people don't know about this to

2958
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:09,760
go to Industry and I work a lot with

2959
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:12,600
industry I have a startup everybody

2960
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:16,120
thinks according to this that diagram

2961
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:19,240
that uh they he and Tom uh um

2962
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:21,080
conceptualized at uh at Case Western

2963
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:23,439
this is the rule you develop software

2964
02:47:21,080 --> 02:47:26,680
for preventive control for uh

2965
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:30,600
restoration and so forth and uh you know

2966
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:32,720
I just wanted to say thank sanjo for a

2967
02:47:30,600 --> 02:47:36,080
lot of things that he has helped in the

2968
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:38,800
industry one thing just maybe a little

2969
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:41,160
technical thing if you don't have these

2970
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:43,160
uh these different operating modes then

2971
02:47:41,160 --> 02:47:45,240
you end up that's what industry does

2972
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:47,560
worst case approach so they put all

2973
02:47:45,240 --> 02:47:51,080
these reserves you cannot utilize clean

2974
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:54,560
energy you cannot utilize um the least

2975
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:56,760
expensive power so one thing that I wish

2976
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:59,760
I can do before I retire is put a

2977
02:47:56,760 --> 02:48:02,880
student to compute to estimate what is

2978
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:06,040
potent saving that has come dollar

2979
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:08,359
saving that's actually come from this uh

2980
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:11,240
invention and I think what it teaches us

2981
02:48:08,359 --> 02:48:13,840
is that uh you know a lot of far out

2982
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:17,760
things that we do actually ultimately

2983
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:19,520
have big impact on on uh real world

2984
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:21,570
that's what I wanted to sh with you

2985
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:26,260
thank you thank you

2986
02:48:21,570 --> 02:48:26,260
[Applause]

2987
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:54,319
Maria hi so when I was uh preparing for

2988
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:56,399
this um I was thinking about what to say

2989
02:48:54,319 --> 02:48:59,640
um about sanjoy and his human side and I

2990
02:48:56,399 --> 02:49:04,120
find it quite difficult to you know

2991
02:48:59,640 --> 02:49:08,600
Express in words uh and I was looking

2992
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:11,160
for for for things to say and um and I

2993
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:13,399
felt a little bit lost also because he

2994
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:15,920
was you know to me and to many of us he

2995
02:49:13,399 --> 02:49:18,000
was the professor that was who was up

2996
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:20,319
there and we were the disciples that

2997
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:23,600
were down here here so he kept his

2998
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:25,359
distance so in order I I became curious

2999
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:27,720
and in order you know to jump start the

3000
02:49:25,359 --> 02:49:29,520
thing I became curious and to see what

3001
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:32,239
was the collective knowledge about San

3002
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:36,880
joy and so I did this experiment and

3003
02:49:32,239 --> 02:49:40,040
asked Chad GPT to help me and uh in the

3004
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:43,960
spirit of San Joy's investigative um you

3005
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:48,040
know inclination I want to um check if

3006
02:49:43,960 --> 02:49:50,680
uh know starting from AI there is

3007
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:52,479
something person personal that I can add

3008
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:56,359
on the collective knowledge that is

3009
02:49:52,479 --> 02:49:58,840
there so I will just uh start by reading

3010
02:49:56,359 --> 02:50:01,120
the beginning of chat GTP answer to a

3011
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:05,520
gentleman and lifelong scholar sanj

3012
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:07,800
mitter so chat GPT says We Gather to

3013
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:10,720
today to honor The Life and Legacy of a

3014
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:12,760
remarkable man Professor sanj mitter a

3015
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:14,920
gentleman a brilliant scholar and an

3016
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:16,880
inspiring Mentor whose influence

3017
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:19,800
extended far beyond the bounds of the

3018
02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:21,640
academic word in C crating his life we

3019
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:23,680
also remember the profound impact that

3020
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:26,000
he had on each of us both personally and

3021
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:28,439
professionally so it looks to me like

3022
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:30,840
rather standard perhaps not too

3023
02:50:28,439 --> 02:50:33,359
impressive opening from chat

3024
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:35,640
GPT uh but then he continues he say

3025
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:37,560
anter was more than a professor he was a

3026
02:50:35,640 --> 02:50:39,319
true intellectual giant of the fields

3027
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:41,760
and control theory systems theory

3028
02:50:39,319 --> 02:50:43,439
information theory he was work bridged

3029
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:45,920
multiple disciplines and his research

3030
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:49,200
transformed our understanding of complex

3031
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:51,800
systems and here chat GPT

3032
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:53,760
is clear that has done its own homework

3033
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:56,680
and and hit the

3034
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:58,560
target um yet despite his immense

3035
02:50:56,680 --> 02:51:00,840
contribution to Science and Technology

3036
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:03,080
it was his warmed quite humility

3037
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:06,239
graciousness and deep kindness that left

3038
02:51:03,080 --> 02:51:08,960
and the indelible mark on all of who had

3039
02:51:06,239 --> 02:51:12,239
the privilege of knowing him so here in

3040
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:14,439
delible Mark so then I start I started

3041
02:51:12,239 --> 02:51:19,600
thinking what is the indelible Mark that

3042
02:51:14,439 --> 02:51:21,479
he left on me and um I can tell you my

3043
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:26,080
little story here

3044
02:51:21,479 --> 02:51:30,120
so when I uh first met him it was 2002

3045
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:32,560
and I was at Berkeley as a postto and um

3046
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:34,920
I met him together with Bruno

3047
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:37,600
Copo he's here he was a pitch the

3048
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:40,880
student and Shankar SRI told us there is

3049
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:43,640
this professor who's visiting from MIT

3050
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:47,080
you should uh go for coffee entertain

3051
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:49,120
him okay let's uh do that so Bruno we

3052
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:52,080
have to uh entertain this Professor from

3053
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:54,720
MIT we should definitely try to make an

3054
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:58,600
impression and uh let's go and so we go

3055
02:51:54,720 --> 02:52:01,520
for coffee and jooy camps uh uh see we

3056
02:51:58,600 --> 02:52:04,560
sit down and it was like almost a comic

3057
02:52:01,520 --> 02:52:07,200
meeting uh you know the two of us and

3058
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:11,399
sanjoy the center we started you know

3059
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:13,399
trying to say uh sanjoy we we worked on

3060
02:52:11,399 --> 02:52:14,800
this cman filtering problem that I think

3061
02:52:13,399 --> 02:52:16,960
is very interesting and we try to

3062
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:19,120
impress him and you know sanjo is not

3063
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:21,600
going to be impressed not going to be

3064
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:24,600
impressive stops right away and says oh

3065
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:27,680
you should look at uh uh you know the

3066
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:29,319
the work that I did with Nigel Newton uh

3067
02:52:27,680 --> 02:52:31,560
and and then we say oh that's very

3068
02:52:29,319 --> 02:52:33,600
interesting and and then we continue

3069
02:52:31,560 --> 02:52:35,520
yeah but but our result here say

3070
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:37,080
something interesting and it stops oh

3071
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:39,840
there is this other reference that you

3072
02:52:37,080 --> 02:52:43,520
should look at and and so on and so on

3073
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:45,800
just you know throwing references at us

3074
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:49,200
one more obscure than the than the other

3075
02:52:45,800 --> 02:52:53,120
of course so so it was not impressed and

3076
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:55,080
then late later I I realized you know

3077
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:57,840
why this was very impactful is because

3078
02:52:55,080 --> 02:53:02,479
you know the the role of the

3079
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:06,359
advisor I think that uh uh he showed me

3080
02:53:02,479 --> 02:53:08,239
that the role of the advisor is not to

3081
02:53:06,359 --> 02:53:10,359
first of all not to be impressed not to

3082
02:53:08,239 --> 02:53:12,160
tell you how great you are doing not to

3083
02:53:10,359 --> 02:53:13,720
tell you exactly what to do like give

3084
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:17,279
you task and you should do this and that

3085
02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:19,000
but just to help so so the his role was

3086
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:22,439
to help he was helping

3087
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:24,840
helping by providing information and uh

3088
02:53:22,439 --> 02:53:28,600
and stimulate your own curiosity and you

3089
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:31,080
know think out out of the box and U and

3090
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:34,239
this is really and not to be concerned

3091
02:53:31,080 --> 02:53:36,080
about impressing people but uh satisfy

3092
02:53:34,239 --> 02:53:37,800
your curiosity and and put your own

3093
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:39,840
goals and this is is very much related

3094
02:53:37,800 --> 02:53:42,120
to what John was saying about you know

3095
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:44,000
stoic philosophy it ties very well to to

3096
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:48,040
the principles of

3097
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:50,120
that um nevertheless uh you know somehow

3098
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:52,760
you know these two strange Italian

3099
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:56,720
fellows were were interesting enough

3100
02:53:52,760 --> 02:54:01,000
that we kept in touch um um through the

3101
02:53:56,720 --> 02:54:04,439
years and um and uh and he really became

3102
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:08,560
um a a a light for

3103
02:54:04,439 --> 02:54:13,840
us um so let let me um say something

3104
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:18,720
else here from from um uh from CHP he

3105
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:21,279
says um uh sanj's life reminds us its

3106
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:24,760
core scholarship is not about just facts

3107
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:27,080
theories or discoveries is about people

3108
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:29,040
and uh uh this is I think is very true

3109
02:54:27,080 --> 02:54:31,000
in the sense that what he was doing and

3110
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:34,840
it was also mentioned before you know

3111
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:37,200
the statement that Petro perona made

3112
02:54:34,840 --> 02:54:38,880
that he created this environment right

3113
02:54:37,200 --> 02:54:41,760
where where where where people will

3114
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:44,560
congregate and he was in the center just

3115
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:46,880
facilitating discussions and U and

3116
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:49,479
creating an environment where people

3117
02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:51,520
could uh Exchange ideas and I think

3118
02:54:49,479 --> 02:54:54,520
that's that's very important part of

3119
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:56,680
what he did um even I remember at

3120
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:58,399
workshops you know sometimes happens

3121
02:54:56,680 --> 02:55:02,040
often at conference and workshop

3122
02:54:58,399 --> 02:55:04,359
somebody gives a talk and then you know

3123
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:06,680
there is no interaction just you know no

3124
02:55:04,359 --> 02:55:08,840
no questions and so on so if he was in

3125
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:12,359
the audience he would rather than ask

3126
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:15,040
questions sometimes know identify

3127
02:55:12,359 --> 02:55:17,000
somebody and say Ali you have something

3128
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:20,640
to to comment about this or something

3129
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:22,359
like that so so so that was uh uh quite

3130
02:55:20,640 --> 02:55:24,479
unique

3131
02:55:22,359 --> 02:55:28,200
um

3132
02:55:24,479 --> 02:55:31,760
um okay then the LA the last thing is um

3133
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:34,479
well I just skip some of CHA answer here

3134
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:36,680
but it says uh but beyond academic

3135
02:55:34,479 --> 02:55:40,279
accolades and jooy was a man of profound

3136
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:42,760
character he had a quite Elegance about

3137
02:55:40,279 --> 02:55:44,640
him a Grace that defined not only his

3138
02:55:42,760 --> 02:55:48,000
interaction but his entire Outlook of

3139
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:51,120
life and U uh at the end I think that

3140
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:53,800
that's what um it's pecular about this

3141
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:56,920
is that U it's the character of the

3142
02:55:53,800 --> 02:55:59,560
person that really inspired us so he

3143
02:55:56,920 --> 02:56:02,800
created this image in this way of sort

3144
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:06,319
of uh being somehow distant but

3145
02:56:02,800 --> 02:56:09,960
accessible at the same time and uh we as

3146
02:56:06,319 --> 02:56:12,640
disciples really wor worshiped the him

3147
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:15,000
so and I I talked to you know yesterday

3148
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:17,120
over dinner about this you know he would

3149
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:20,800
say these things that uh are very

3150
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:22,680
obscure and then be quiet and then we

3151
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:25,279
spent like days afterwards you know

3152
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:27,600
sanjo said this what what what what what

3153
02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:30,000
did he mean you know I start you know

3154
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:33,200
just trusting him completely 100% and

3155
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:36,680
try to sort of decode what what he meant

3156
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:39,040
and and and and possibly uh go beyond

3157
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:41,880
what he said and discover things uh new

3158
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:44,920
so that that was uh was really part of

3159
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:46,720
of his uh of his character and the

3160
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:49,479
figure that that he

3161
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:51,640
created um and he really inspired us

3162
02:56:49,479 --> 02:56:54,479
through uh I mean he advised us through

3163
02:56:51,640 --> 02:56:55,399
inspiration that's what um Maxim rinsky

3164
02:56:54,479 --> 02:56:58,600
also

3165
02:56:55,399 --> 02:57:01,239
mentioned okay one um one last thing is

3166
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:05,800
U how I like to remember San jooy and I

3167
02:57:01,239 --> 02:57:06,760
tell you another little story um 12

3168
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:10,319
years

3169
02:57:06,760 --> 02:57:12,399
ago he came to uh to my webing he flew

3170
02:57:10,319 --> 02:57:14,439
to San Diego and I was very honored that

3171
02:57:12,399 --> 02:57:16,880
he did that and he he participated in

3172
02:57:14,439 --> 02:57:21,640
the wedding and then he brought uh a

3173
02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:24,239
present to us uh it it was um a pair of

3174
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:27,640
wine glasses champagne glasses that were

3175
02:57:24,239 --> 02:57:32,720
beautiful engraved very nice uh present

3176
02:57:27,640 --> 02:57:35,600
and so nowadays uh every time uh we have

3177
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:37,640
some celebration or something at home we

3178
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:40,840

3179
02:57:37,640 --> 02:57:43,640
of prco my wife would say uh masimo take

3180
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:45,800

him okay this is the end of the session

3184
02:57:57,200 --> 02:58:03,760
I just want to end it on a light note in

3185
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:06,520
echoing uh Maria's and Peter's uh

3186
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:09,600
comments about uh sanj's

3187
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:11,399
practicality um we often found sanjoy uh

3188
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:13,720
talking practical stuff in a classroom

3189
02:58:11,399 --> 02:58:15,359
so one time he said to be practical

3190
02:58:13,720 --> 02:58:19,359
let's consider a measure that is

3191
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:21,640
continuous with respect to leag

3192
02:58:19,359 --> 02:58:23,279
I don't know if that was in his patent

3193
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:25,760
anyway I would like to thank the

3194
02:58:23,279 --> 02:58:27,760

3214
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:35,840
me okay uh so first I like to thank the

3215
02:59:33,880 --> 02:59:39,359
organizers for inviting me I'm very

3216
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:41,800
happy to be here at first um I wasn't

3217
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:44,439
sure if I wanted to speak because I you

3218
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:46,880
know at the lid's 80th anniversary I'd

3219
02:59:44,439 --> 02:59:48,680
introduced sanjoy and I was quite happy

3220
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:50,520
with how that went and I thought maybe I

3221
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:52,439
would leave it at that but this is a

3222
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:54,920
memorial conference and I do have quite

3223
02:59:52,439 --> 02:59:57,160
a lot of memories and uh at least some

3224
02:59:54,920 --> 03:00:00,840
of them I wanted I thought would be good

3225
02:59:57,160 --> 03:00:05,200
to share so Vivic already mentioned um

3226
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:07,200
the trip into Pisa and I remember um

3227
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:10,319
Adriana mentioning that the car had been

3228
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:12,439
left unlocked and and thinking uh that

3229
03:00:10,319 --> 03:00:15,000
she wanted San to go back and and I

3230
03:00:12,439 --> 03:00:17,200
remember thinking at the time you know

3231
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,600
um yeah maybe maybe he should I

3232
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:20,160
suggested maybe you should move the car

3233
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:22,600
but then I kind of regretted it because

3234
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:24,600
I was thinking uh the less driving the

3235
03:00:22,600 --> 03:00:26,640
better and John Paris was right the

3236
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:28,960
drive there was nerve-wracking I

3237
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:31,359
remember it very well but uh you the

3238
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:33,359
trip in that time in Pisa was really

3239
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:36,920
great for me and also ended up having

3240
03:00:33,359 --> 03:00:39,560
important um contributions to my work at

3241
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:41,600
MIT because of the connecting to the

3242
03:00:39,560 --> 03:00:45,200
Georgie who was there and sanj brought a

3243
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:47,640
student of his uh Luigi Ambrosio to MIT

3244
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:50,439
and who taught us all about sbv spaces

3245
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:53,439
and free discontinuity problems and and

3246
03:00:50,439 --> 03:00:55,800
the math uh was very important to the to

3247
03:00:53,439 --> 03:00:59,680
the work that I did

3248
03:00:55,800 --> 03:01:01,840
and um as Alan had mentioned uh Sano did

3249
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:05,520
look after the career of the students

3250
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:07,760
long after so uh yeah just same with

3251
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:10,279
Allan I it came as a total shock to me

3252
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:12,000
somewhere around 2011 I got this letter

3253
03:01:10,279 --> 03:01:14,479
that I I was elected to the National

3254
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,439
Academy of engineering and I I had I

3255
03:01:14,479 --> 03:01:17,920
knew right away that sand was behind it

3256
03:01:16,439 --> 03:01:20,279
it was a little odd because the word

3257
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:23,120
work had no connection really well very

3258
03:01:20,279 --> 03:01:25,479
little direct connection at least to uh

3259
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:27,800
what I had done with sanjoy but maybe a

3260
03:01:25,479 --> 03:01:29,960
year before he had asked me to send him

3261
03:01:27,800 --> 03:01:31,120
some information on some patents at

3262
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:33,800
first I thought he was trying to get me

3263
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:36,080
into a faculty job but uh that didn't

3264
03:01:33,800 --> 03:01:38,319
happen so then I realized that's what it

3265
03:01:36,080 --> 03:01:40,439
was and I so I next time I saw him I

3266
03:01:38,319 --> 03:01:43,880
said you know how did how did you know

3267
03:01:40,439 --> 03:01:48,279
like he said Ana chbby helped me a

3268
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:51,200
little and so they uh so somehow behind

3269
03:01:48,279 --> 03:01:53,359
the scenes you know watching over me uh

3270
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:55,880
kind of like a a fairy Godfather or

3271
03:01:53,359 --> 03:01:58,600
something I I I I was really kind of

3272
03:01:55,880 --> 03:02:01,600
shocked by that experience but what I

3273
03:01:58,600 --> 03:02:04,760
really wanted to share was my Mo most

3274
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:07,920
poignant memory of s joy and maybe it's

3275
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:09,760
a little difficult in a sense to to

3276
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:12,479
explain because it may sound a little

3277
03:02:09,760 --> 03:02:13,960
self- serving because uh I have to

3278
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:15,520
discuss my relationship with sanjoy and

3279
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:18,120
how I experienced him and it was it was

3280
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:23,640
a real experience but it was a little

3281
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:25,239
unusual so I came to MIT in 1986 the

3282
03:02:23,640 --> 03:02:28,279
center for intelligent Control Systems

3283
03:02:25,239 --> 03:02:30,000
had just been started and uh in brown

3284
03:02:28,279 --> 03:02:31,720
there was this group looking at Mark our

3285
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:34,399
random Fields as supplied to computer

3286
03:02:31,720 --> 03:02:38,000
vision sto I just graduated a student

3287
03:02:34,399 --> 03:02:41,359
Jose amican Amin who was um also in the

3288
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:43,040
Cs lab had worked on inverse problems

3289
03:02:41,359 --> 03:02:46,279
and using essentially Marco random

3290
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:49,000
Fields as a prior so San was interested

3291
03:02:46,279 --> 03:02:53,760
in uh Pur showing these kinds of ideas

3292
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:56,399
and Mark a random Fields I remember um

3293
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:58,200
going to meetings with him and I the

3294
03:02:56,399 --> 03:03:01,160
means were very exciting and very

3295
03:02:58,200 --> 03:03:04,160
inspiring and often I would leave the

3296
03:03:01,160 --> 03:03:05,920
office like said some great thing is

3297
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:08,800
coming I can't believe you know the

3298
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:11,359
vision that I just experienced and then

3299
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:13,120
I would go back to my office and sit and

3300
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:14,399
think about it and work on then think we

3301
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:17,120
just kind of

3302
03:03:14,399 --> 03:03:18,439
dissolve I it was very hard to find an

3303
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:20,880
actual

3304
03:03:18,439 --> 03:03:23,840
um it's

3305
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:26,239
actionable um step to take from this

3306
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:28,760
inspiration but it was it was generally

3307
03:03:26,239 --> 03:03:31,479
real and and very enjoyable and and it

3308
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:35,200
lasted for years I and I still had them

3309
03:03:31,479 --> 03:03:37,479
um years later but uh just give you an

3310
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:39,319
example um so actually there's a quote

3311
03:03:37,479 --> 03:03:41,600
from Einstein something along the lines

3312
03:03:39,319 --> 03:03:44,319
students are not a container to fill but

3313
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:45,920
a torch to be set a light and sanjo is

3314
03:03:44,319 --> 03:03:49,439
very good at setting a light but he's

3315
03:03:45,920 --> 03:03:51,880
also filling the container um so I

3316
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:53,439
remember like very early on uh he told

3317
03:03:51,880 --> 03:03:55,560
me you know Kenneth Wilson's giving you

3318
03:03:53,439 --> 03:03:57,479
a talk so he had just won the Nobel

3319
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:59,439
Prize two years earlier for

3320
03:03:57,479 --> 03:04:02,200
renormalization group so renormalization

3321
03:03:59,439 --> 03:04:05,040
group clearly should be connected to

3322
03:04:02,200 --> 03:04:07,800
computer vision right so I went to the

3323
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:11,319
talk and I didn't understand anything

3324
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:13,279
thing and came back to talk to sanjoy

3325
03:04:11,319 --> 03:04:14,800
and uh said well I should read this read

3326
03:04:13,279 --> 03:04:16,640
this read this so I read all these

3327
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:18,359
papers I finally started to learn get

3328
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:21,160
some idea what it was all about it was a

3329
03:04:18,359 --> 03:04:24,000
very delicate object mathematically

3330
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:26,560
quite difficult there were a lot of um

3331
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:28,640
problems with doing the renormalization

3332
03:04:26,560 --> 03:04:30,200
and so on and it was basically something

3333
03:04:28,640 --> 03:04:32,640
that could be applied to a very special

3334
03:04:30,200 --> 03:04:34,840
case in statistical mechanics so yeah

3335
03:04:32,640 --> 03:04:37,239
very interesting great great stuff but

3336
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:39,880
what do I do with it and then there was

3337
03:04:37,239 --> 03:04:42,920
another experience like that uh shortly

3338
03:04:39,880 --> 03:04:45,040
after I was learning you have to go read

3339
03:04:42,920 --> 03:04:47,160
Bran's papers or Mark of random Fields

3340
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:48,200
what are the conditions for Unique gives

3341
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:49,960
measures

3342
03:04:48,200 --> 03:04:52,200
difficult stuff and uh I worked quite

3343
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:54,359
hard and but the thing was I wasn't

3344
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:57,160
getting anywhere I wasn't producing any

3345
03:04:54,359 --> 03:05:00,120
of these great synthesis results that I

3346
03:04:57,160 --> 03:05:03,279
think the let's say the um Global

3347
03:05:00,120 --> 03:05:05,439
viewpoints that SRE was after and so I

3348
03:05:03,279 --> 03:05:07,640
was starting to feel frustrated and a

3349
03:05:05,439 --> 03:05:08,720
little defeated this went on for maybe

3350
03:05:07,640 --> 03:05:11,520
two

3351
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:13,359
years and I was starting to think that I

3352
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:16,120
just didn't have what it takes I mean he

3353
03:05:13,359 --> 03:05:18,120
was sharing these Visions but I somehow

3354
03:05:16,120 --> 03:05:19,840
was not able to fulfill them I think the

3355
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:23,000
connections are are there and many of

3356
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:27,359
them I think will play out if not

3357
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:29,680
already but um eventually

3358
03:05:27,359 --> 03:05:31,160
but okay but but I wasn't I I was

3359
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:33,200
starting to think that I just didn't

3360
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:35,000
have what it takes I couldn't I couldn't

3361
03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:37,319
realize the vision and I was starting to

3362
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:41,640
think that maybe

3363
03:05:37,319 --> 03:05:43,279
um I wasn't going to make it now

3364
03:05:41,640 --> 03:05:45,600
sanjoy

3365
03:05:43,279 --> 03:05:48,279
um like I said

3366
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:49,600
he I was under the impression that he

3367
03:05:48,279 --> 03:05:51,800
would have these make these connections

3368
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:53,760
between things and he could see what was

3369
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:56,520
coming from them and it was my job

3370
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:58,800
basically to realize that vision and it

3371
03:05:56,520 --> 03:06:02,359
was in some sense that's right but

3372
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:03,920
wasn't exactly right and uh so my most

3373
03:06:02,359 --> 03:06:06,200
poignant memory is when I realize what

3374
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:08,560
was actually going on there and it

3375
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:11,000
happened like I said after about two

3376
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:12,840
years and I was actually thinking that I

3377
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,479
I maybe I should give this up because I

3378
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:16,640
just wasn't producing any results I

3379
03:06:14,479 --> 03:06:18,640
didn't have anything to show for the

3380
03:06:16,640 --> 03:06:21,520
efforts which had been kind of

3381
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:22,800
extreme so I had a meeting with sanjoy

3382
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:26,120
and

3383
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:28,479
he and he and I was in the state of

3384
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:30,760
almost delirium because I thought um I

3385
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:33,080
should just this is gonna this has got

3386
03:06:30,760 --> 03:06:35,120
to end and and San was talking about

3387
03:06:33,080 --> 03:06:37,439
random fields on the board and he was

3388
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:40,640
saying something about you know maybe we

3389
03:06:37,439 --> 03:06:42,399
can treat this as a signal noise ratio

3390
03:06:40,640 --> 03:06:45,040
and I looked at it and I thought and in

3391
03:06:42,399 --> 03:06:46,920
my delirium I was

3392
03:06:45,040 --> 03:06:48,640
thinking there's something wrong with

3393
03:06:46,920 --> 03:06:51,160
that there's something wrong with the

3394
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:53,200
units and up to this point you know my

3395
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:54,760
discussions with Shan Joy were mostly he

3396
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:58,840
would say something explain something

3397
03:06:54,760 --> 03:07:02,439
and I would try to understand now um I

3398
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:03,880
had nothing left to lose and he and I

3399
03:07:02,439 --> 03:07:06,800
looked at you know thought about what he

3400
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:07,920
said um and realized that okay there was

3401
03:07:06,800 --> 03:07:09,920
something wrong with the units maybe

3402
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:13,920
there's a way to fix it came up with

3403
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:15,840
something and then said to him well you

3404
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:19,040
know maybe maybe we should defin it this

3405
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:21,600
way and he turned to me me and said

3406
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:24,560
maybe you're right and that completely

3407
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:26,479
changed everything so in that moment I I

3408
03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:28,720
had a there was a huge shock to my

3409
03:07:26,479 --> 03:07:30,479
system that all along sanoy had been

3410
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:33,160
putting these ideas out there it was

3411
03:07:30,479 --> 03:07:35,600
meant to as a guide here's interesting

3412
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:37,720
Territory go explore but as far as

3413
03:07:35,600 --> 03:07:40,239
deciding what to do or finding the path

3414
03:07:37,720 --> 03:07:43,760
to actual work and results that was up

3415
03:07:40,239 --> 03:07:47,000
to me to do and and

3416
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:49,840
so that completely sort of inverted my

3417
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:52,520
world that point and but from there on I

3418
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:55,000
was able to I was able to take sanj's

3419
03:07:52,520 --> 03:07:57,239
advice in a different way now after that

3420
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:59,920
point I was able to take suggestions and

3421
03:07:57,239 --> 03:08:01,439
his pointers think about them you know

3422
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:04,160
and as far as actually getting things

3423
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:05,840
done reject them if necessary and the

3424
03:08:04,160 --> 03:08:07,880
amazing thing was that you know that

3425
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:10,080
never seemed to bother sanjy that

3426
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:11,760
whatever I decide to do and whatever I

3427
03:08:10,080 --> 03:08:15,279
could think of doing which was always up

3428
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:17,600
to me U was okay and so I managed to

3429
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:23,000
muddle through and finish the thesis

3430
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:27,120
this and carry on and so this um idea of

3431
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:29,359
the global Viewpoint to me what I think

3432
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:31,600
remains with San sanoy with me the most

3433
03:08:29,359 --> 03:08:34,080
is this idea which I think I experienced

3434
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:35,880
in those first two years of his trying

3435
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:38,279
to point out you know what were the

3436
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:41,520
possibilities for some Global synthesis

3437
03:08:38,279 --> 03:08:44,800
some great perspective uh some something

3438
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:47,160
really achieving uh in terms of bringing

3439
03:08:44,800 --> 03:08:49,880
the best ideas together and seeing

3440
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:53,279
something new and deep and to me that's

3441
03:08:49,880 --> 03:08:54,840
what's going to stick from San Joy it

3442
03:08:53,279 --> 03:08:56,920
sounds it's kind of something worth

3443
03:08:54,840 --> 03:09:00,279
living for I think it's a good worthwh

3444
03:08:56,920 --> 03:09:04,040
life mission and that's what San left me

3445
03:09:00,279 --> 03:09:05,110
with I'm I feel much better for it thank

3446
03:09:04,040 --> 03:09:12,540
you

3447
03:09:05,110 --> 03:09:12,540
[Applause]

3448
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:25,040
uh I also want to thank the organizers

3449
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:29,000
for putting this together um just a a

3450
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:32,479
great way to to remember sanjoy um it's

3451
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:36,120
been emotional already for me and um uh

3452
03:09:32,479 --> 03:09:39,319
just just really really great um I just

3453
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:41,439
wanted to first uh comment on sojo's

3454
03:09:39,319 --> 03:09:43,960
sorial splendoress like no one has

3455
03:09:41,439 --> 03:09:45,680
really commented on this right whenever

3456
03:09:43,960 --> 03:09:48,000
I used to go to his office he had his

3457
03:09:45,680 --> 03:09:51,439
three-piece suit on he was um you know

3458
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:54,120
on his game um it's really awesome and

3459
03:09:51,439 --> 03:09:56,279
um uh in fact yesterday morning when I

3460
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:58,000
was packing to come here uh I was

3461
03:09:56,279 --> 03:09:59,880
looking in my closet and I decided let

3462
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:02,960
me go ahead and go with the white linen

3463
03:09:59,880 --> 03:10:05,080
jacket right um so one of the things sjo

3464
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:07,279
really gave me was kind of a an

3465
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:10,760
emotional education kind of confidence

3466
03:10:07,279 --> 03:10:13,399
to to do and to be um and that's

3467
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:15,680
something I think is um perhaps unusual

3468
03:10:13,399 --> 03:10:17,319
um I think a lot of advisers you know

3469
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:20,640
they focus on on technical train

3470
03:10:17,319 --> 03:10:22,760
training they focus on um um you know I

3471
03:10:20,640 --> 03:10:24,880
mean a variety of things but uh kind of

3472
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:26,640
that emotional confidence and and that

3473
03:10:24,880 --> 03:10:31,000
kind of education I think is something

3474
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:33,760
that um uh really um kind of made made

3475
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:36,160
me uh kind of um pursue things that

3476
03:10:33,760 --> 03:10:36,800
might seem a little unusual or out of

3477
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:41,080
the

3478
03:10:36,800 --> 03:10:43,399
mainstream um so um yeah that's kind of

3479
03:10:41,080 --> 03:10:45,439
um like one of the the core core

3480
03:10:43,399 --> 03:10:46,800
attributes I think of of Sunjoy advising

3481
03:10:45,439 --> 03:10:47,760
that many people have have kind of

3482
03:10:46,800 --> 03:10:50,680
brought up

3483
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:53,359
is um this confidence to explore um and

3484
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:57,000
and to kind of try to bring these pieces

3485
03:10:53,359 --> 03:11:00,120
together um just like maso um sanjo came

3486
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,960
to our wedding uh in in Florida in 201

3487
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:04,040
end of

3488
03:11:00,960 --> 03:11:06,040
2013 uh just before Christmas and uh he

3489
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:07,760
actually he gave us glasses as well uh

3490
03:11:06,040 --> 03:11:12,359
maybe that's his thing for wedding gifts

3491
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:14,040
I'm not quite sure um um but uh yeah he

3492
03:11:12,359 --> 03:11:17,399
was on the dance floor as well which

3493
03:11:14,040 --> 03:11:19,800
which was kind of fun and um uh the the

3494
03:11:17,399 --> 03:11:21,640
I wanted to mention was um the dessert

3495
03:11:19,800 --> 03:11:23,720
that we served at our wedding reception

3496
03:11:21,640 --> 03:11:26,000
was something that was designed by by a

3497
03:11:23,720 --> 03:11:28,439
technology that I had developed at IBM

3498
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:32,920
this Chef Watson technology um it was a

3499
03:11:28,439 --> 03:11:36,840
caymanian plantain dessert it had uh

3500
03:11:32,920 --> 03:11:40,520
Cayman um pepper uh kind of a banana

3501
03:11:36,840 --> 03:11:42,319
cream L and so on and um I mean it was

3502
03:11:40,520 --> 03:11:44,080
it was a solid dessert but he was

3503
03:11:42,319 --> 03:11:45,920
actually very effusive like like more

3504
03:11:44,080 --> 03:11:47,880
than he should have been it was again

3505
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:49,439
kind of a nice way to to give me

3506
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:51,520
confidence and I was going to be

3507
03:11:49,439 --> 03:11:53,760
starting as a professor the following

3508
03:11:51,520 --> 03:11:55,200
week after the wedding so we went on our

3509
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:57,359
honeymoon then I moved to Illinois and

3510
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:58,960
then then started so um again it was

3511
03:11:57,359 --> 03:12:01,560
kind of this kind of bringing um

3512
03:11:58,960 --> 03:12:04,200
bringing kind of some confidence um that

3513
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:07,920
uh you know um you can you can be who

3514
03:12:04,200 --> 03:12:09,760
you are um and um when I was a student

3515
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:12,960
perhaps I wasn't the the strongest

3516
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:15,640
mathematically um but um again he often

3517
03:12:12,960 --> 03:12:18,399
would say that um you know you can be

3518
03:12:15,640 --> 03:12:19,800
who you are um you're an engineer um

3519
03:12:18,399 --> 03:12:22,040
kind of solve the problem that's in

3520
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:24,160
front of you and uh and it's okay if you

3521
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:26,120
don't use the uh the fanciest

3522
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:29,160
mathematical techniques but if you can

3523
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:33,520
make an impact um conceptually or or

3524
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:35,560
kind of in a um uh kind of in a in a

3525
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:39,359
societal impact manner I mean that's

3526
03:12:35,560 --> 03:12:42,560
that's appropriate as well so um so that

3527
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:46,120
was kind of um some of my experiences as

3528
03:12:42,560 --> 03:12:48,760
a as a student and and later on um I

3529
03:12:46,120 --> 03:12:50,399
came um to Cambridge once uh with my

3530
03:12:48,760 --> 03:12:53,120
2-year-old daughter and you know we we

3531
03:12:50,399 --> 03:12:56,160
stopped by Sun Joy's office um she Drew

3532
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:58,439
on his board uh with his chalk which

3533
03:12:56,160 --> 03:13:00,600
which I don't know like he had very

3534
03:12:58,439 --> 03:13:02,920
thick chalk I'm not sure why he had such

3535
03:13:00,600 --> 03:13:05,279
thick chalk so she had very kind of

3536
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:07,720
difficulty holding it so then um he gave

3537
03:13:05,279 --> 03:13:10,319
her a a piece of paper and a pen so she

3538
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:13,479
Drew on that and we had kind of a nice

3539
03:13:10,319 --> 03:13:15,720
chitchat and um like as when when I was

3540
03:13:13,479 --> 03:13:17,920
a student of course um but also um at

3541
03:13:15,720 --> 03:13:19,760
that time he had you know a lot of books

3542
03:13:17,920 --> 03:13:22,439
on his on his table his Round Table in

3543
03:13:19,760 --> 03:13:25,120
his office and one of the books that he

3544
03:13:22,439 --> 03:13:28,160
had on his uh office desk at the time

3545
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:31,239
was uh grenander General pattern Theory

3546
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:34,520
Book which many of you have may be

3547
03:13:31,239 --> 03:13:36,920
familiar with um and we kind of had this

3548
03:13:34,520 --> 03:13:38,960
conversation that um you know no one's

3549
03:13:36,920 --> 03:13:41,640
really pursued that direction uh to its

3550
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:44,399
fullest this pattern Theory idea and it

3551
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:46,200
kind of struck me and um in the last

3552
03:13:44,399 --> 03:13:47,880
several years I've been pursuing this

3553
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:49,439
direction that we call information Lotus

3554
03:13:47,880 --> 03:13:51,200
learning which kind of takes group

3555
03:13:49,439 --> 03:13:53,640
theoretic ideas and information

3556
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:56,040
theoretic ideas to learn and discover

3557
03:13:53,640 --> 03:13:58,479
knowledge and um in many ways I think

3558
03:13:56,040 --> 03:14:01,000
that grenander influence I mean VI

3559
03:13:58,479 --> 03:14:04,319
sanjoy was uh has been kind of driving

3560
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:06,319
that and um and really kind of also sjo

3561
03:14:04,319 --> 03:14:08,120
kind of humanism in in a sense so music

3562
03:14:06,319 --> 03:14:10,000
theory has been our first application

3563
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:12,399
area I'm trying to learn the laws of

3564
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:15,720
Music Theory from just a small amount of

3565
03:14:12,399 --> 03:14:20,160
data um data just 300 CS from by Johan

3566
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:22,680
Sebastian Bach um so um so again kind of

3567
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:25,120
just uh just you know that visit uh to

3568
03:14:22,680 --> 03:14:27,399
MIT with my daughter U I mean it was

3569
03:14:25,120 --> 03:14:29,200
more just kind of a social visit but he

3570
03:14:27,399 --> 03:14:31,040
said you know read read revisit

3571
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:35,479
grenander and then it kind of inspired

3572
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:38,880
this uh this line of work um another

3573
03:14:35,479 --> 03:14:40,399
kind of interesting visit was uh

3574
03:14:38,880 --> 03:14:41,800
actually I mean an kind of encouraged me

3575
03:14:40,399 --> 03:14:44,640
to also talk a little bit about his

3576
03:14:41,800 --> 03:14:46,479
modern influences so or impacts so let

3577
03:14:44,640 --> 03:14:49,960
me just actually do a brief aside on

3578
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:52,080
that um so um I think early on today

3579
03:14:49,960 --> 03:14:55,479
someone was mentioning his 1968 paper on

3580
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:56,800
modal control um and it uh it's

3581
03:14:55,479 --> 03:14:59,439
something that I've been working on

3582
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:01,200
myself actually recently um so I've been

3583
03:14:59,439 --> 03:15:03,880
collaborating with the with a

3584
03:15:01,200 --> 03:15:07,479
neuroscientist eron barbet and he does a

3585
03:15:03,880 --> 03:15:09,800
lot of um fmri studies on human

3586
03:15:07,479 --> 03:15:11,000
intelligence so he does studies on a

3587
03:15:09,800 --> 03:15:12,920
large number of people and there's

3588
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:15,120
behavioral measurements on how they

3589
03:15:12,920 --> 03:15:17,080
score on intelligence tests and so on um

3590
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:19,120
but then fmri studies on looking at

3591
03:15:17,080 --> 03:15:20,760
nature of their brain and and the basic

3592
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:24,479
question is are there neural correlates

3593
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:27,840
of intelligence um and uh and it turns

3594
03:15:24,479 --> 03:15:30,479
out that um in fact yes uh so modal

3595
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:32,960
control ability um provides a mechanism

3596
03:15:30,479 --> 03:15:35,840
to measure uh individual differences in

3597
03:15:32,960 --> 03:15:37,880
in human intelligence uh in particular

3598
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:39,880
um kind of the flexibility in driving

3599
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:42,560
kind of Global Network architectures to

3600
03:15:39,880 --> 03:15:44,560
to disperate States um seems to be U

3601
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:48,319
very strongly correlated with uh with

3602
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:50,359
human intelligence so um uh yeah when we

3603
03:15:48,319 --> 03:15:52,199
were doing this work in fact I didn't

3604
03:15:50,359 --> 03:15:54,040
realize it was sanjo who developed modal

3605
03:15:52,199 --> 03:15:56,239
control uh when I was first working on

3606
03:15:54,040 --> 03:15:58,080
this but uh and we looked back and saw

3607
03:15:56,239 --> 03:16:01,080
you know it was that 1968 paper where it

3608
03:15:58,080 --> 03:16:02,160
came from um and more recently we've

3609
03:16:01,080 --> 03:16:05,279
been looking at some kind of

3610
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:07,920
Neuroscience questions um with mitovski

3611
03:16:05,279 --> 03:16:09,920
at the flat iron Institute in New York

3612
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:12,840
um and and the kind of emerging view is

3613
03:16:09,920 --> 03:16:14,600
that at an anatomical level um seems

3614
03:16:12,840 --> 03:16:16,800
like there's maybe data driven control

3615
03:16:14,600 --> 03:16:18,279
all the way down to individual neurons

3616
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:20,120
um um there's uh kind of been a

3617
03:16:18,279 --> 03:16:21,920
long-standing view that at a cognitive

3618
03:16:20,120 --> 03:16:24,120
level there's uh kind of control

3619
03:16:21,920 --> 03:16:25,760
theoretic things happening but even at

3620
03:16:24,120 --> 03:16:28,840
the individual neuron level it seems

3621
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:30,680
that maybe there's uh some control and

3622
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:33,840
uh so we've been drawing a little bit on

3623
03:16:30,680 --> 03:16:36,720
on on seare and and and uh and Sunjoy

3624
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:40,000
work on communication restricted control

3625
03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:42,720
so um so kind of all these ideas that uh

3626
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:45,279
kind of that I was exposed to kind of in

3627
03:16:42,720 --> 03:16:47,920
the in the millu of of sj's work and and

3628
03:16:45,279 --> 03:16:49,920
of Lids more broadly seem to be seem to

3629
03:16:47,920 --> 03:16:52,359
be coming back and these questions

3630
03:16:49,920 --> 03:16:55,640
around Neuroscience likewise the the

3631
03:16:52,359 --> 03:16:57,399
Charles Rockland seans report uh again

3632
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:59,720
we've been thinking about that more and

3633
03:16:57,399 --> 03:17:02,040
more uh to think about how um

3634
03:16:59,720 --> 03:17:04,160
segregation and integration are kind of

3635
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:06,840
key to uh to human

3636
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:09,479
intelligence um or or also even at the

3637
03:17:06,840 --> 03:17:10,720
level of nematodes like seans and and

3638
03:17:09,479 --> 03:17:14,239
other small

3639
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:17,600
organisms um so I think I fulfilled my

3640
03:17:14,239 --> 03:17:20,319
my duty to talk about modern impacts

3641
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:21,960
um uh and then I wanted to briefly speak

3642
03:17:20,319 --> 03:17:25,600
about the last time I met sanjoy this

3643
03:17:21,960 --> 03:17:27,640
was Memorial Day Weekend uh in 23 uh

3644
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:30,880
just a month before his before his

3645
03:17:27,640 --> 03:17:33,000
passing um so I um at the time I was on

3646
03:17:30,880 --> 03:17:36,640
leave uh to serve at the white house uh

3647
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:39,880
so I was a bureaucrat for a year um and

3648
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:42,439
sanjo I was actually um not displeased

3649
03:17:39,880 --> 03:17:44,359
about it uh so he was actually quite

3650
03:17:42,439 --> 03:17:47,960
like he was supportive of you know these

3651
03:17:44,359 --> 03:17:49,840
deviations in in in my life's journey um

3652
03:17:47,960 --> 03:17:52,239
and uh a couple of the things that we

3653
03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:55,560
talked about were were quite interesting

3654
03:17:52,239 --> 03:17:58,760
so um uh there's this uh there's this

3655
03:17:55,560 --> 03:18:01,359
religious text the uh the um

3656
03:17:58,760 --> 03:18:04,319
Chand um and there's a a section in

3657
03:18:01,359 --> 03:18:06,080
there which talks about um kind of the

3658
03:18:04,319 --> 03:18:08,359
knowledge that's available to Kings

3659
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:12,279
versus the knowledge that's available to

3660
03:18:08,359 --> 03:18:14,720
to Scholars um essentially um and uh I

3661
03:18:12,279 --> 03:18:16,439
mean the central point is that uh you

3662
03:18:14,720 --> 03:18:18,720
know the practice of doing things like

3663
03:18:16,439 --> 03:18:20,359
govern um leads to different sources of

3664
03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:23,120
knowledge than than just kind of

3665
03:18:20,359 --> 03:18:24,920
theorizing about it um and so he was

3666
03:18:23,120 --> 03:18:26,640
kind of bringing that up a little bit

3667
03:18:24,920 --> 03:18:28,199
that you know you should take your year

3668
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:29,840
uh in the National Security Council and

3669
03:18:28,199 --> 03:18:31,399
you know um gain that practical

3670
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:33,800
experience so then you can think about

3671
03:18:31,399 --> 03:18:37,359
it uh in in some more deeper ways um

3672
03:18:33,800 --> 03:18:39,680
when you go back to being a scholar um

3673
03:18:37,359 --> 03:18:42,080
and um he also brought up uh his his

3674
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:44,319
childhood friend Amaria son's uh kind of

3675
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:48,560
multi-dimensional view of uh of social

3676
03:18:44,319 --> 03:18:50,960
welfare um that uh um I mean the the

3677
03:18:48,560 --> 03:18:52,760
prevailing view in uh in in the

3678
03:18:50,960 --> 03:18:55,640
Eisenhower executive office building is

3679
03:18:52,760 --> 03:18:58,239
of Cl Switz um kind of these distinct

3680
03:18:55,640 --> 03:19:00,560
levers of power um as as kind of how you

3681
03:18:58,239 --> 03:19:03,520
think about uh National um

3682
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:06,760
competitiveness and National Power um

3683
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:08,239
but uh you know sanjoy was was kind of

3684
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:11,520
helping me think through a little bit

3685
03:19:08,239 --> 03:19:13,680
that um this kind of older view like

3686
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:15,880
cilia the the prime minister of jandra

3687
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:18,840
gup Moria he had put forth more of a

3688
03:19:15,880 --> 03:19:21,239
networked View of of National Power um

3689
03:19:18,840 --> 03:19:23,399
so yeah kind of we we discussed that as

3690
03:19:21,239 --> 03:19:25,399
well and um you know just kind of just

3691
03:19:23,399 --> 03:19:27,040
to give you an example everyone has

3692
03:19:25,399 --> 03:19:29,960
talked about this um you know kind of

3693
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:32,439
Sunjoy wide ranging interests but uh it

3694
03:19:29,960 --> 03:19:36,359
kind of brought it home for me um uh

3695
03:19:32,439 --> 03:19:38,080
that day uh just uh just last year um

3696
03:19:36,359 --> 03:19:41,399
and I've been kind of reflecting on this

3697
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:45,000
a little bit more um uh with respect to

3698
03:19:41,399 --> 03:19:48,040
public policy and um engineering Theory

3699
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:50,319
seems fairly absent from most public

3700
03:19:48,040 --> 03:19:52,600
policymaking um so you know there aren't

3701
03:19:50,319 --> 03:19:57,479
so many information theorists uh serving

3702
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:59,199
in government let's say um but uh in in

3703
03:19:57,479 --> 03:20:01,359
kind of some of my Reflections uh

3704
03:19:59,199 --> 03:20:04,399
especially coming back to Illinois after

3705
03:20:01,359 --> 03:20:06,319
after serving um is that in fact

3706
03:20:04,399 --> 03:20:08,160
engineering Theory and some of the ideas

3707
03:20:06,319 --> 03:20:11,560
that come from it can be really powerful

3708
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:13,640
for public policym um sjo used to always

3709
03:20:11,560 --> 03:20:15,680
emphasize to me that Shannon's greatest

3710
03:20:13,640 --> 03:20:17,319
contribution was the separation theorem

3711
03:20:15,680 --> 03:20:19,640
and the architectural

3712
03:20:17,319 --> 03:20:22,120
aspect of separating Source coding from

3713
03:20:19,640 --> 03:20:23,680
Channel coding um not just I mean he

3714
03:20:22,120 --> 03:20:25,399
also liked the universal interface of

3715
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:27,680
bits which he I mean he also likes to

3716
03:20:25,399 --> 03:20:29,399
talk about but um the architectural

3717
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:32,399
principle that you can have these

3718
03:20:29,399 --> 03:20:34,279
different blocks um and as we're

3719
03:20:32,399 --> 03:20:37,319
thinking about for example technology

3720
03:20:34,279 --> 03:20:38,960
policy um or other branches of of public

3721
03:20:37,319 --> 03:20:40,120
policy and these architectural

3722
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:43,279
principles that might come out of

3723
03:20:40,120 --> 03:20:45,800
optimality theories um can actually be

3724
03:20:43,279 --> 03:20:48,040
informative for for public policym is

3725
03:20:45,800 --> 03:20:52,800
something that I don't think many people

3726
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:56,399
think about um but yet um seems to be um

3727
03:20:52,800 --> 03:20:58,920
uh a compelling approach so um yeah just

3728
03:20:56,399 --> 03:21:00,920
kind of um random thoughts uh apologies

3729
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:05,520
for rambling I didn't prepare a very

3730
03:21:00,920 --> 03:21:08,359
cohesive uh thing but um very much

3731
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:11,040
sojo's kind of emotional education has

3732
03:21:08,359 --> 03:21:14,760
been you know very important to me um as

3733
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:17,399
well as his kind of um push to expose

3734
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:19,439
myself to different ways of thought to

3735
03:21:17,399 --> 03:21:21,199
walking around in in some ways both

3736
03:21:19,439 --> 03:21:25,279
physically and and metaphysically I

3737
03:21:21,199 --> 03:21:26,800
suppose um and uh yeah I mean I think

3738
03:21:25,279 --> 03:21:29,160
like many of his students feel the same

3739
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:33,840
way so um let me just stop there and and

3740
03:21:29,160 --> 03:21:35,760
really um say you know uh it's it was

3741
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:38,279
it's been a great journey and um you

3742
03:21:35,760 --> 03:21:42,880
know he'll always be in in my head uh as

3743
03:21:38,279 --> 03:21:42,880
we go forward thank you

3744
03:21:49,199 --> 03:21:51,399
okay

3745
03:21:51,479 --> 03:21:57,000
so a lot has been said about San joy and

3746
03:21:54,560 --> 03:22:00,479
from the perspective of his students um

3747
03:21:57,000 --> 03:22:02,239
I realized there's one thing that has

3748
03:22:00,479 --> 03:22:04,720
been brought up but I wanted to sort of

3749
03:22:02,239 --> 03:22:08,359
give my personal take on on this and how

3750
03:22:04,720 --> 03:22:08,359
it helped me develop you

3751
03:22:08,399 --> 03:22:14,439
know in the outside world it seems

3752
03:22:12,120 --> 03:22:17,160
people think of Engineers and people who

3753
03:22:14,439 --> 03:22:20,399
are science oriented as being very

3754
03:22:17,160 --> 03:22:23,040
narrow and I I come to realize that for

3755
03:22:20,399 --> 03:22:26,600
myself my education especially having

3756
03:22:23,040 --> 03:22:27,720
Sandra as an adviser is I think of the

3757
03:22:26,600 --> 03:22:30,560
exact

3758
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:35,000
opposite right because San was like the

3759
03:22:30,560 --> 03:22:37,479
model of what it what a what a scholar

3760
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:39,560
an engineer should should be like to me

3761
03:22:37,479 --> 03:22:42,160
and this

3762
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:43,600
really I remember as a first year grad

3763
03:22:42,160 --> 03:22:47,680
student you know sitting in the office

3764
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:49,199
and building building 35

3765
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:50,319
and you sitting there thinking about

3766
03:22:49,199 --> 03:22:53,080
something you know research oriented

3767
03:22:50,319 --> 03:22:55,720
sanjo would walk by and he'd

3768
03:22:53,080 --> 03:22:57,279
say have you seen what happened what

3769
03:22:55,720 --> 03:23:01,960
this thing in the New York Review of

3770
03:22:57,279 --> 03:23:03,279
Books and I'm like what no am I supposed

3771
03:23:01,960 --> 03:23:05,960
to know what's in the New York Review of

3772
03:23:03,279 --> 03:23:07,439
Books when I came I honestly when I I

3773
03:23:05,960 --> 03:23:08,720
started as a gradu student I didn't even

3774
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:10,720
know there was such a thing as the New

3775
03:23:08,720 --> 03:23:13,920
York Review of Books forget you know

3776
03:23:10,720 --> 03:23:16,120
what's in it you know and at first I I

3777
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:18,040
talked it up as oh this is you know some

3778
03:23:16,120 --> 03:23:19,800
must be something particularly odd or

3779
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:21,680
interesting you know and so I'll just

3780
03:23:19,800 --> 03:23:24,800
like listen and follow on and then soon

3781
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:26,399
I realized that okay and every day I

3782
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:28,279
would actually go to the engineering

3783
03:23:26,399 --> 03:23:29,680
library and like go and see what's in

3784
03:23:28,279 --> 03:23:31,840
the New York Times what's in the Wall

3785
03:23:29,680 --> 03:23:33,680
Street Journal and what was in the New

3786
03:23:31,840 --> 03:23:35,960
York review of book so that when sanjoy

3787
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:39,239
walks by I'll be able to comment

3788
03:23:35,960 --> 03:23:41,319
something you know um it's part of this

3789
03:23:39,239 --> 03:23:44,479
education that love was mentioning about

3790
03:23:41,319 --> 03:23:46,920
you know looking at a person and sort of

3791
03:23:44,479 --> 03:23:48,160
trying to understand okay not you know

3792
03:23:46,920 --> 03:23:49,720
maybe you should know this a little bit

3793
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:52,720
better and be a little bit more engaged

3794
03:23:49,720 --> 03:23:54,399
with all this other stuff and it really

3795
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:56,960
had an influence on me you know during

3796
03:23:54,399 --> 03:23:59,479
grad school one of the things

3797
03:23:56,960 --> 03:24:01,120
that you know at the time I didn't put

3798
03:23:59,479 --> 03:24:02,920
it together but now I can see clearly

3799
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:04,760
with sanj's influence was that maybe I

3800
03:24:02,920 --> 03:24:08,199
should go and actually read some of this

3801
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:10,399
classic literature you know not I wasn't

3802
03:24:08,199 --> 03:24:11,840
going to read it in the German as San

3803
03:24:10,399 --> 03:24:13,680
would have probably preferred but you

3804
03:24:11,840 --> 03:24:17,840
know like let me read it uh you know in

3805
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:17,840
English or translation at least

3806
03:24:18,479 --> 03:24:25,319
and experience of being a student um and

3807
03:24:21,800 --> 03:24:28,120
being exposed to this was in part seeing

3808
03:24:25,319 --> 03:24:31,800
how it really felt that sandre didn't

3809
03:24:28,120 --> 03:24:34,359
have like one way of thinking about art

3810
03:24:31,800 --> 03:24:36,439
politics and a completely different way

3811
03:24:34,359 --> 03:24:38,840
of thinking about you know uh

3812
03:24:36,439 --> 03:24:42,040
differential equations and stochastic

3813
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:44,880
calculus it was one way of thinking it

3814
03:24:42,040 --> 03:24:47,319
just ranged broadly over

3815
03:24:44,880 --> 03:24:49,920
everything and

3816
03:24:47,319 --> 03:24:52,439
ideas and connections were coming from

3817
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:54,040
everywhere and this encouragement was

3818
03:24:52,439 --> 03:24:55,880
already mentioned of you know hey you

3819
03:24:54,040 --> 03:24:58,239
should I think ASU mentioned it you you

3820
03:24:55,880 --> 03:25:00,239
should attend talks I remember this and

3821
03:24:58,239 --> 03:25:02,640
I remember complaining at the beginning

3822
03:25:00,239 --> 03:25:04,880
I said San I attend the Lizz colloquium

3823
03:25:02,640 --> 03:25:08,720
and after five minutes I have no idea

3824
03:25:04,880 --> 03:25:09,920
what is going on um you know why why are

3825
03:25:08,720 --> 03:25:12,319
you telling me I should be attending

3826
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:15,880
these talks and he goes just

3827
03:25:12,319 --> 03:25:18,680
wait you know you'll see and indeed that

3828
03:25:15,880 --> 03:25:21,760
was very very true just sort of seeing

3829
03:25:18,680 --> 03:25:24,880
the different kinds of things and talked

3830
03:25:21,760 --> 03:25:28,960
about and being able to watch how ideas

3831
03:25:24,880 --> 03:25:30,920
get developed over the course of a PhD

3832
03:25:28,960 --> 03:25:32,760
you know just seeing other not even

3833
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:35,600
stuff not stuff you're working on just

3834
03:25:32,760 --> 03:25:39,760
it it just did inform what it meant to

3835
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:42,960
be uh a scholar and I think that focus

3836
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:44,920
of sanjy on kind of developing us as

3837
03:25:42,960 --> 03:25:48,479
Scholars with

3838
03:25:44,920 --> 03:25:50,600
an with intellectual taste that was

3839
03:25:48,479 --> 03:25:55,040
trying to be cultivated as well as

3840
03:25:50,600 --> 03:25:57,120
breath of ideas is something that I know

3841
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:58,960
many people here are our faculty and I

3842
03:25:57,120 --> 03:26:02,040
you know I often find myself reflecting

3843
03:25:58,960 --> 03:26:06,199
on the experience that um the students I

3844
03:26:02,040 --> 03:26:08,040
have and the students in the milu today

3845
03:26:06,199 --> 03:26:10,640
have

3846
03:26:08,040 --> 03:26:16,000
and sometimes feeling

3847
03:26:10,640 --> 03:26:19,120
like I haven't been as good of a mentor

3848
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:22,640
as sanjoy was in terms of providing them

3849
03:26:19,120 --> 03:26:24,720
with the same kind of encouragement to

3850
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:26,520
be

3851
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:30,199
uh

3852
03:26:26,520 --> 03:26:34,279
patient and it's one could argue it's

3853
03:26:30,199 --> 03:26:36,319
harder today than it was then um but

3854
03:26:34,279 --> 03:26:37,680
still just what he modeled was very very

3855
03:26:36,319 --> 03:26:39,800
profoundly

3856
03:26:37,680 --> 03:26:43,239
influential so this is on the sort of

3857
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:46,560
side of you know you know kind of

3858
03:26:43,239 --> 03:26:49,800
General Recollections and and things

3859
03:26:46,560 --> 03:26:53,359
more specifically I want to comment on

3860
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:56,279
sano's I think Tom has mentioned uh this

3861
03:26:53,359 --> 03:26:57,800
already I'm surprised others have not um

3862
03:26:56,279 --> 03:27:00,040
I think Mike branik is the one who

3863
03:26:57,800 --> 03:27:02,600
described it uh in the language I'm

3864
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:04,960
about to use he said that walking into

3865
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:08,160
San Jo's office is like walking into a

3866
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:10,439
special reality Distortion field where

3867
03:27:08,160 --> 03:27:12,279
you walk in and you know there's a

3868
03:27:10,439 --> 03:27:14,479
conversation about something and it's

3869
03:27:12,279 --> 03:27:16,760
like completely clear and makes total

3870
03:27:14,479 --> 03:27:18,199
sense sort of you kind of reaching but

3871
03:27:16,760 --> 03:27:20,279
it's kind of you're following it but

3872
03:27:18,199 --> 03:27:22,399
then as you walk away you know the the

3873
03:27:20,279 --> 03:27:24,640
further you get from his office the more

3874
03:27:22,399 --> 03:27:26,239
it fades you know almost like a dream

3875
03:27:24,640 --> 03:27:30,680
you know

3876
03:27:26,239 --> 03:27:34,199
but in there were ideas and I could see

3877
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:37,399
sometimes ideas that I mean there ideas

3878
03:27:34,199 --> 03:27:40,560
that sanjoy had mentioned in his office

3879
03:27:37,399 --> 03:27:42,600
that a decade later you know while I'm a

3880
03:27:40,560 --> 03:27:44,960
faculty member or even longer you know

3881
03:27:42,600 --> 03:27:47,520
come back wait that was a really good

3882
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:49,840
connection and now I can understand it

3883
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:52,160
and appreciate it but I think as Tom was

3884
03:27:49,840 --> 03:27:54,040
saying it wasn't that Sandy already had

3885
03:27:52,160 --> 03:27:57,399
thought out what was going to happen you

3886
03:27:54,040 --> 03:27:59,120
know 15 years later but that he could

3887
03:27:57,399 --> 03:28:01,640
see the possibilities and he wanted to

3888
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:04,319
encourage us to be open to these

3889
03:28:01,640 --> 03:28:08,359
possibilities and so a part of this um

3890
03:28:04,319 --> 03:28:12,760
for me was actually the area exam uh so

3891
03:28:08,359 --> 03:28:14,680
uh with the uh with Sano I'm very sad

3892
03:28:12,760 --> 03:28:16,160
for any current MIT graduate student

3893
03:28:14,680 --> 03:28:18,479
you're missing out by not having any

3894
03:28:16,160 --> 03:28:20,000
area exam anymore it was a wonderful

3895
03:28:18,479 --> 03:28:23,279
thing

3896
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:25,040
um but uh you know we were given San

3897
03:28:23,279 --> 03:28:28,840
picked out uh part of the committee you

3898
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:31,880
know a few papers uh and picked these

3899
03:28:28,840 --> 03:28:34,359
Classics for me I think it was the uh

3900
03:28:31,880 --> 03:28:36,920
Colman's original paper on common

3901
03:28:34,359 --> 03:28:38,479
filtering um witsen Housen a pair of

3902
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:41,239
papers on the witsen Housen counter

3903
03:28:38,479 --> 03:28:44,120
example and his paper on separation of

3904
03:28:41,239 --> 03:28:46,920
estimation and control and uh the the

3905
03:28:44,120 --> 03:28:50,359
classic paper on Dual control and it was

3906
03:28:46,920 --> 03:28:54,359
go off go think about these things and

3907
03:28:50,359 --> 03:28:59,800
you know it was a very very intense uh

3908
03:28:54,359 --> 03:29:01,520
month of uh thinking about these things

3909
03:28:59,800 --> 03:29:03,840
um

3910
03:29:01,520 --> 03:29:06,520
sanjy later told me he wasn't just

3911
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:08,560
saying here are some cool papers he was

3912
03:29:06,520 --> 03:29:10,399
exposing to certain ideas putting them

3913
03:29:08,560 --> 03:29:12,680
together and think and suggest saying

3914
03:29:10,399 --> 03:29:17,040
you know what I there's more

3915
03:29:12,680 --> 03:29:19,160
here and that was something that sanjoy

3916
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:23,120
uh brought out

3917
03:29:19,160 --> 03:29:25,720
was it was as though in his

3918
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:27,920
mind there were these intellectual

3919
03:29:25,720 --> 03:29:30,279
questions ranging across many many

3920
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:32,399
different fields and these little points

3921
03:29:30,279 --> 03:29:34,120
of this doesn't we don't understand this

3922
03:29:32,399 --> 03:29:36,600
yet this is important to understand we

3923
03:29:34,120 --> 03:29:38,479
don't understand it yet that he would

3924
03:29:36,600 --> 03:29:40,239
keep circling back and connecting you

3925
03:29:38,479 --> 03:29:42,399
two it wasn't just random what he was

3926
03:29:40,239 --> 03:29:43,840
connecting it wasn't just technique

3927
03:29:42,399 --> 03:29:47,239
although he would definitely bring up

3928
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:49,720
technique it was also

3929
03:29:47,239 --> 03:29:51,800
anomalies we don't understand this we

3930
03:29:49,720 --> 03:29:53,560
don't understand this and we don't

3931
03:29:51,800 --> 03:29:56,040
understand this and they feel like these

3932
03:29:53,560 --> 03:29:58,439
are all anomalous in a similar maybe way

3933
03:29:56,040 --> 03:30:01,479
or maybe not

3934
03:29:58,439 --> 03:30:05,279
and so you know that area exam was fun

3935
03:30:01,479 --> 03:30:06,840
you know we was very influential for

3936
03:30:05,279 --> 03:30:10,239
pushing my direction of what I was going

3937
03:30:06,840 --> 03:30:12,160
to think about and and work on but for

3938
03:30:10,239 --> 03:30:15,239
example on the witsen Housen counter

3939
03:30:12,160 --> 03:30:18,399
example stuff I found myself revisiting

3940
03:30:15,239 --> 03:30:21,479
it uh you know a decade later you know

3941
03:30:18,399 --> 03:30:23,040
uh as new and making and the spirit of

3942
03:30:21,479 --> 03:30:25,319
making connections and seeing what

3943
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:26,600
techniques can be brought in connections

3944
03:30:25,319 --> 03:30:28,680
from one thing to another which

3945
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:31,800
eventually let us you know do something

3946
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:34,479
uh and push move the ball forward um you

3947
03:30:31,800 --> 03:30:36,239
know significantly not fully solve but

3948
03:30:34,479 --> 03:30:39,760
you know push the ball

3949
03:30:36,239 --> 03:30:43,239
forward and in that way for me as a

3950
03:30:39,760 --> 03:30:46,560
faculty member and as a researcher San

3951
03:30:43,239 --> 03:30:49,520
Joy's experience being a student has

3952
03:30:46,560 --> 03:30:50,720
continued to influence me uh and well I

3953
03:30:49,520 --> 03:30:53,040
think continue to influence me and

3954
03:30:50,720 --> 03:30:54,479
influence my students indirectly and I

3955
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:56,760
think that's really a very important

3956
03:30:54,479 --> 03:30:58,040
part of sanj's Legacy Beyond any

3957
03:30:56,760 --> 03:31:02,040
specific

3958
03:30:58,040 --> 03:31:03,720
results um that that he had um final

3959
03:31:02,040 --> 03:31:08,720
comment I wanted to make was a little

3960
03:31:03,720 --> 03:31:11,399
bit about uh sanjoy as a a professor a

3961
03:31:08,720 --> 03:31:14,560
teacher and other people have commented

3962
03:31:11,399 --> 03:31:17,680
on this um I had the pleasure of being

3963
03:31:14,560 --> 03:31:20,960
his ta also so which was a really fun

3964
03:31:17,680 --> 03:31:22,560
experience um because sanjo is brilliant

3965
03:31:20,960 --> 03:31:24,399
you know and he would give these

3966
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:27,080
lectures I think dynamic programming was

3967
03:31:24,399 --> 03:31:29,040
the course um and I'd be like wow that's

3968
03:31:27,080 --> 03:31:31,680
very cool but then soon I got to

3969
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:34,560
thinking I'm not sure the students are

3970
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:36,720
following what is happening here and I

3971
03:31:34,560 --> 03:31:39,479
would then find out later in you know in

3972
03:31:36,720 --> 03:31:43,840
office hours as I would try to you know

3973
03:31:39,479 --> 03:31:46,040
help and that also shaped uh uh my uh

3974
03:31:43,840 --> 03:31:49,040
myself and influenced my my teaching and

3975
03:31:46,040 --> 03:31:53,560
so on um both in positive and in

3976
03:31:49,040 --> 03:31:55,399
negative ways but uh so I think when we

3977
03:31:53,560 --> 03:31:58,479
think about San's intellectual Legacy

3978
03:31:55,399 --> 03:32:02,279
you know it's it's broad deep and

3979
03:31:58,479 --> 03:32:05,960
embodied in people and uh

faculty who didn't speak so far right uh

4261
05:05:07,638 --> 05:05:14,040
that's uh that's where it is uh my name

4262
05:05:10,120 --> 05:05:16,320
is Le J I'm going to start this and um

4263
05:05:14,040 --> 05:05:18,080
you know uh I have a confession to make

4264
05:05:16,320 --> 05:05:21,080
that when we were organizing this I

4265
05:05:18,080 --> 05:05:23,920
didn't plan to talk uh but when we put

4266
05:05:21,080 --> 05:05:27,600
this together I started to realize uh

4267
05:05:23,920 --> 05:05:30,558
that uh um there we are actually on a

4268
05:05:27,600 --> 05:05:31,840
smaller fraction of uh current uh

4269
05:05:30,558 --> 05:05:35,798
resident at

4270
05:05:31,840 --> 05:05:37,000
MIT um that uh we still know where was

4271
05:05:35,798 --> 05:05:39,798
building

4272
05:05:37,000 --> 05:05:43,600
35 and more and more people are hired

4273
05:05:39,798 --> 05:05:46,600
after we moved away from that and uh I I

4274
05:05:43,600 --> 05:05:49,240
you know many of you mentioned that SRO

4275
05:05:46,600 --> 05:05:51,680
likes to wander around talk to people

4276
05:05:49,240 --> 05:05:54,520
and uh personally if I close my eyes

4277
05:05:51,680 --> 05:05:57,200
think of where Sandro was walking around

4278
05:05:54,520 --> 05:06:00,558
the background was building 35 it was it

4279
05:05:57,200 --> 05:06:04,480
was a it was that big uh big Corridor

4280
05:06:00,558 --> 05:06:07,440
and um yeah I I actually um

4281
05:06:04,480 --> 05:06:10,840
met sorry I I I first met I I'm really

4282
05:06:07,440 --> 05:06:14,160
not good at doing this I I I I first met

4283
05:06:10,840 --> 05:06:17,160
sandre uh in that building uh when I was

4284
05:06:14,160 --> 05:06:20,878

4285
05:06:17,160 --> 05:06:24,040

couple of SC for for coffee and at the

4287
05:06:24,040 --> 05:06:28,400
at the time the only place you can get

4288
05:06:26,400 --> 05:06:31,120
coffee from building 35 is across the

4289
05:06:28,400 --> 05:06:34,520
street to the to the student center and

4290
05:06:31,120 --> 05:06:36,480

visitor uh little little did I know at

4296
05:06:47,160 --> 05:06:53,080
the time that this same meeting probably

day you can see him and uh uh Sandry

4301
05:07:03,240 --> 05:07:07,320

4307
05:07:17,480 --> 05:07:23,558
very extensive meeting uh with with with

4308
05:07:20,718 --> 05:07:25,320
C like hours and hours of of real

4309
05:07:23,558 --> 05:07:28,040
technical discussion you know that

4310
05:07:25,320 --> 05:07:31,958
started from how are you doing that kind

4311
05:07:28,040 --> 05:07:33,520
of a uh random encounter and uh um you

4312
05:07:31,958 --> 05:07:36,080
know when when we were organizing this

4313
05:07:33,520 --> 05:07:39,280
meeting I I talked to uh Bob Gallagher

4314
05:07:36,080 --> 05:07:42,200
who's the co- director with with SRE for

4315
05:07:39,280 --> 05:07:44,240
long time and uh uh by the way he sent

4316
05:07:42,200 --> 05:07:46,400
in a video message together with a lot

4317
05:07:44,240 --> 05:07:48,840
of other video messages and written

4318
05:07:46,400 --> 05:07:52,040
messages we're going to do them at 4M

4319
05:07:48,840 --> 05:07:54,760
last session and uh and Bob mentioned

4320
05:07:52,040 --> 05:07:56,760
that besides all the really exciting

4321
05:07:54,760 --> 05:08:02,040
technical contribution that sandre has

4322
05:07:56,760 --> 05:08:05,680
made sandre was also a exceptional

4323
05:08:02,040 --> 05:08:09,160
leader that his contribution to MIT was

4324
05:08:05,680 --> 05:08:13,200
to make LD a very pleasant place that

4325
05:08:09,160 --> 05:08:15,718
people like to work together um you know

4326
05:08:13,200 --> 05:08:18,200
you know come to this place to work and

4327
05:08:15,718 --> 05:08:21,920
I I I sometimes when I look back to that

4328
05:08:18,200 --> 05:08:24,480
uh uh kind of memory I I feel uh maybe

4329
05:08:21,920 --> 05:08:27,400
maybe um maybe I was really really young

4330
05:08:24,480 --> 05:08:31,440
and naive at the time but uh but the

4331
05:08:27,400 --> 05:08:34,440
feeling was life was simpler when sway

4332
05:08:31,440 --> 05:08:36,400
people were around and we we we we

4333
05:08:34,440 --> 05:08:38,160
didn't have to worry about that many

4334
05:08:36,400 --> 05:08:40,840
things we don't worry about where money

4335
05:08:38,160 --> 05:08:43,240
come from where do we publish this stuff

4336
05:08:40,840 --> 05:08:45,480
and uh those graduate student they they

4337
05:08:43,240 --> 05:08:47,280
just do not worry about a thing at all

4338
05:08:45,480 --> 05:08:50,120
right and uh we we're just a whole bunch

4339
05:08:47,280 --> 05:08:53,320
of young people coming together figure

4340
05:08:50,120 --> 05:08:54,878
things out right and uh uh we we figure

4341
05:08:53,320 --> 05:08:56,718
out one thing we talk about it then we

4342
05:08:54,878 --> 05:08:59,718
figure out the next thing and uh and

4343
05:08:56,718 --> 05:09:03,558
there was a pure joy of uh uh

4344
05:08:59,718 --> 05:09:05,718
intellectual um you know exchange and uh

4345
05:09:03,558 --> 05:09:10,680
I think I think I'm speaking at the

4346
05:09:05,718 --> 05:09:14,440
receiving end of this of having s as a a

4347
05:09:10,680 --> 05:09:17,600
senior you know Mentor colleague then we

4348
05:09:14,440 --> 05:09:20,160
we are we enjoying that and I think what

4349
05:09:17,600 --> 05:09:22,480
um the environment at the time um I

4350
05:09:20,160 --> 05:09:25,200
think as who call that a calm

4351
05:09:22,480 --> 05:09:27,200
environment uh love call that a sense of

4352
05:09:25,200 --> 05:09:30,080
confidence I think that these are all

4353
05:09:27,200 --> 05:09:33,000
right on uh what we got the feeling at

4354
05:09:30,080 --> 05:09:35,558
the time was uh was just uh you know if

4355
05:09:33,000 --> 05:09:38,000
we just keep on doing what we're doing

4356
05:09:35,558 --> 05:09:40,680
then every other problem in life would

4357
05:09:38,000 --> 05:09:42,760
just solve themselves right see that was

4358
05:09:40,680 --> 05:09:45,920
um you know you could call that a

4359
05:09:42,760 --> 05:09:49,120
correct or wrong uh view but uh but it

4360
05:09:45,920 --> 05:09:52,440
was really enjoyable and I I I will

4361
05:09:49,120 --> 05:09:52,440
remember sway because of

4362
05:09:57,250 --> 05:10:00,459
[Applause]

4363
05:10:05,600 --> 05:10:11,958
that all right uh

4364
05:10:09,600 --> 05:10:14,400
I thought I will use some slides with

4365
05:10:11,958 --> 05:10:16,520
some pictures not necessarily pictures

4366
05:10:14,400 --> 05:10:19,080
of sanjoy

4367
05:10:16,520 --> 05:10:23,798
himself but pictures that reminds me of

4368
05:10:19,080 --> 05:10:27,360
him um all right so let's see as they

4369
05:10:23,798 --> 05:10:31,440
come up uh so I met sanj first time on

4370
05:10:27,360 --> 05:10:32,520
April 5th 20 2004 literally four plus 20

4371
05:10:31,440 --> 05:10:35,120
plus years

4372
05:10:32,520 --> 05:10:38,958
ago uh there was a that was the day I

4373
05:10:35,120 --> 05:10:41,200
was interviewing here at MIT um and he

4374
05:10:38,958 --> 05:10:43,798
was of the earliest members I met among

4375
05:10:41,200 --> 05:10:46,440
LS faculty members I had 4-day visit and

4376
05:10:43,798 --> 05:10:49,400
I think I met him four different times

4377
05:10:46,440 --> 05:10:52,680
uh he didn't take me to mandarine but he

4378
05:10:49,400 --> 05:10:55,440
took me to Royale East and that was a

4379
05:10:52,680 --> 05:10:58,638
definitely an enjoyable meal uh more for

4380
05:10:55,440 --> 05:11:00,280
the conversation than just uh food but

4381
05:10:58,638 --> 05:11:04,798
then I kept going to a royist by the way

4382
05:11:00,280 --> 05:11:06,400
after that uh uh as all of us have

4383
05:11:04,798 --> 05:11:08,040
spoken about sanj I was always curious

4384
05:11:06,400 --> 05:11:11,000
about what's going on in your life in

4385
05:11:08,040 --> 05:11:12,558
your group students Etc and as I was

4386
05:11:11,000 --> 05:11:15,520
sorting through my pictures I trying to

4387
05:11:12,558 --> 05:11:17,440
find the latest picture where he was

4388
05:11:15,520 --> 05:11:21,878
fully involved in all sorts of thesis

4389
05:11:17,440 --> 05:11:24,280
and all that and so maybe if I can do

4390
05:11:21,878 --> 05:11:26,760
this these are just of two pictures that

4391
05:11:24,280 --> 05:11:29,920
came out um and as you can tell he was

4392
05:11:26,760 --> 05:11:33,520
on those thesis committees with uh uh

4393
05:11:29,920 --> 05:11:35,040
some of colleagues here uh and that was

4394
05:11:33,520 --> 05:11:37,200
always great you know he's always

4395
05:11:35,040 --> 05:11:39,760
interested like uh one of my student

4396
05:11:37,200 --> 05:11:41,920
finished his thesis in

4397
05:11:39,760 --> 05:11:43,240
2022 and he immediately sent a note

4398
05:11:41,920 --> 05:11:45,160
saying that hey I'm really interested in

4399
05:11:43,240 --> 05:11:47,480
doing this send me let's get on Zoom

4400
05:11:45,160 --> 05:11:48,440
call and we had a long conversation so

4401
05:11:47,480 --> 05:11:52,600
that was

4402
05:11:48,440 --> 05:11:54,718
him uh for me personally he played u a

4403
05:11:52,600 --> 05:11:59,440
huge role I'm just eternally grateful to

4404
05:11:54,718 --> 05:12:01,680
him uh one thing is when I joined MIT uh

4405
05:11:59,440 --> 05:12:04,480
many of you might remember uh the

4406
05:12:01,680 --> 05:12:07,920
precursor of idss was Engineering

4407
05:12:04,480 --> 05:12:10,760
Systems Division and my position was

4408
05:12:07,920 --> 05:12:12,878
half Engineering Systems Division and uh

4409
05:12:10,760 --> 05:12:14,360
eecs and at that time in Engineering

4410
05:12:12,878 --> 05:12:17,240
Systems division there was no faculty

4411
05:12:14,360 --> 05:12:20,120
member from Leeds or eecs at large and

4412
05:12:17,240 --> 05:12:22,638
he' made a huge gesture of joining it

4413
05:12:20,120 --> 05:12:24,200
halime which now in hindsight I see how

4414
05:12:22,638 --> 05:12:26,878
big it is I don't know if I will do it

4415
05:12:24,200 --> 05:12:29,280
but it was amazing in a sense that was

4416
05:12:26,878 --> 05:12:31,798
his view I believe and this is something

4417
05:12:29,280 --> 05:12:35,400
I would attribute to Ramesh as in Ramesh

4418
05:12:31,798 --> 05:12:39,320
ji one of my same AG uh former graduate

4419
05:12:35,400 --> 05:12:41,480
from Lids his view was that I think or

4420
05:12:39,320 --> 05:12:44,520
view was that Sunjoy prior about people

4421
05:12:41,480 --> 05:12:46,280
was very simple these are amazing people

4422
05:12:44,520 --> 05:12:48,600
okay no matter who the person is and he

4423
05:12:46,280 --> 05:12:51,718
would fully believe in that prior and

4424
05:12:48,600 --> 05:12:51,718
typically he would not go to

4425
05:12:51,840 --> 05:12:58,920
posterior uh and that was him uh when I

4426
05:12:55,160 --> 05:13:00,000
started uh in my first year at uh I

4427
05:12:58,920 --> 05:13:02,600
wanted to develop a course on

4428
05:13:00,000 --> 05:13:04,878
Engineering Systems Division and then he

4429
05:13:02,600 --> 05:13:06,280
helped me developed the course and the

4430
05:13:04,878 --> 05:13:08,120
interesting thing was is just do what

4431
05:13:06,280 --> 05:13:11,400
you think is the

4432
05:13:08,120 --> 05:13:15,200
best when uh help was needed he was the

4433
05:13:11,400 --> 05:13:16,680
one of the invisible hands and so thank

4434
05:13:15,200 --> 05:13:18,558
you about

4435
05:13:16,680 --> 05:13:23,040
that coming

4436
05:13:18,558 --> 05:13:24,718
to pictures now so as many of us have

4437
05:13:23,040 --> 05:13:26,600
heard multiple times that he would come

4438
05:13:24,718 --> 05:13:29,520
and ask you stop by our office whatever

4439
05:13:26,600 --> 05:13:31,320
it means what's new like the few minutes

4440
05:13:29,520 --> 05:13:34,120
ago Pablo stopped me and asked me what's

4441
05:13:31,320 --> 05:13:37,480
new reminded me of that and the

4442
05:13:34,120 --> 05:13:39,480
typically uh initially my response was I

4443
05:13:37,480 --> 05:13:40,718
would sort of prepare for that right soj

4444
05:13:39,480 --> 05:13:42,840
is going to come this week maybe

4445
05:13:40,718 --> 05:13:44,400
tomorrow what am I going to tell him new

4446
05:13:42,840 --> 05:13:47,480
that's different from last week because

4447
05:13:44,400 --> 05:13:49,480
he didn't forget so after a while I

4448
05:13:47,480 --> 05:13:51,958
realized that the best response to that

4449
05:13:49,480 --> 05:13:54,200
was hey let's go get

4450
05:13:51,958 --> 05:13:56,360
coffee uh why don't we go get coffee

4451
05:13:54,200 --> 05:13:58,480
because that's what I will explain you

4452
05:13:56,360 --> 05:14:00,160
what's new and of course then was never

4453
05:13:58,480 --> 05:14:03,718
what's new came up and then you would go

4454
05:14:00,160 --> 05:14:07,958
with him where you go to not so great uh

4455
05:14:03,718 --> 05:14:10,840
Starbucks minus minus uh in in the in

4456
05:14:07,958 --> 05:14:13,120
the building 32 or somewhere else he

4457
05:14:10,840 --> 05:14:15,240
would sort of carefully tell them give

4458
05:14:13,120 --> 05:14:18,400
me macchiato and macchiato is made this

4459
05:14:15,240 --> 05:14:22,040
way literally like that recipe uh so

4460
05:14:18,400 --> 05:14:24,200
that was always uh amusing and uh

4461
05:14:22,040 --> 05:14:27,798
great

4462
05:14:24,200 --> 05:14:30,200
um I'm sure you remember uh the pen that

4463
05:14:27,798 --> 05:14:33,280
sanjoy always carried around with him

4464
05:14:30,200 --> 05:14:37,558
very quintessential scholar in my mind

4465
05:14:33,280 --> 05:14:40,558
um so I'll tell one story around that I

4466
05:14:37,558 --> 05:14:43,558
think this was 2006 2007 just around the

4467
05:14:40,558 --> 05:14:46,718
time when we had started I think Greg

4468
05:14:43,558 --> 05:14:48,320
teaching graphical models so thinking

4469
05:14:46,718 --> 05:14:49,680
about uh I was telling him this is what

4470
05:14:48,320 --> 05:14:51,160
you're thinking part of that is

4471
05:14:49,680 --> 05:14:53,840
variational characterization and all

4472
05:14:51,160 --> 05:14:56,520
that he says oh that's uh Gibbs

4473
05:14:53,840 --> 05:14:59,760
variational or Gibbs maximal and Georgie

4474
05:14:56,520 --> 05:15:01,680
and all that came up and I said hm

4475
05:14:59,760 --> 05:15:05,160
because I knew certain way of thinking

4476
05:15:01,680 --> 05:15:08,000
about it and then he caught the H in my

4477
05:15:05,160 --> 05:15:10,600
face without me saying so next day late

4478
05:15:08,000 --> 05:15:11,840
morning I roll in and then I see on my

4479
05:15:10,600 --> 05:15:14,878
desk this

4480
05:15:11,840 --> 05:15:16,798
beautiful uh A4 likely Rachel you might

4481
05:15:14,878 --> 05:15:18,878
have come and dropped it uh in his

4482
05:15:16,798 --> 05:15:21,958
beautiful handwriting one and a half or

4483
05:15:18,878 --> 05:15:25,280
even one and less than that page note of

4484
05:15:21,958 --> 05:15:28,798
just a simple proof Jensen's inequality

4485
05:15:25,280 --> 05:15:33,000
uh that stuck with me uh and it was

4486
05:15:28,798 --> 05:15:34,760
correct and it was precise um was always

4487
05:15:33,000 --> 05:15:38,558
excited about talk about everything so

4488
05:15:34,760 --> 05:15:43,440
this was 2012 when I just got back from

4489
05:15:38,558 --> 05:15:47,520
my sabatical at Stanford and um I was

4490
05:15:43,440 --> 05:15:51,360
thinking about doing uh um engaging into

4491
05:15:47,520 --> 05:15:53,840
the uh commercial world uh think about

4492
05:15:51,360 --> 05:15:55,400
sort of starting a company and then I I

4493
05:15:53,840 --> 05:15:57,000
was telling him this is what happened I

4494
05:15:55,400 --> 05:15:59,520
really enjoyed my time at Netflix but

4495
05:15:57,000 --> 05:16:01,840
this is what I think it's oh great why

4496
05:15:59,520 --> 05:16:04,440
don't you prepare a pitch for me and

4497
05:16:01,840 --> 05:16:08,558
give it to me as if I'm a VC I said are

4498
05:16:04,440 --> 05:16:11,320
you sure he said yes so then a week

4499
05:16:08,558 --> 05:16:13,840
later to that me

4500
05:16:11,320 --> 05:16:15,520
now but so he listens to it carefully at

4501
05:16:13,840 --> 05:16:18,200
the end he says I think you need to work

4502
05:16:15,520 --> 05:16:21,320
harder so there was that and what was

4503
05:16:18,200 --> 05:16:22,920
very useful uh uh goes without saying

4504
05:16:21,320 --> 05:16:26,320
any seminar is interesting happening

4505
05:16:22,920 --> 05:16:27,760
whether it's by chomsky's yet another on

4506
05:16:26,320 --> 05:16:30,080
uh you know he had a sequence of those

4507
05:16:27,760 --> 05:16:32,000
things or whether it's yet another young

4508
05:16:30,080 --> 05:16:33,878
kid coming and giving talk about some

4509
05:16:32,000 --> 05:16:35,920
interesting math problem he would always

4510
05:16:33,878 --> 05:16:38,878
show up and take you

4511
05:16:35,920 --> 05:16:41,878
around uh one thing that always remind

4512
05:16:38,878 --> 05:16:43,840
Ed me in addition to his watch is that

4513
05:16:41,878 --> 05:16:46,638
he was interested in things which were

4514
05:16:43,840 --> 05:16:48,680
always Timeless right he always asked a

4515
05:16:46,638 --> 05:16:50,160
question that uh so what's the abstract

4516
05:16:48,680 --> 05:16:53,440
meaning of this what is the essence of

4517
05:16:50,160 --> 05:16:56,958
it uh he lowed as some of you pointed

4518
05:16:53,440 --> 05:17:00,120
out that the principle of

4519
05:16:56,958 --> 05:17:01,440
uh the separation it's the right way of

4520
05:17:00,120 --> 05:17:05,558
thinking about it's very important to

4521
05:17:01,440 --> 05:17:07,520
know abstractly what's happening and

4522
05:17:05,558 --> 05:17:10,320
behind that I always found that his view

4523
05:17:07,520 --> 05:17:13,638
was that look we academics we educators

4524
05:17:10,320 --> 05:17:15,638
are guardians of uh important knowledge

4525
05:17:13,638 --> 05:17:18,160
that needs to be passed on to next

4526
05:17:15,638 --> 05:17:19,638
Generation rather than we owning it and

4527
05:17:18,160 --> 05:17:23,200
sometimes you know we do get personal

4528
05:17:19,638 --> 05:17:25,760
and I thought his non-personal take on

4529
05:17:23,200 --> 05:17:28,558
that was just beautiful and clean and uh

4530
05:17:25,760 --> 05:17:31,638
just uh something to Aspire

4531
05:17:28,558 --> 05:17:36,080
to and finally

4532
05:17:31,638 --> 05:17:39,280
um um you know he uh when Adriana passed

4533
05:17:36,080 --> 05:17:41,600
away uh just around that time I don't

4534
05:17:39,280 --> 05:17:44,520
remember exactly when but few days

4535
05:17:41,600 --> 05:17:47,000
later uh I was driving him from either

4536
05:17:44,520 --> 05:17:48,558
funeral home or something and then he he

4537
05:17:47,000 --> 05:17:50,638
he made this comment which I thought was

4538
05:17:48,558 --> 05:17:53,600
uh pretty remarkable simple but

4539
05:17:50,638 --> 05:17:55,080
remarkable is that you know people do

4540
05:17:53,600 --> 05:17:57,400
wonderful things you value them when

4541
05:17:55,080 --> 05:17:59,000
they are around there's a hole that they

4542
05:17:57,400 --> 05:18:03,840
leave and you don't know how big a hole

4543
05:17:59,000 --> 05:18:03,840
that is till they're gone so on that

4544
05:18:04,340 --> 05:18:10,080
[Applause]

4545
05:18:12,760 --> 05:18:17,080
uh hello everyone my name is Yuri pansy

4546
05:18:15,280 --> 05:18:19,840
I'm a faculty at Le I work on

4547
05:18:17,080 --> 05:18:21,878
information Theory I do I'll try to be

4548
05:18:19,840 --> 05:18:24,840
brief so we have more time for you know

4549
05:18:21,878 --> 05:18:27,878
mo and Greg to say more things I have

4550
05:18:24,840 --> 05:18:29,840
never been to building 35 I did not

4551
05:18:27,878 --> 05:18:33,120
benefit from that magnificent grant that

4552
05:18:29,840 --> 05:18:36,360
Lids you know was getting in the time of

4553
05:18:33,120 --> 05:18:39,000
sanjy right so I I never can share my

4554
05:18:36,360 --> 05:18:41,520
sort of stories from that but I wanted

4555
05:18:39,000 --> 05:18:44,920
to take you back to uh an important day

4556
05:18:41,520 --> 05:18:47,520
in my life which was May 4th 2006 so

4557
05:18:44,920 --> 05:18:49,958
this was the end of my first year uh in

4558
05:18:47,520 --> 05:18:53,040
grad school and uh I I I was an

4559
05:18:49,958 --> 05:18:55,558
undergrad uh majoring in physics and I

4560
05:18:53,040 --> 05:18:57,120
did uh a master's project in system

4561
05:18:55,558 --> 05:18:58,400
identification so I decided to switch to

4562
05:18:57,120 --> 05:19:00,120
electrical engineering but I was

4563
05:18:58,400 --> 05:19:02,480
completely clueless like I did not know

4564
05:19:00,120 --> 05:19:04,120
who Shannon is I did not understand

4565
05:19:02,480 --> 05:19:06,200
anything about digital communication and

4566
05:19:04,120 --> 05:19:08,200
all our seminars were constantly you

4567
05:19:06,200 --> 05:19:09,638
know myo block fading you know error

4568
05:19:08,200 --> 05:19:11,440
exponents

4569
05:19:09,638 --> 05:19:12,878
you know network capacity power control

4570
05:19:11,440 --> 05:19:13,958
I didn't understand a single word of it

4571
05:19:12,878 --> 05:19:15,480
so I thought okay this is probably a

4572
05:19:13,958 --> 05:19:17,160
mistake I should just go back home you

4573
05:19:15,480 --> 05:19:19,440
know back to Russia and just have an

4574
05:19:17,160 --> 05:19:21,320
industry job but then you know this was

4575
05:19:19,440 --> 05:19:22,920
the end of the first year when you in

4576
05:19:21,320 --> 05:19:24,840
Princeton you have to do all the uh

4577
05:19:22,920 --> 05:19:26,000
classes and so on and then it's time for

4578
05:19:24,840 --> 05:19:28,360
you to you know choose adviser and

4579
05:19:26,000 --> 05:19:29,798
choose a topic you know so I was in this

4580
05:19:28,360 --> 05:19:32,718
turbulent moment where you know I wasn't

4581
05:19:29,798 --> 05:19:34,400
sure what I want to work on and so um

4582
05:19:32,718 --> 05:19:37,160
this was I I should tell you that this

4583
05:19:34,400 --> 05:19:40,520
was a couple of years after you know um

4584
05:19:37,160 --> 05:19:42,440
sahai taond and sorry sahai meter and

4585
05:19:40,520 --> 05:19:45,000
Tonda meter happened so everybody was

4586
05:19:42,440 --> 05:19:47,638
thinking about control and communication

4587
05:19:45,000 --> 05:19:48,958
so uh my advisor Sergio Verdu and Vince

4588
05:19:47,638 --> 05:19:50,440
poor were also very interested in this

4589
05:19:48,958 --> 05:19:54,280
so they kind of encouraged me to go to

4590
05:19:50,440 --> 05:19:55,798
this talk um so the talk was uh titled

4591
05:19:54,280 --> 05:19:58,200
information and entropy flow in

4592
05:19:55,798 --> 05:20:02,240
filtering and path estimation this was

4593
05:19:58,200 --> 05:20:04,160
uh sanjoy talk of course and um I should

4594
05:20:02,240 --> 05:20:07,200
say I sat in the talk just like the

4595
05:20:04,160 --> 05:20:09,240
usual I understood 0% of it it was it

4596
05:20:07,200 --> 05:20:10,240
was even harder than you know iCal talk

4597
05:20:09,240 --> 05:20:12,480
because here there was not even

4598
05:20:10,240 --> 05:20:14,680
beautiful pictures right of radios you

4599
05:20:12,480 --> 05:20:17,160
know and and radio waves so there was

4600
05:20:14,680 --> 05:20:19,000
absolutely pure math you know and but

4601
05:20:17,160 --> 05:20:20,520
the last two sentences of the abstract

4602
05:20:19,000 --> 05:20:22,200
stood with me and so let me just read

4603
05:20:20,520 --> 05:20:23,400
them We examined the structure of

4604
05:20:22,200 --> 05:20:24,958
interaction between sensing

4605
05:20:23,400 --> 05:20:26,840
communication communicating and

4606
05:20:24,958 --> 05:20:28,440
controlling in the context of

4607
05:20:26,840 --> 05:20:30,558
statistical filtering for signals

4608
05:20:28,440 --> 05:20:32,120
described as hidden Mark of processes

4609
05:20:30,558 --> 05:20:34,400
and in the context of stabilization of

4610
05:20:32,120 --> 05:20:36,240
an unstable control system where the

4611
05:20:34,400 --> 05:20:38,760
sensor and controller are linked where

4612
05:20:36,240 --> 05:20:40,360
via a noisy Communication channel we we

4613
05:20:38,760 --> 05:20:42,520
argue amongst other things that a

4614
05:20:40,360 --> 05:20:44,480
fundamental reexamination of information

4615
05:20:42,520 --> 05:20:46,400
theory is needed to address these

4616
05:20:44,480 --> 05:20:48,760
questions these ideas appear to have

4617
05:20:46,400 --> 05:20:51,638
nontrivial connections to recent work in

4618
05:20:48,760 --> 05:20:53,638
non-e equilibrium statistical mechanics

4619
05:20:51,638 --> 05:20:55,320
okay so I should tell you that again I

4620
05:20:53,638 --> 05:20:58,080
do not know what information theory is

4621
05:20:55,320 --> 05:20:59,320
but here's the you know a sage of MIT

4622
05:20:58,080 --> 05:21:00,680
right coming and telling me that

4623
05:20:59,320 --> 05:21:03,120
information theory is something that

4624
05:21:00,680 --> 05:21:04,958
needs to be Revisited A and B he's

4625
05:21:03,120 --> 05:21:06,480
telling me this has connection to

4626
05:21:04,958 --> 05:21:08,360
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics

4627
05:21:06,480 --> 05:21:09,840
I'm a physicist right I understand that

4628
05:21:08,360 --> 05:21:12,798
stuff so I say okay finally that's a

4629
05:21:09,840 --> 05:21:14,320
field where I can be helpful right so um

4630
05:21:12,798 --> 05:21:16,160
so that's you know sort of the rest is

4631
05:21:14,320 --> 05:21:18,520
history I went to do PhD in in

4632
05:21:16,160 --> 05:21:20,718
information Theory I also should say I

4633
05:21:18,520 --> 05:21:23,558
quickly learned that you know knowing

4634
05:21:20,718 --> 05:21:25,280
what entropy is in the physics uh World

4635
05:21:23,558 --> 05:21:27,080
actually is detrimental for being an

4636
05:21:25,280 --> 05:21:30,040
information theorist and detrimental for

4637
05:21:27,080 --> 05:21:33,200
your sanity as well so I quickly decided

4638
05:21:30,040 --> 05:21:35,958
to forget about that uh so then 5 years

4639
05:21:33,200 --> 05:21:38,920
later I came here for uh Muriel Mard

4640
05:21:35,958 --> 05:21:40,718
invited me for um a small talk for her

4641
05:21:38,920 --> 05:21:42,440
group and this was like the time when I

4642
05:21:40,718 --> 05:21:45,200
was supposed to be you know on a job

4643
05:21:42,440 --> 05:21:47,840
market so there was nobody no faculty

4644
05:21:45,200 --> 05:21:49,600
showed up except her and um and at the

4645
05:21:47,840 --> 05:21:52,280
very end there was you know sanra meer

4646
05:21:49,600 --> 05:21:54,920
who uh I think walked in halfway through

4647
05:21:52,280 --> 05:21:56,280
the talk and you know so I gave my talk

4648
05:21:54,920 --> 05:21:57,680
and students were very interested you

4649
05:21:56,280 --> 05:21:59,840
know we chatted with Muriel and so on

4650
05:21:57,680 --> 05:22:02,558
sanre never said a single word but you

4651
05:21:59,840 --> 05:22:05,440
know the next day I received his 11w

4652
05:22:02,558 --> 05:22:06,878
email which I want to quote to you um

4653
05:22:05,440 --> 05:22:08,360
because I also emailed him and I said I

4654
05:22:06,878 --> 05:22:10,400
saw you in my talk you know maybe we

4655
05:22:08,360 --> 05:22:12,480
should should meet and said he responded

4656
05:22:10,400 --> 05:22:15,280
with 11 words we will have to meet

4657
05:22:12,480 --> 05:22:17,120
another time I enjoyed your talk period

4658
05:22:15,280 --> 05:22:19,160
right so this actually you know again

4659
05:22:17,120 --> 05:22:21,480
this made a big impact on my life

4660
05:22:19,160 --> 05:22:24,080
because at that time I think I I applied

4661
05:22:21,480 --> 05:22:25,798
to grad to to faculty positions but I

4662
05:22:24,080 --> 05:22:27,520
also got a job offer from Bell laabs and

4663
05:22:25,798 --> 05:22:28,920
I was actually thinking about taking it

4664
05:22:27,520 --> 05:22:31,638
because I thought okay there's no point

4665
05:22:28,920 --> 05:22:34,440
you know the job market is so tough so

4666
05:22:31,638 --> 05:22:37,360
but this kind of encouraged me to um to

4667
05:22:34,440 --> 05:22:39,798
to stay so when I became a faculty in

4668
05:22:37,360 --> 05:22:42,840
leads uh I think in the first couple of

4669
05:22:39,798 --> 05:22:46,680
months I asked Sano if I can meet him

4670
05:22:42,840 --> 05:22:48,558
and I received another 11l email um from

4671
05:22:46,680 --> 05:22:50,200
him after our conversation he said by

4672
05:22:48,558 --> 05:22:52,840
the way you can talk you can walk into

4673
05:22:50,200 --> 05:22:55,280
my office anytime period again he was a

4674
05:22:52,840 --> 05:22:58,400
very friendly guy right we could always

4675
05:22:55,280 --> 05:23:01,120
um you could always come and talk to him

4676
05:22:58,400 --> 05:23:03,040
um what I think is something maybe not

4677
05:23:01,120 --> 05:23:04,480
everybody especially younger students

4678
05:23:03,040 --> 05:23:07,200
maybe don't realize that he was also

4679
05:23:04,480 --> 05:23:11,280
very quick to you know quip some kind of

4680
05:23:07,200 --> 05:23:12,520
fun joke uh so I remember this was again

4681
05:23:11,280 --> 05:23:14,798
maybe

4682
05:23:12,520 --> 05:23:17,120
2012 or 13 I was very interested in

4683
05:23:14,798 --> 05:23:19,520
combinatorics and with my friend Marco

4684
05:23:17,120 --> 05:23:23,920
Dalai we noticed that you know the

4685
05:23:19,520 --> 05:23:26,280
famous loas uh tetaun so l l loas is of

4686
05:23:23,920 --> 05:23:29,760
course the pillar of combinatorics right

4687
05:23:26,280 --> 05:23:31,638
he made his name uh uh by when he was

4688
05:23:29,760 --> 05:23:33,760
very young he proved the conjecture of

4689
05:23:31,638 --> 05:23:35,400
capacity of the Pentagon and there he

4690
05:23:33,760 --> 05:23:36,718
introduced Teta function and with Marco

4691
05:23:35,400 --> 05:23:38,558
we noticed that actually that was

4692
05:23:36,718 --> 05:23:41,400
already contained in Bob Gallagher's

4693
05:23:38,558 --> 05:23:43,320
work so if if you put together a paper

4694
05:23:41,400 --> 05:23:45,000
of Bob Gallagher and Fred gelin paper

4695
05:23:43,320 --> 05:23:47,240
they together already proved capacity of

4696
05:23:45,000 --> 05:23:49,160
the Pentagon so we were super excited

4697
05:23:47,240 --> 05:23:50,760
that that moment I told this to sanjoy

4698
05:23:49,160 --> 05:23:52,280
in the hallway and I said sanjo can you

4699
05:23:50,760 --> 05:23:53,840
believe it like all of this stuff that

4700
05:23:52,280 --> 05:23:55,040
you know this was actually in Bob

4701
05:23:53,840 --> 05:23:56,600
Gallagher's you know this is our

4702
05:23:55,040 --> 05:23:58,400
information theorist and at this time

4703
05:23:56,600 --> 05:23:59,520
Bob Gallagher was passing by and Bob

4704
05:23:58,400 --> 05:24:01,520
Gallagher said so what are you talking

4705
05:23:59,520 --> 05:24:04,080
about and sanre looked at me and said he

4706
05:24:01,520 --> 05:24:04,080
will make you

4707
05:24:05,878 --> 05:24:12,120
famous I I still remember that joke know

4708
05:24:08,760 --> 05:24:14,400
but um in any case

4709
05:24:12,120 --> 05:24:17,320
so yeah I wanted to finish by saying

4710
05:24:14,400 --> 05:24:19,120
that you know I still read that uh so I

4711
05:24:17,320 --> 05:24:20,958
I read that that that paper and that you

4712
05:24:19,120 --> 05:24:23,440
know my notes from sanjoy talk many

4713
05:24:20,958 --> 05:24:25,160
times I think I made it to about 50%

4714
05:24:23,440 --> 05:24:27,400
understanding but I hope to catch up in

4715
05:24:25,160 --> 05:24:30,230
the in the remaining sort of time in my

4716
05:24:27,400 --> 05:24:33,410
career thank you

4717
05:24:30,230 --> 05:24:33,410

fashion um you know a lot of people talk

4738
05:25:49,718 --> 05:25:54,400
about sanjoy being so subtle and he

4739
05:25:52,360 --> 05:25:57,280
doesn't tell you what you have to go and

4740
05:25:54,400 --> 05:25:59,680
figure out I felt a little different cuz

4741
05:25:57,280 --> 05:26:02,638

4742
05:25:59,680 --> 05:26:05,080

4743
05:26:02,638 --> 05:26:07,680

4748
05:26:16,080 --> 05:26:23,680
I'm just starting out here so anyway so

4749
05:26:19,638 --> 05:26:27,040
I remember sanjoy commenting uh about my

4750
05:26:23,680 --> 05:26:30,520
uh suits and uh he told me a few places

4751
05:26:27,040 --> 05:26:32,280
to to shop in fact this morning uh I

4752
05:26:30,520 --> 05:26:34,160
asked my wife you know just to think of

4753
05:26:32,280 --> 05:26:36,080
sanjo I'm going to wear a linen suit

4754
05:26:34,160 --> 05:26:38,920
today because this is typically how I

4755
05:26:36,080 --> 05:26:40,760
see sanjo but you you know you tell me

4756
05:26:38,920 --> 05:26:43,920
which color I should pick and she said

4757
05:26:40,760 --> 05:26:46,080
you know wear this color and somehow it

4758
05:26:43,920 --> 05:26:49,280
sort of coordinated with him it was just

4759
05:26:46,080 --> 05:26:53,200
by by

4760
05:26:49,280 --> 05:26:55,920
chance um so we had uh some parties

4761
05:26:53,200 --> 05:26:59,440
together to sanjoy organized together

4762
05:26:55,920 --> 05:27:01,920
with my colleagues a lot of Italians

4763
05:26:59,440 --> 05:27:04,840
sanjy knows my colleagues and he

4764
05:27:01,920 --> 05:27:07,958
organize a party and it was interesting

4765
05:27:04,840 --> 05:27:11,680
party where you're required not to bring

4766
05:27:07,958 --> 05:27:13,798
any present but there's a raffle and

4767
05:27:11,680 --> 05:27:15,600
then you know everyone who come to the

4768
05:27:13,798 --> 05:27:20,240
party have a raffle so I'll say a few

4769
05:27:15,600 --> 05:27:22,558
names so over there uh here anjoy this

4770
05:27:20,240 --> 05:27:25,760
is Andrea jetti from University of

4771
05:27:22,558 --> 05:27:29,440
bolognia Andrea Conti from University of

4772
05:27:25,760 --> 05:27:32,000
Ferrara Alberto Rakin who is a European

4773
05:27:29,440 --> 05:27:34,958
Commission Now Greg Mitchell work in

4774
05:27:32,000 --> 05:27:39,480
Washington DC George Chrissy goes at

4775
05:27:34,958 --> 05:27:41,920
Qualcomm so sanjoy and Greg connected uh

4776
05:27:39,480 --> 05:27:43,958
quite well and it's interesting because

4777
05:27:41,920 --> 05:27:46,480
you know it takes you go and talk to

4778
05:27:43,958 --> 05:27:49,760
sanjo everybody mentioned already how

4779
05:27:46,480 --> 05:27:52,480
you go away with sort of feel like you

4780
05:27:49,760 --> 05:27:56,480
understand but you don't understand uh

4781
05:27:52,480 --> 05:27:59,080
but that was I think sanjoy DNA but Greg

4782
05:27:56,480 --> 05:28:01,360
was different he works in Washington and

4783
05:27:59,080 --> 05:28:03,520
I think he's trained to tell you a story

4784
05:28:01,360 --> 05:28:07,280
at the end of the story it has zero

4785
05:28:03,520 --> 05:28:10,080
entropy and but the two of them talk and

4786
05:28:07,280 --> 05:28:12,558
you know they can Converse uh and that

4787
05:28:10,080 --> 05:28:14,400
was something I remember from that party

4788
05:28:12,558 --> 05:28:17,360
and here's a party where sanro is

4789
05:28:14,400 --> 05:28:20,878
drawing a raffle and he's supposed to

4790
05:28:17,360 --> 05:28:23,520
get something so you know everybody uh

4791
05:28:20,878 --> 05:28:27,160
wear a uh everybody pick

4792
05:28:23,520 --> 05:28:30,360
a a ticket and they find out what's in

4793
05:28:27,160 --> 05:28:33,798
there and this is a picture of West

4794
05:28:30,360 --> 05:28:37,520
Harris Sandra and this is Marco

4795
05:28:33,798 --> 05:28:39,280
keani uh snow my wife Andrea conti and

4796
05:28:37,520 --> 05:28:44,600
this is my my

4797
05:28:39,280 --> 05:28:47,760
sister-in-law um and and uh at the party

4798
05:28:44,600 --> 05:28:49,160
I'll show you a couple more so that that

4799
05:28:47,760 --> 05:28:51,680
was just you

4800
05:28:49,160 --> 05:28:53,520
know need a little luck and a lot of

4801
05:28:51,680 --> 05:28:57,920
love and then you know you get the

4802
05:28:53,520 --> 05:28:59,400
winner so the party was planned in a way

4803
05:28:57,920 --> 05:29:02,878
that the

4804
05:28:59,400 --> 05:29:08,400
winners get little present and and

4805
05:29:02,878 --> 05:29:10,080
sanjoy had uh uh a tie here and West

4806
05:29:08,400 --> 05:29:13,920
also have a different color of ties and

4807
05:29:10,080 --> 05:29:17,000
so on and that was just a quite uh

4808
05:29:13,920 --> 05:29:19,558
memorable uh time for me and then

4809
05:29:17,000 --> 05:29:22,958
finally I wanted to talk about sanro

4810
05:29:19,558 --> 05:29:25,160
he's a center of gravity he attracted

4811
05:29:22,958 --> 05:29:27,320
many many colleagues who became my

4812
05:29:25,160 --> 05:29:29,240
collaborator and you know he would go on

4813
05:29:27,320 --> 05:29:32,680
the board and he explained to me so this

4814
05:29:29,240 --> 05:29:35,920
is the time where France laat from

4815
05:29:32,680 --> 05:29:38,320
University of uh uh wean Austria was

4816
05:29:35,920 --> 05:29:42,280
visiting a signal processing person and

4817
05:29:38,320 --> 05:29:44,958
that sanjo and he had a a talk and I was

4818
05:29:42,280 --> 05:29:47,280
there so I clicked the picture just so

4819
05:29:44,958 --> 05:29:50,920
that I can

4820
05:29:47,280 --> 05:29:55,360
remember uh so many people that come

4821
05:29:50,920 --> 05:29:57,520
around me end up uh close uh friends

4822
05:29:55,360 --> 05:30:01,798
with sanjoy and talk to them partly

4823
05:29:57,520 --> 05:30:03,680
because I think uh sanjoy is a very good

4824
05:30:01,798 --> 05:30:05,320
speaking Italian and my Italian

4825
05:30:03,680 --> 05:30:08,200
collaborator said he speak better

4826
05:30:05,320 --> 05:30:11,120
Italian than us

4827
05:30:08,200 --> 05:30:14,558
uh so this is another bonus day where we

4828
05:30:11,120 --> 05:30:17,040
had a party for Peter uh with a lot of

4829
05:30:14,558 --> 05:30:20,360
family and you can see everybody and the

4830
05:30:17,040 --> 05:30:23,280
center of attention was here and he is

4831
05:30:20,360 --> 05:30:26,320
sanjoy you know singing happy birthday

4832
05:30:23,280 --> 05:30:30,080
for Peter but I think attention was

4833
05:30:26,320 --> 05:30:32,878
really there and uh so I'm going to move

4834
05:30:30,080 --> 05:30:37,200
on so you know people talk about Royal

4835
05:30:32,878 --> 05:30:40,000
East and uh Mandarin uh restaurant but

4836
05:30:37,200 --> 05:30:42,600
with me was like some reason it's a

4837
05:30:40,000 --> 05:30:45,600
legal seafood we always get upgraded I

4838
05:30:42,600 --> 05:30:49,120
think from you know Mandarin to Legal

4839
05:30:45,600 --> 05:30:52,280
Seafood and sometimes we go to happy

4840
05:30:49,120 --> 05:30:53,958
hour oysters and uh I couldn't find the

4841
05:30:52,280 --> 05:30:55,798
pictures you know these days it's very

4842
05:30:53,958 --> 05:30:58,600
hard to search so I couldn't find as I

4843
05:30:55,798 --> 05:31:02,160
was trying to find sanjoy with a dozen

4844
05:30:58,600 --> 05:31:05,840
oysters that Peter would remember uh so

4845
05:31:02,160 --> 05:31:09,440
this is at legals sanjoy Marco keani

4846
05:31:05,840 --> 05:31:13,040
West Harris Peter f Andrea Cony and

4847
05:31:09,440 --> 05:31:16,040
myself this is probably about uh 78

4848
05:31:13,040 --> 05:31:19,360
years old photo so we have days like

4849
05:31:16,040 --> 05:31:21,320
that throughout the year and of course a

4850
05:31:19,360 --> 05:31:24,360
lot of technical interaction too which

4851
05:31:21,320 --> 05:31:26,600
I'm not going to mention uh there was

4852
05:31:24,360 --> 05:31:28,160
another time that I sort of St away I

4853
05:31:26,600 --> 05:31:30,680
thought that was interesting picture and

4854
05:31:28,160 --> 05:31:33,600
I wanted to save it and this was one of

4855
05:31:30,680 --> 05:31:35,120
the LDS event I forgot what event was

4856
05:31:33,600 --> 05:31:38,520
and some

4857
05:31:35,120 --> 05:31:40,520
reason Peter and Jose kind of get down

4858
05:31:38,520 --> 05:31:42,680
to business get a piece of paper and

4859
05:31:40,520 --> 05:31:44,558
they arriving in the middle of the party

4860
05:31:42,680 --> 05:31:45,558
sanjoy said you know I want to be a part

4861
05:31:44,558 --> 05:31:48,440
of

4862
05:31:45,558 --> 05:31:50,320
it that was it and I thought it was just

4863
05:31:48,440 --> 05:31:54,200
kind of a moment that I want to capture

4864
05:31:50,320 --> 05:31:58,680
so I I clicked that and I found this

4865
05:31:54,200 --> 05:32:00,840
uh so now you know I want to talk a

4866
05:31:58,680 --> 05:32:04,958
little bit about Cambridge tea party so

4867
05:32:00,840 --> 05:32:07,200
we had covid and after the co you know

4868
05:32:04,958 --> 05:32:10,718
we were all locked down and so on

4869
05:32:07,200 --> 05:32:13,160
everybody so re tired and then he wanted

4870
05:32:10,718 --> 05:32:15,360
to be a little rebellious so like a

4871
05:32:13,160 --> 05:32:19,798
Boston Tea Party there's a Cambridge tea

4872
05:32:15,360 --> 05:32:22,440
party and the Tea Party uh at uh Peter's

4873
05:32:19,798 --> 05:32:24,840
place and sanjoy came and we were very

4874
05:32:22,440 --> 05:32:26,958
happy to be out of it but notice that we

4875
05:32:24,840 --> 05:32:30,558
were sitting not so close to each other

4876
05:32:26,958 --> 05:32:34,718
it's just right after Co and and I

4877
05:32:30,558 --> 05:32:39,280
wanted to show you a few pictures uh um

4878
05:32:34,718 --> 05:32:42,080
of sanjoy uh before and after covid uh

4879
05:32:39,280 --> 05:32:45,040
so this is one night that I remember I

4880
05:32:42,080 --> 05:32:49,400
call him napolita KN because we have

4881
05:32:45,040 --> 05:32:53,040

4883
05:32:53,040 --> 05:32:58,120

home it's it's I think it was February

4885
05:32:58,120 --> 05:33:00,638
it's still cold outside so we couldn't

4886
05:32:59,798 --> 05:33:02,160
sit

4887
05:33:00,638 --> 05:33:05,878

05:33:02,160 --> 05:33:07,840
um uh there uh there's this beautiful

4889
05:33:05,878 --> 05:33:11,600

4895
05:33:24,840 --> 05:33:30,638
you know you can go to I think it's a

4896
05:33:27,798 --> 05:33:32,798
place called santagar and you can go to

4897
05:33:30,638 --> 05:33:35,600
the rich and you can see the two coast

4898
05:33:32,798 --> 05:33:38,120
of saleno and Naples and you know you

4899
05:33:35,600 --> 05:33:39,840
should really go there and you know you

4900
05:33:38,120 --> 05:33:43,520
should go find this little village

4901
05:33:39,840 --> 05:33:46,760
called narano and the you know pasta

4902
05:33:43,520 --> 05:33:49,558
there is really nothing like it you know

4903
05:33:46,760 --> 05:33:53,480
that kind of discussion that we have and

4904
05:33:49,558 --> 05:33:56,440
then you know the night goes on is is is

4905
05:33:53,480 --> 05:34:00,760
not a time yet for the last drop and uh

4906
05:33:56,440 --> 05:34:04,480
not a time yet to move on so it started

4907
05:34:00,760 --> 05:34:08,480
to talk about songs and turned out that

4908
05:34:04,480 --> 05:34:10,958
uh stano plays a little bit of guitar

4909
05:34:08,480 --> 05:34:14,798
and he was trying to teach me so I

4910
05:34:10,958 --> 05:34:16,440
wanted to show you uh a picture and

4911
05:34:14,798 --> 05:34:19,480
there's a little video you can start

4912
05:34:16,440 --> 05:34:23,480
like 20 second or so Stefano was playing

4913
05:34:19,480 --> 05:34:25,080
a napolitan song songs many but I just

4914
05:34:23,480 --> 05:34:26,250
only have a clip because I don't want to

4915
05:34:25,080 --> 05:34:28,638
take the whole

4916
05:34:26,250 --> 05:34:33,558
[Music]

4917
05:34:28,638 --> 05:34:37,210
afternoon so I kind of think of it as

4918
05:34:33,558 --> 05:34:42,669
night you will see sanjy and rea

4919
05:34:37,210 --> 05:34:42,669
[Music]

4920
05:34:44,680 --> 05:34:50,480
this is something I think about

4921
05:34:46,958 --> 05:34:50,480
often I'm like

4922
05:34:50,790 --> 05:34:57,400
[Music]

4923
05:34:54,400 --> 05:34:57,400
this

4924
05:35:01,958 --> 05:35:08,440
oh um so this is like Peter is saying

4925
05:35:06,120 --> 05:35:11,558
you know this is just

4926
05:35:08,440 --> 05:35:11,558
time to move

4927
05:35:11,718 --> 05:35:17,840
move um and I'll show you a few other uh

4928
05:35:15,080 --> 05:35:22,000
summer time we have a lot of good times

4929
05:35:17,840 --> 05:35:25,080
outside uh you know mostly around meal

4930
05:35:22,000 --> 05:35:27,920
and mostly around Rich conversation I'm

4931
05:35:25,080 --> 05:35:30,520
just not going to do to spend a lot just

4932
05:35:27,920 --> 05:35:36,480
just clicking through so give time for

4933
05:35:30,520 --> 05:35:39,000
Greg to talk uh um and um so I want to

4934
05:35:36,480 --> 05:35:42,798
talk a little bit about this picture

4935
05:35:39,000 --> 05:35:45,680
sanjoy was uh looking to move he was

4936
05:35:42,798 --> 05:35:49,638
dragging his feet uh he didn't wanted to

4937
05:35:45,680 --> 05:35:52,320
really move away from MIT I think he MIT

4938
05:35:49,638 --> 05:35:53,718
is so so much a part of him talking to

4939
05:35:52,320 --> 05:35:58,200
students and so

4940
05:35:53,718 --> 05:36:02,200
on and uh there was two option that that

4941
05:35:58,200 --> 05:36:04,878
uh of where he would stay and you know

4942
05:36:02,200 --> 05:36:07,878
and so I said you know I'm going to be

4943
05:36:04,878 --> 05:36:10,680
in uh London and I'll go check it out so

4944
05:36:07,878 --> 05:36:14,480
we went to EBY Road this is where Rea

4945
05:36:10,680 --> 05:36:17,000
lives and go check out sanj's place that

4946
05:36:14,480 --> 05:36:19,080
he was going to go anyway to fast

4947
05:36:17,000 --> 05:36:21,040
forward he moved there but he always

4948
05:36:19,080 --> 05:36:23,040
said let's have a zoom call where's your

4949
05:36:21,040 --> 05:36:26,320
student is he making progress let's have

4950
05:36:23,040 --> 05:36:28,958
some Zoom so we would have several Zoom

4951
05:36:26,320 --> 05:36:31,600
call over there and I asked him sanjo

4952
05:36:28,958 --> 05:36:35,120
how's the food did you like it well it's

4953
05:36:31,600 --> 05:36:37,920
adequate it's Ed they play piano for me

4954
05:36:35,120 --> 05:36:40,000
whenever the dinner time but the food is

4955
05:36:37,920 --> 05:36:43,958
just adequate but it's giv me nutrition

4956
05:36:40,000 --> 05:36:45,920
so I'm surviving so I said okay so do

4957
05:36:43,958 --> 05:36:48,840
you like it there he said like well you

4958
05:36:45,920 --> 05:36:50,160
know I like it there but they all are

4959
05:36:48,840 --> 05:36:54,240
old

4960
05:36:50,160 --> 05:36:56,798
people I said okay let's have a zoom

4961
05:36:54,240 --> 05:37:00,080
call so we have a zoom call and you know

4962
05:36:56,798 --> 05:37:03,120
we have a uh we had uh written a few

4963
05:37:00,080 --> 05:37:07,958
papers with sanjoy in his uh Golden

4964
05:37:03,120 --> 05:37:10,160
Years um which basically following again

4965
05:37:07,958 --> 05:37:12,958
the connection between Communications

4966
05:37:10,160 --> 05:37:17,718
control imperfect feedback limited

4967
05:37:12,958 --> 05:37:19,360
capacity that type of stuff uh and this

4968
05:37:17,718 --> 05:37:23,600
was

4969
05:37:19,360 --> 05:37:28,718
the last photo that I took with

4970
05:37:23,600 --> 05:37:30,638
him and uh San was again subtle but you

4971
05:37:28,718 --> 05:37:33,680
know he sort

4972
05:37:30,638 --> 05:37:35,638
of somehow get me a message that he

4973
05:37:33,680 --> 05:37:38,040
needed some

4974
05:37:35,638 --> 05:37:43,360
selos during Co

4975
05:37:38,040 --> 05:37:45,360
so I usually go to Costco every other uh

4976
05:37:43,360 --> 05:37:48,440
month whenever they have a sale I'll get

4977
05:37:45,360 --> 05:37:50,240
him a box and so on so this time he came

4978
05:37:48,440 --> 05:37:53,400
back and his house was empty and he

4979
05:37:50,240 --> 05:37:57,200
needed some so I went over

4980
05:37:53,400 --> 05:37:57,200
there and drop him a

4981
05:37:59,958 --> 05:38:04,558
box and that's a photo

4982
05:38:07,920 --> 05:38:14,360
I want to close with the slide sanjoy

4983
05:38:11,558 --> 05:38:17,200
sent me an email sometimes ago I I have

4984
05:38:14,360 --> 05:38:18,520
a date here I didn't remember now with

4985
05:38:17,200 --> 05:38:22,440
this

4986
05:38:18,520 --> 05:38:24,718
line but he said you know you got to be

4987
05:38:22,440 --> 05:38:27,798
careful reading this you got to be

4988
05:38:24,718 --> 05:38:29,240
careful reading this he said they forgot

4989
05:38:27,798 --> 05:38:32,478
to tell you

4990
05:38:29,240 --> 05:38:37,920
that the following

4991
05:38:32,478 --> 05:38:40,320
proposition so I wanted to stop here

4992
05:38:37,920 --> 05:38:43,280
basically he's saying that you know you

4993
05:38:40,320 --> 05:38:45,920
got to live forward but you got to look

4994
05:38:43,280 --> 05:38:49,400
back and make the best out of your past

4995
05:38:45,920 --> 05:38:51,760
experience so here it is and one last

4996
05:38:49,400 --> 05:38:54,160
thing before I get off the stage is that

4997
05:38:51,760 --> 05:38:58,878
sanro would ask you questions when you

4998
05:38:54,160 --> 05:39:02,120
go to his his his uh office uh and you

4999
05:38:58,878 --> 05:39:05,478
know he expect some answer and if you

5000
05:39:02,120 --> 05:39:08,040
don't answer he don't ask you again he

5001
05:39:05,478 --> 05:39:11,200
look at you but he look through as if

5002
05:39:08,040 --> 05:39:13,200
he's looking to the infinity through you

5003
05:39:11,200 --> 05:39:15,360
right and it's very

5004
05:39:13,200 --> 05:39:17,638
uncomfortable and so you have to come up

5005
05:39:15,360 --> 05:39:20,240
with the question very quick otherwise

5006
05:39:17,638 --> 05:39:22,120
he look at you through you to the

5007
05:39:20,240 --> 05:39:23,840
infinity and this is a little bit that

5008
05:39:22,120 --> 05:39:25,840
remind me a little bit of that uh

5009
05:39:23,840 --> 05:39:31,080
looking to the Infinity of

5010
05:39:25,840 --> 05:39:31,080
sanjy uh so we will miss him

5011
05:39:31,120 --> 05:39:38,750
[Applause]

5012
05:39:54,760 --> 05:40:00,478
all right uh hello everyone I'm Greg

5013
05:39:57,000 --> 05:40:04,958
warell um delighted to be here and to

5014
05:40:00,478 --> 05:40:07,878
help celebrate San joo's life um uh it

5015
05:40:04,958 --> 05:40:09,840
was just a an hour or so ago that uh

5016
05:40:07,878 --> 05:40:12,360
Leong suggested that maybe I could make

5017
05:40:09,840 --> 05:40:13,760
a few words so I haven't prepared a lot

5018
05:40:12,360 --> 05:40:15,520
but uh I've just collected a little bit

5019
05:40:13,760 --> 05:40:16,360
of my thoughts and I'll try to keep this

5020
05:40:15,520 --> 05:40:20,440
pretty

5021
05:40:16,360 --> 05:40:22,400
short um there's a there's a quote um

5022
05:40:20,440 --> 05:40:25,000
attributed to Frank Lloyd Wright when

5023
05:40:22,400 --> 05:40:27,600
someone observed that he had five grand

5024
05:40:25,000 --> 05:40:30,000
pianos um that said if you take care of

5025
05:40:27,600 --> 05:40:33,840
the luxuries the Necessities take care

5026
05:40:30,000 --> 05:40:36,120
of themselves and I struggled to

5027
05:40:33,840 --> 05:40:39,440
understand that um based on the way I

5028
05:40:36,120 --> 05:40:40,440
grew up but in some ways sanjo helped me

5029
05:40:39,440 --> 05:40:43,718
understand

5030
05:40:40,440 --> 05:40:45,840
that um there's a later quote by uh

5031
05:40:43,718 --> 05:40:49,000
Louie KH that goes great art is not the

5032
05:40:45,840 --> 05:40:51,320
fulfilling of a desire but the making of

5033
05:40:49,000 --> 05:40:53,040
a new desire so the world never needed

5034
05:40:51,320 --> 05:40:55,638
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony until he

5035
05:40:53,040 --> 05:40:56,558
created it um now we couldn't live

5036
05:40:55,638 --> 05:40:59,760
without

5037
05:40:56,558 --> 05:41:02,920
it and uh I feel

5038
05:40:59,760 --> 05:41:05,400
like that was the spirit that that

5039
05:41:02,920 --> 05:41:07,280
sanjoy had in him he understood the

5040
05:41:05,400 --> 05:41:09,760
connection between Art and Science and

5041
05:41:07,280 --> 05:41:13,440
engineering and about creating something

5042
05:41:09,760 --> 05:41:15,760
beautiful um you know he carried that

5043
05:41:13,440 --> 05:41:17,718
into the way he interacted with people

5044
05:41:15,760 --> 05:41:20,160
and the research uh

5045
05:41:17,718 --> 05:41:23,878
agenda and the way he ran Lids you know

5046
05:41:20,160 --> 05:41:26,798
when I arrived in uh 1985 uh he was the

5047
05:41:23,878 --> 05:41:28,360
head of Lids along with Bob and they

5048
05:41:26,798 --> 05:41:30,920
created an extraordinary culture there

5049
05:41:28,360 --> 05:41:33,120
as as people have commented on he he

5050
05:41:30,920 --> 05:41:36,400
brought some remarkable funding to

5051
05:41:33,120 --> 05:41:37,718
campus that it it's it wasn't the size

5052
05:41:36,400 --> 05:41:39,760
of it that was important important it

5053
05:41:37,718 --> 05:41:42,120
was the quality of it it's I've been

5054
05:41:39,760 --> 05:41:44,558
unmatched in its quality and it enabled

5055
05:41:42,120 --> 05:41:47,240
a whole generation of students to pursue

5056
05:41:44,558 --> 05:41:49,638
really beautiful basic research and it

5057
05:41:47,240 --> 05:41:51,760
created a whole community of colleagues

5058
05:41:49,638 --> 05:41:56,558
for me at that time that exists to this

5059
05:41:51,760 --> 05:41:59,600
day and I'm grateful for that um and

5060
05:41:56,558 --> 05:42:02,040
like many of you he he made many trips

5061
05:41:59,600 --> 05:42:04,798
just stopping by the office and asking

5062
05:42:02,040 --> 05:42:07,400
me the same questions he asked you and I

5063
05:42:04,798 --> 05:42:10,160
I appreciate that now even more than I

5064
05:42:07,400 --> 05:42:12,360
did at the time um you know and and he

5065
05:42:10,160 --> 05:42:14,440
he would always kind of make these very

5066
05:42:12,360 --> 05:42:16,520
insightful comments you know he he would

5067
05:42:14,440 --> 05:42:19,280
often talk about computer vision as a

5068
05:42:16,520 --> 05:42:20,920
field and the way they sort of set up

5069
05:42:19,280 --> 05:42:22,958
the foundations of the field you know

5070
05:42:20,920 --> 05:42:24,478
that there are these problems and they

5071
05:42:22,958 --> 05:42:26,680
had this notion that there are a set of

5072
05:42:24,478 --> 05:42:28,160
broad problems not narrow problems broad

5073
05:42:26,680 --> 05:42:30,160
problems that the field should solve and

5074
05:42:28,160 --> 05:42:33,280
he felt like every Community should have

5075
05:42:30,160 --> 05:42:37,680
this notion of a these are our problems

5076
05:42:33,280 --> 05:42:40,000
you know um and and more generally I'd

5077
05:42:37,680 --> 05:42:42,360
say what I appreciate about sanjy is he

5078
05:42:40,000 --> 05:42:44,120
had this kind of quiet confidence I

5079
05:42:42,360 --> 05:42:46,840
always felt like he had nothing to prove

5080
05:42:44,120 --> 05:42:48,878
to anybody never sought the Limelight he

5081
05:42:46,840 --> 05:42:50,920
just wanted to build community and he

5082
05:42:48,878 --> 05:42:52,920
was an exceptionally kind

5083
05:42:50,920 --> 05:42:54,400
individual um at the end of the day I

5084
05:42:52,920 --> 05:42:57,760
think he understood that research was

5085
05:42:54,400 --> 05:43:00,160
really about people and uh you know when

5086
05:42:57,760 --> 05:43:02,360
when he passed away Mitch trod andos

5087
05:43:00,160 --> 05:43:03,638
lapido and I we were all colleagues at

5088
05:43:02,360 --> 05:43:05,400
the same Junior colleagues at the same

5089
05:43:03,638 --> 05:43:07,798
time we swapped a bunch of email and

5090
05:43:05,400 --> 05:43:09,760
what what Mitch wrote was that's very

5091
05:43:07,798 --> 05:43:11,798
sad news not only did he help me a great

5092
05:43:09,760 --> 05:43:15,558
deal early in my career but he was a

5093
05:43:11,798 --> 05:43:18,240
really really nice guy um so in

5094
05:43:15,558 --> 05:43:22,080
conclusion I'll always remember sanjoy

5095
05:43:18,240 --> 05:43:24,040
as um sure he was stoic subtle if I I

5096
05:43:22,080 --> 05:43:25,840
think what it is is he he never his

5097
05:43:24,040 --> 05:43:28,600
highs were never super high and his lows

5098
05:43:25,840 --> 05:43:30,840
were never super low he was just he he

5099
05:43:28,600 --> 05:43:32,680
was he was a man of subtlety and what I

5100
05:43:30,840 --> 05:43:34,600
always remember of think of him as

5101
05:43:32,680 --> 05:43:36,638
always pointing towards the light and

5102
05:43:34,600 --> 05:43:40,550
encouraging us to go there and I hope

5103
05:43:36,638 --> 05:43:46,279
his spirit continues to guide us thank

5104
05:43:40,550 --> 05:43:46,279
[Applause]

5105
05:43:53,840 --> 05:43:59,478
you thank you so much for the beautiful

5106
05:43:57,280 --> 05:44:03,240
remembrances uh we'll start the next

5107
05:43:59,478 --> 05:44:06,120
session in four minutes after um a very

5108
05:44:03,240 --> 05:44:09,120
short break and uh the next session

5109
05:44:06,120 --> 05:44:13,120
we'll have uh Nicola Elia Jeff shama

5110
05:44:09,120 --> 05:44:16,958
leier and BJ chandre to talk about

5111
05:44:13,120 --> 05:44:18,240
sanj's influence on them as a mentor so

5112
05:44:16,958 --> 05:44:21,240
and then after that we'll have a coffee

5113
05:44:18,240 --> 05:44:21,240
break

settings audio settings just to make

5118
05:45:00,760 --> 05:45:05,200
sure it should still remain

5140
05:48:16,440 --> 05:48:20,080
and so please we'll start with uh

5141
05:48:24,558 --> 05:48:31,120
VJ thank you uh could you just load up

5142
05:48:27,958 --> 05:48:33,320
uh my slides please thank

5143
05:48:31,120 --> 05:48:37,478
you

5144
05:48:33,320 --> 05:48:42,798
so um so I uh

5145
05:48:37,478 --> 05:48:47,400
actually uh came to MIT in

5146
05:48:42,798 --> 05:48:52,280
1977 uh to be a PhD student at the O

5147
05:48:47,400 --> 05:48:55,840
Center and um uh my first exposure to

5148
05:48:52,280 --> 05:48:58,600
sanjoy was actually a a bit scary

5149
05:48:55,840 --> 05:49:03,080
because um you know we were I think 11

5150
05:48:58,600 --> 05:49:06,200
PhD students who had come in and uh I

5151
05:49:03,080 --> 05:49:09,878
think uh we considered Deb sarar to be

5152
05:49:06,200 --> 05:49:11,840
one of the bright brightest and uh and

5153
05:49:09,878 --> 05:49:14,400
Deb had actually gone to see

5154
05:49:11,840 --> 05:49:17,718
sanjoy and you know Deb had come from

5155
05:49:14,400 --> 05:49:21,440
Case Western so so you know he knew

5156
05:49:17,718 --> 05:49:25,360
sano's reputation from there and and he

5157
05:49:21,440 --> 05:49:29,400
went in to see sanjoy and uh so sanjo

5158
05:49:25,360 --> 05:49:32,760
asked him probably in Bengali you know

5159
05:49:29,400 --> 05:49:36,080
do you want to work on Theory or or

5160
05:49:32,760 --> 05:49:39,878
applications and Deb said applications

5161
05:49:36,080 --> 05:49:43,680
and he was sh on the door right so so

5162
05:49:39,878 --> 05:49:46,000
you know that was uh that was my uh the

5163
05:49:43,680 --> 05:49:47,520
first exposure but you know I was

5164
05:49:46,000 --> 05:49:50,798
definitely oriented towards

5165
05:49:47,520 --> 05:49:54,878
combinatorial optimization so so I

5166
05:49:50,798 --> 05:50:00,680
didn't have to go through that but I um

5167
05:49:54,878 --> 05:50:04,160
so went on to learn from Tom and uh

5168
05:50:00,680 --> 05:50:08,520
who's here and of course from sanjoy as

5169
05:50:04,160 --> 05:50:11,320
well uh and uh but Lakers and uh you

5170
05:50:08,520 --> 05:50:14,878
know there were lots of great uh of

5171
05:50:11,320 --> 05:50:18,080
course Jerry Shapiro was my PhD advisor

5172
05:50:14,878 --> 05:50:23,240
so lots of people in discreet comori

5173
05:50:18,080 --> 05:50:25,840
optimization so um so and then of course

5174
05:50:23,240 --> 05:50:28,878
I there was a long break and I started

5175
05:50:25,840 --> 05:50:33,280
interacting with sanjo Moore in the '90s

5176
05:50:28,878 --> 05:50:37,000
uh mostly in India I taught at Purdue

5177
05:50:33,280 --> 05:50:40,760
for 10 years from 82 to 92 and then went

5178
05:50:37,000 --> 05:50:44,600
back and uh started meeting sanjoy more

5179
05:50:40,760 --> 05:50:48,718
when I was in India and uh and then uh

5180
05:50:44,600 --> 05:50:53,600
spent a little time visiting Lids uh you

5181
05:50:48,718 --> 05:50:56,558
know in from 2003 onwards but uh

5182
05:50:53,600 --> 05:51:00,478
um part of what I was working on in the

5183
05:50:56,558 --> 05:51:05,320
late 80s and then in the '90s was on

5184
05:51:00,478 --> 05:51:09,200
embeding uh uh theorem proving in

5185
05:51:05,320 --> 05:51:12,320
optimization and uh this was a program

5186
05:51:09,200 --> 05:51:13,400
of research that had been initiated by

5187
05:51:12,320 --> 05:51:17,558
Bob

5188
05:51:13,400 --> 05:51:21,920
juslo uh and uh a few of us sort of

5189
05:51:17,558 --> 05:51:24,840
followed him on that uh unfortunately

5190
05:51:21,920 --> 05:51:29,160
Bob passed away very

5191
05:51:24,840 --> 05:51:31,638
prematurely and so John hooker at Kani

5192
05:51:29,160 --> 05:51:35,360
melon and I sort of picked up the thread

5193
05:51:31,638 --> 05:51:37,200
and we continued the work uh and it

5194
05:51:35,360 --> 05:51:40,360
resulted in a in a

5195
05:51:37,200 --> 05:51:43,320
monograph and uh right towards the end

5196
05:51:40,360 --> 05:51:47,160
of that project which took about 10

5197
05:51:43,320 --> 05:51:51,000
years um I was at lids with uh with

5198
05:51:47,160 --> 05:51:55,840
Vivic borker and uh we were chatting

5199
05:51:51,000 --> 05:51:59,280
with uh with sanjoy and uh and uh there

5200
05:51:55,840 --> 05:52:01,040
was a a problem that was still remaining

5201
05:51:59,280 --> 05:52:03,840
and a chapter of the book that needed to

5202
05:52:01,040 --> 05:52:08,080
be written which was uh could you

5203
05:52:03,840 --> 05:52:12,360
actually embed first out a logic a full

5204
05:52:08,080 --> 05:52:14,958
predicate logic in uh in an

5205
05:52:12,360 --> 05:52:17,400
optimization problem and then what would

5206
05:52:14,958 --> 05:52:21,798
be the insights you could draw from that

5207
05:52:17,400 --> 05:52:25,080
and uh so that led to uh collaboration

5208
05:52:21,798 --> 05:52:27,878
and uh and the paper that you see there

5209
05:52:25,080 --> 05:52:31,760
uh which eventually also became a

5210
05:52:27,878 --> 05:52:34,920
chapter of the book so so that was uh a

5211
05:52:31,760 --> 05:52:37,000
very exciting uh sort of technical

5212
05:52:34,920 --> 05:52:43,080
collaboration that I had

5213
05:52:37,000 --> 05:52:45,200
uh with sanjoy and and VI um and um soon

5214
05:52:43,080 --> 05:52:49,840
after that I think uh there was a

5215
05:52:45,200 --> 05:52:52,400
conference in kin in India that uh that

5216
05:52:49,840 --> 05:52:57,080
sanjo had come for and that a bunch of

5217
05:52:52,400 --> 05:53:02,160
us uh were also at uh I think there was

5218
05:52:57,080 --> 05:53:05,878
uh if I recall Ravi mazunda I think uh

5219
05:53:02,160 --> 05:53:10,160
Balaji praka lots of uh lots of people

5220
05:53:05,878 --> 05:53:14,478
uh whom of course sanjo knew well and um

5221
05:53:10,160 --> 05:53:20,958
and we had a long conversation about

5222
05:53:14,478 --> 05:53:22,478
biology and uh and uh whether physics

5223
05:53:20,958 --> 05:53:25,440
would really solve the problems of

5224
05:53:22,478 --> 05:53:28,400
biology or did you really need computer

5225
05:53:25,440 --> 05:53:32,400
science uh because of the complexity

5226
05:53:28,400 --> 05:53:35,718
involved in biological systems and uh

5227
05:53:32,400 --> 05:53:38,120
and and I think I was convinced that we

5228
05:53:35,718 --> 05:53:41,080
needed computer computer science and uh

5229
05:53:38,120 --> 05:53:45,798
sort of data science uh in a in a strong

5230
05:53:41,080 --> 05:53:49,478
way and uh and actually uh took a pivot

5231
05:53:45,798 --> 05:53:52,400
in my career and I just uh started

5232
05:53:49,478 --> 05:53:55,920
working on this and eventually built a

5233
05:53:52,400 --> 05:53:59,320
company uh which was uh India's first

5234
05:53:55,920 --> 05:54:01,478
sort of uh life science informatics

5235
05:53:59,320 --> 05:54:06,680
companies uh it was called Strand

5236
05:54:01,478 --> 05:54:10,200
genomics and uh and sanjoy uh George and

5237
05:54:06,680 --> 05:54:13,440
several other uh faculty friends

5238
05:54:10,200 --> 05:54:16,798
actually supported us uh as we got the

5239
05:54:13,440 --> 05:54:20,760
company going and um you know and it's

5240
05:54:16,798 --> 05:54:26,000
been a a phenomenal journey and um and I

5241
05:54:20,760 --> 05:54:29,160
think uh um it's um uh so for the

5242
05:54:26,000 --> 05:54:32,080
question to me from sanjoy was not

5243
05:54:29,160 --> 05:54:35,600
what's new but what's new with strand

5244
05:54:32,080 --> 05:54:37,440
right so so I'd keep coming back and

5245
05:54:35,600 --> 05:54:40,520
every time the question would be what's

5246
05:54:37,440 --> 05:54:42,718
new with Strand and um you know I think

5247
05:54:40,520 --> 05:54:45,160
he would be happy to see where the

5248
05:54:42,718 --> 05:54:48,240
company has gone today it's uh it's a

5249
05:54:45,160 --> 05:54:50,718
600 employee company it's uh it's

5250
05:54:48,240 --> 05:54:58,120
actually India's leading uh Precision

5251
05:54:50,718 --> 05:55:01,878
medicine company so um uh just to uh uh

5252
05:54:58,120 --> 05:55:03,520
tell you a little bit uh about uh you

5253
05:55:01,878 --> 05:55:06,320
know his association with the Indian

5254
05:55:03,520 --> 05:55:09,280
Institute of science he was there almost

5255
05:55:06,320 --> 05:55:13,520
almost every year uh you know the month

5256
05:55:09,280 --> 05:55:16,040
of January we could expect uh sanjo to

5257
05:55:13,520 --> 05:55:19,360
to come around and uh there are a whole

5258
05:55:16,040 --> 05:55:21,360
bunch of uh faculty who were associated

5259
05:55:19,360 --> 05:55:23,320
with the Indian Institute of science who

5260
05:55:21,360 --> 05:55:24,360
in One Way or Another worked closely

5261
05:55:23,320 --> 05:55:29,040
with

5262
05:55:24,360 --> 05:55:33,558
Sano and um um and I think uh in

5263
05:55:29,040 --> 05:55:36,320
particular uh Professor narahari who um

5264
05:55:33,558 --> 05:55:37,958
uh ran the game tary lab and was a

5265
05:55:36,320 --> 05:55:38,920
colleague of mine in computer science

5266
05:55:37,958 --> 05:55:42,400
and

5267
05:55:38,920 --> 05:55:46,040
automation actually uh learned a lot

5268
05:55:42,400 --> 05:55:48,240
from sanjoy and uh and you know the this

5269
05:55:46,040 --> 05:55:51,760
other aspect of sanjoy about uh

5270
05:55:48,240 --> 05:55:54,280
institution building leadership I think

5271
05:55:51,760 --> 05:55:57,000
uh you know narahari really sort of

5272
05:55:54,280 --> 05:56:01,080
imbued that and went on to be the dean

5273
05:55:57,000 --> 05:56:04,160
of WCS at uh at the Indian Institute of

5274
05:56:01,080 --> 05:56:06,558
Science and actually uh did remarkably

5275
05:56:04,160 --> 05:56:10,638
well I think he's really sort of built

5276
05:56:06,558 --> 05:56:14,600
that into India's leading sort of WCS

5277
05:56:10,638 --> 05:56:17,638
group um and um so I have two more

5278
05:56:14,600 --> 05:56:20,240
slides which are like messages from

5279
05:56:17,638 --> 05:56:23,400
narahari and another institution Builder

5280
05:56:20,240 --> 05:56:26,440
called spenta vardia whom uh you know

5281
05:56:23,400 --> 05:56:28,760
sanj worked with um I'll leave it to you

5282
05:56:26,440 --> 05:56:32,600
on whether those should be played now or

5283
05:56:28,760 --> 05:56:34,558
later it's okay if you don't mind I'll

5284
05:56:32,600 --> 05:56:37,718
take a couple of minutes and just play

5285
05:56:34,558 --> 05:56:41,000
those this is n

5286
05:56:37,718 --> 05:56:45,400
and um there you

5287
05:56:41,000 --> 05:56:47,558
go hello uh I am narahari from the

5288
05:56:45,400 --> 05:56:50,400
Department of computer science and

5289
05:56:47,558 --> 05:56:53,320
automation uh Indian Institute of

5290
05:56:50,400 --> 05:56:56,320
science um Professor

5291
05:56:53,320 --> 05:57:00,120
mitter was an

5292
05:56:56,320 --> 05:57:02,718
unforgettable Mentor for me since

5293
05:57:00,120 --> 05:57:05,798
1991 in

5294
05:57:02,718 --> 05:57:07,200
1991 as a young assistant professor at

5295
05:57:05,798 --> 05:57:12,440
Ias

5296
05:57:07,200 --> 05:57:14,718
I approached him to host me at Lids MIT

5297
05:57:12,440 --> 05:57:18,280
for a year as a part of the Indo us

5298
05:57:14,718 --> 05:57:23,320
Science and Technology Fellowship he

5299
05:57:18,280 --> 05:57:27,240
readily agreed and uh in 1992 I spent

5300
05:57:23,320 --> 05:57:29,160
almost a year at LS MIT and it was such

5301
05:57:27,240 --> 05:57:33,040
an enriching

5302
05:57:29,160 --> 05:57:36,000
experience among several courses that uh

5303
05:57:33,040 --> 05:57:38,478
uh I was able to do during that Sprint

5304
05:57:36,000 --> 05:57:40,478
uh uh there was this Visionary course

5305
05:57:38,478 --> 05:57:43,040
that was offered by Professor Sanji

5306
05:57:40,478 --> 05:57:45,558
mitter um in collaboration with

5307
05:57:43,040 --> 05:57:49,160
Professor Shankar shastri uh this course

5308
05:57:45,558 --> 05:57:52,360
was called intelligent uh control and it

5309
05:57:49,160 --> 05:57:53,478
opened the doors uh for so many future

5310
05:57:52,360 --> 05:57:56,958
research

5311
05:57:53,478 --> 05:58:01,320
areas I think ever since

5312
05:57:56,958 --> 05:58:05,240
1992 Mentor for me and uh I have had the

5313
05:58:01,320 --> 05:58:06,760
pleasure and privilege of Hosting him uh

5314
05:58:05,240 --> 05:58:09,920
at CSA

5315
05:58:06,760 --> 05:58:13,120
IC uh on the occasion of many multiple

5316
05:58:09,920 --> 05:58:17,958
visits by him and during those visits he

5317
05:58:13,120 --> 05:58:21,958
also gave uh lovely talks I think in his

5318
05:58:17,958 --> 05:58:26,600
passing we have really lost a Doan and a

5319
05:58:21,958 --> 05:58:31,680
legend of uh systems signal processing

5320
05:58:26,600 --> 05:58:33,798
and uh control theory for me personally

5321
05:58:31,680 --> 05:58:37,040
uh I would consider this uh as a very

5322
05:58:33,798 --> 05:58:39,718
deep loss and uh

5323
05:58:37,040 --> 05:58:42,200
uh it is very difficult to forget the

5324
05:58:39,718 --> 05:58:46,000
kind of mentorship that Professor sanjja

5325
05:58:42,200 --> 05:58:48,878
M has provided to me during the past uh

5326
05:58:46,000 --> 05:58:48,878
three three and a half

5327
05:58:50,040 --> 05:58:58,920
decades so those beautiful flame of the

5328
05:58:53,878 --> 05:59:01,000
forest uh you know flowers and and the

5329
05:58:58,920 --> 05:59:04,718
Indian Institute of science Tower are

5330
05:59:01,000 --> 05:59:07,000
sort of iconic um for those of you who

5331
05:59:04,718 --> 05:59:12,120
have haven't visited the campus please

5332
05:59:07,000 --> 05:59:15,878
do it's a 400 Acres of you know wooded

5333
05:59:12,120 --> 05:59:20,200
and wonderful Gardens so

5334
05:59:15,878 --> 05:59:23,400
um now spenta varia um is a string

5335
05:59:20,200 --> 05:59:24,798
theorist uh and he was building this

5336
05:59:23,400 --> 05:59:26,878
brand new

5337
05:59:24,798 --> 05:59:29,200
institution uh called The International

5338
05:59:26,878 --> 05:59:33,080
Center for theoretical Sciences in

5339
05:59:29,200 --> 05:59:37,320
Bangalore and again I think sanjoy was

5340
05:59:33,080 --> 05:59:40,440
uh an advisor and a mentor uh and here's

5341
05:59:37,320 --> 05:59:41,920
Penta Sanjay was deeply interested in

5342
05:59:40,440 --> 05:59:45,718
the development of scientific

5343
05:59:41,920 --> 05:59:47,638
institutions in India and he visited the

5344
05:59:45,718 --> 05:59:51,478
International Center for theoretical

5345
05:59:47,638 --> 05:59:55,520
Sciences of tifr in Bangalore regularly

5346
05:59:51,478 --> 05:59:58,200
for almost a decade as a faculty

5347
05:59:55,520 --> 06:00:00,958
associate during each visit he would

5348
05:59:58,200 --> 06:00:03,280
focus on a specific area like

5349
06:00:00,958 --> 06:00:06,798
Neuroscience nonlinear filtering and

5350
06:00:03,280 --> 06:00:09,558
data assimilation Network science

5351
06:00:06,798 --> 06:00:11,558
Etc I still remember a small conference

5352
06:00:09,558 --> 06:00:14,680
he had organized in

5353
06:00:11,558 --> 06:00:17,958
2012 in which he lectured on John Fon

5354
06:00:14,680 --> 06:00:19,440
Norman's ideas on the architecture of

5355
06:00:17,958 --> 06:00:22,840
the

5356
06:00:19,440 --> 06:00:25,760
brain his vision of the unity of Applied

5357
06:00:22,840 --> 06:00:29,040
Mathematics probability stochastic

5358
06:00:25,760 --> 06:00:31,920
analysis and computer science influenced

5359
06:00:29,040 --> 06:00:34,958
the areas to grow at icts and its

5360
06:00:31,920 --> 06:00:36,478
initial faculty hiring that included

5361
06:00:34,958 --> 06:00:40,760
people like Amita

5362
06:00:36,478 --> 06:00:44,440
Vishal Vasan and saram ambas Saran these

5363
06:00:40,760 --> 06:00:47,840
teams continue to grow strongly at

5364
06:00:44,440 --> 06:00:50,320
icts Sanjay was a deep researcher a

5365
06:00:47,840 --> 06:00:52,958
gentle and kind individual who

5366
06:00:50,320 --> 06:00:57,400
contributed greatly to icds and his

5367
06:00:52,958 --> 06:00:57,400
faculty he will be greatly

5368
06:00:57,558 --> 06:01:02,878
missed yes um he will be greatly missed

5369
06:01:00,680 --> 06:01:06,520
I think he was almost a family member I

5370
06:01:02,878 --> 06:01:11,080
think uh uh so for both my wife

5371
06:01:06,520 --> 06:01:16,320
and me and um and also our daughter Maya

5372
06:01:11,080 --> 06:01:18,920
who was in mi undergrad and so he's uh

5373
06:01:16,320 --> 06:01:22,240
you know we will miss him but uh I think

5374
06:01:18,920 --> 06:01:25,550
we'll also have very fond memories of uh

5375
06:01:22,240 --> 06:01:30,550
of his great contributions thank

5376
06:01:25,550 --> 06:01:30,550
[Applause]

5377
06:01:33,760 --> 06:01:38,520
you it's uh the last session and a lot

5378
06:01:36,958 --> 06:01:42,160
of things good things have been said

5379
06:01:38,520 --> 06:01:46,160
about s Joy it's difficult not to repeat

5380
06:01:42,160 --> 06:01:49,520
several of the good adjectives for S Joy

5381
06:01:46,160 --> 06:01:52,878
but I'll try to put this uh this little

5382
06:01:49,520 --> 06:01:57,280
talk in a in a very personal

5383
06:01:52,878 --> 06:02:00,638
context um contrary to many of you which

5384
06:01:57,280 --> 06:02:03,320
met s Joy after being get got into

5385
06:02:00,638 --> 06:02:06,958
graduate school or doing PhD or postdoc

5386
06:02:03,320 --> 06:02:10,558
and so on I was an engineer at Fiat in

5387
06:02:06,958 --> 06:02:13,320
Italy and I wanted to just take one year

5388
06:02:10,558 --> 06:02:16,440
to learn about control and I didn't know

5389
06:02:13,320 --> 06:02:19,360
I was going to meet and Joy or I didn't

5390
06:02:16,440 --> 06:02:19,360
know anything about

5391
06:02:19,680 --> 06:02:23,600
him and uh

5392
06:02:24,718 --> 06:02:30,440
sorry and

5393
06:02:27,478 --> 06:02:33,638
uh and so I didn't know who he was to

5394
06:02:30,440 --> 06:02:35,680
such a giant of the field right and uh

5395
06:02:33,638 --> 06:02:38,478
and uh I was very naive and and this is

5396
06:02:35,680 --> 06:02:41,600
the the story that took me about meting

5397
06:02:38,478 --> 06:02:44,160
him the first time and I apologize for

5398
06:02:41,600 --> 06:02:47,520
certain parts that could be uh a little

5399
06:02:44,160 --> 06:02:48,520
bit naive or or or Politically Incorrect

5400
06:02:47,520 --> 06:02:52,558
at this

5401
06:02:48,520 --> 06:02:55,600
time so I needed some money to go at M

5402
06:02:52,558 --> 06:02:59,400
and I needed a signature from Professor

5403
06:02:55,600 --> 06:03:02,638
mitter about the fellowship in Italy and

5404
06:02:59,400 --> 06:03:04,478
so I call leads and they they say oh

5405
06:03:02,638 --> 06:03:06,320
Professor mitter is not here Professor

5406
06:03:04,478 --> 06:03:07,200
but I'm calling from Italy keep in mind

5407
06:03:06,320 --> 06:03:11,280
this is

5408
06:03:07,200 --> 06:03:15,400
89 there is no there is no cell phone

5409
06:03:11,280 --> 06:03:19,160
there is no credit card there is no uh

5410
06:03:15,400 --> 06:03:21,878
email and uh and so I said

5411
06:03:19,160 --> 06:03:23,920
okay but but you're lucky I keep calling

5412
06:03:21,878 --> 06:03:26,200
leads and they say hey you're lucky

5413
06:03:23,920 --> 06:03:28,798
Professor MIT is in Italy I said oh I'm

5414
06:03:26,200 --> 06:03:31,160
Italian so I I'm going to I'm going to

5415
06:03:28,798 --> 06:03:33,760
get him give me the phone so so give me

5416
06:03:31,160 --> 06:03:36,840
Adriana's phone in Florence personal

5417
06:03:33,760 --> 06:03:38,400
phone well house phone

5418
06:03:36,840 --> 06:03:42,080
and

5419
06:03:38,400 --> 06:03:43,958
uh so I start calling from every place

5420
06:03:42,080 --> 06:03:47,280
because the deadline for presenting the

5421
06:03:43,958 --> 06:03:49,920
the the fellowship you know the the form

5422
06:03:47,280 --> 06:03:52,840

06:06:48,320 --> 06:06:55,040
case of any inconvenience or so and so I

5490
06:06:52,000 --> 06:06:56,760
had a a very Pro I say what is possible

5491
06:06:55,040 --> 06:06:58,798
the only possibility is that I left the

5492
06:06:56,760 --> 06:07:01,478
wallet in the in the phone

5493
06:06:58,798 --> 06:07:03,400
Boot and so I had a very big question

5494
06:07:01,478 --> 06:07:06,840
now I said do I continue without driving

5495
06:07:03,400 --> 06:07:10,160
license and go to Rome or I go back back

5496
06:07:06,840 --> 06:07:13,280
I call I go back we decided to go back

5497
06:07:10,160 --> 06:07:14,920
and and the SEC and then the secretary

5498
06:07:13,280 --> 06:07:18,280
the students found this wallet with

5499
06:07:14,920 --> 06:07:20,520
$1,000 in it at the time equivalent

5500
06:07:18,280 --> 06:07:22,558
money they gave it to the secretaries

5501
06:07:20,520 --> 06:07:25,558
the secretary gave it to San Joy M say

5502
06:07:22,558 --> 06:07:25,558
listen this guy lost

5503
06:07:26,680 --> 06:07:32,798
$1,000 and and and uh and and uh and

5504
06:07:31,240 --> 06:07:34,798
then when I went back the secretaries

5505
06:07:32,798 --> 06:07:36,400
were all happy they came back and S Jo

5506
06:07:34,798 --> 06:07:41,320
was there he didn't say

5507
06:07:36,400 --> 06:07:43,120
anything but but uh uh but he had this

5508
06:07:41,320 --> 06:07:45,958
mark on his face right and then I

5509
06:07:43,120 --> 06:07:48,280
learned to recognize in the future right

5510
06:07:45,958 --> 06:07:50,120
and and and a sparkle in his eyes and

5511
06:07:48,280 --> 06:07:52,400
and I say I'm sorry I'm sorry thank you

5512
06:07:50,120 --> 06:07:54,920
I left to go went to Rome and gave this

5513
06:07:52,400 --> 06:07:57,440
thing 10 minutes before the

5514
06:07:54,920 --> 06:07:59,120
deadline

5515
06:07:57,440 --> 06:08:02,120
uh

5516
06:07:59,120 --> 06:08:02,120
yes

5517
06:08:02,840 --> 06:08:09,680
no I didn't get the fellowship and and

5518
06:08:06,798 --> 06:08:12,240
and and I thought I destroy my

5519
06:08:09,680 --> 06:08:15,520
relationship with this guy I mean

5520
06:08:12,240 --> 06:08:17,958
that's but but uh but in reality he

5521
06:08:15,520 --> 06:08:20,558
became my my guardian angel from there

5522
06:08:17,958 --> 06:08:23,638
own he felt I think he felt this guy

5523
06:08:20,558 --> 06:08:23,638
needs a lot serious

5524
06:08:24,920 --> 06:08:29,760
supervision and and and he gave me into

5525
06:08:27,520 --> 06:08:32,638
the hands when I got to MIT to the to

5526
06:08:29,760 --> 06:08:35,120
the capable ends of muner I was a

5527
06:08:32,638 --> 06:08:36,680
student eventually I became a PhD

5528
06:08:35,120 --> 06:08:39,280
student student and I

5529
06:08:36,680 --> 06:08:41,240
graduated and that's then officially

5530
06:08:39,280 --> 06:08:42,798
sanjoy was always behind the scene as

5531
06:08:41,240 --> 06:08:47,240
everybody has said in this in this

5532
06:08:42,798 --> 06:08:49,638
conference but after my PhD I I I

5533
06:08:47,240 --> 06:08:52,360
started a postdoc and this time I was

5534
06:08:49,638 --> 06:08:55,798
postdoc with s Joy

5535
06:08:52,360 --> 06:08:57,520
M and during the years we staying with

5536
06:08:55,798 --> 06:08:59,400
the other students I would I would

5537
06:08:57,520 --> 06:09:03,478
experience some of the lectures that

5538
06:08:59,400 --> 06:09:08,000
andjoy M would give on on quantum theory

5539
06:09:03,478 --> 06:09:11,040
quantum physics or or or or or what's or

5540
06:09:08,000 --> 06:09:12,958
um statistical mechanics and of course

5541
06:09:11,040 --> 06:09:16,478
we were having these lectures in a very

5542
06:09:12,958 --> 06:09:19,440
small room on building 35 and of and of

5543
06:09:16,478 --> 06:09:20,958
course everybody was lost but then then

5544
06:09:19,440 --> 06:09:23,160
there is a there is a question that

5545
06:09:20,958 --> 06:09:24,638
comes right I need to ask a good

5546
06:09:23,160 --> 06:09:27,920
question I need to ask a good question

5547
06:09:24,638 --> 06:09:30,718
it's kind of sort of panic that you have

5548
06:09:27,920 --> 06:09:33,558
when you are now in the presence of of S

5549
06:09:30,718 --> 06:09:34,760
Joy right when whenever is is is asking

5550
06:09:33,558 --> 06:09:38,000
you question you have to have a good

5551
06:09:34,760 --> 06:09:42,040
answer somebody was repeating saying

5552
06:09:38,000 --> 06:09:45,000
before and so and so when when Ali asked

5553
06:09:42,040 --> 06:09:48,120
me to to to to to say something about

5554
06:09:45,000 --> 06:09:50,878
influence as a mentor I said I need to

5555
06:09:48,120 --> 06:09:53,920
say something deep for some

5556
06:09:50,878 --> 06:09:56,718
joy and and

5557
06:09:53,920 --> 06:09:58,600
uh then I remember these stories right

5558
06:09:56,718 --> 06:10:01,160
that you have to say something it felt

5559
06:09:58,600 --> 06:10:04,120
like you have to impress him you have to

5560
06:10:01,160 --> 06:10:06,360
at least I did impress him say something

5561
06:10:04,120 --> 06:10:09,080
smart say something good

5562
06:10:06,360 --> 06:10:13,280
and to my surprise when I start working

5563
06:10:09,080 --> 06:10:15,718
with him the reaction that I got is that

5564
06:10:13,280 --> 06:10:18,400
almost not almost everything I said

5565
06:10:15,718 --> 06:10:22,958
discussion but he will conclude his his

5566
06:10:18,400 --> 06:10:24,478
his his his story this meeting saying

5567
06:10:22,958 --> 06:10:27,558
that's interesting let's talk some more

5568
06:10:24,478 --> 06:10:29,718
about this and that gave me a tremendous

5569
06:10:27,558 --> 06:10:31,760
confidence because I said is Joy likes

5570
06:10:29,718 --> 06:10:34,200
it I don't care about anything else I

5571
06:10:31,760 --> 06:10:37,240
think it's good and gave me a lot of

5572
06:10:34,200 --> 06:10:39,920
confidence in trying to think like he

5573
06:10:37,240 --> 06:10:42,958
does or mimicking little mimicking of

5574
06:10:39,920 --> 06:10:46,160
what he did in trying to be more open

5575
06:10:42,958 --> 06:10:50,000
more more embracing of different way of

5576
06:10:46,160 --> 06:10:52,600
approaching a problem and most of it uh

5577
06:10:50,000 --> 06:10:55,680
learn to ask the good questions and

5578
06:10:52,600 --> 06:10:57,760
those has driven me for all these years

5579
06:10:55,680 --> 06:11:01,160
and of course andjoy has been always

5580
06:10:57,760 --> 06:11:05,080
part of of my life since then my kids

5581
06:11:01,160 --> 06:11:07,600
are here because is because of s joy and

5582
06:11:05,080 --> 06:11:09,600
and and and was been always being in

5583
06:11:07,600 --> 06:11:12,558
contact and asking how the family and

5584
06:11:09,600 --> 06:11:14,798
how the theory and what's going on so

5585
06:11:12,558 --> 06:11:18,478
I'll thank you s jooy I don't know if I

5586
06:11:14,798 --> 06:11:20,120
if I made a deep point but the fact that

5587
06:11:18,478 --> 06:11:24,600
you

5588
06:11:20,120 --> 06:11:26,280
were encouraging me with this let's talk

5589
06:11:24,600 --> 06:11:28,600
more this is

5590
06:11:26,280 --> 06:11:30,798
interesting I find that there has been

5591
06:11:28,600 --> 06:11:33,638
very empowering for me the fact that you

5592
06:11:30,798 --> 06:11:36,030
like the stuff I was thinking and so I

5593
06:11:33,638 --> 06:11:42,320
conclude here thank you

5594
06:11:36,030 --> 06:11:42,320
[Applause]

5595
06:11:52,520 --> 06:11:55,638
this feels like a gathering of a very

5596
06:11:54,320 --> 06:11:59,680
important

5597
06:11:55,638 --> 06:12:03,760
tribe who all of us are fortunate to

5598
06:11:59,680 --> 06:12:05,958
call San Joy our intellectual and

5599
06:12:03,760 --> 06:12:09,200
spiritual leader

5600
06:12:05,958 --> 06:12:13,280
um a lot have been said throughout the

5601
06:12:09,200 --> 06:12:16,400
day about all facets of of San Joy being

5602
06:12:13,280 --> 06:12:21,160
a great scholar a mentor a

5603
06:12:16,400 --> 06:12:26,160
teacher um I I could hardly do anything

5604
06:12:21,160 --> 06:12:29,000
better than that um perhaps I

5605
06:12:26,160 --> 06:12:31,520
thought um I could just talk a little

5606
06:12:29,000 --> 06:12:35,200
bit about a particular problem that has

5607
06:12:31,520 --> 06:12:37,520
been largely inspired by S joy and

5608
06:12:35,200 --> 06:12:39,958
perhaps to a small degree uh

5609
06:12:37,520 --> 06:12:42,120
contextualize a lot of things that

5610
06:12:39,958 --> 06:12:45,120
everybody has talked about so my

5611
06:12:42,120 --> 06:12:48,360
association with s Joy U started during

5612
06:12:45,120 --> 06:12:52,040
his Golden Years uh from

5613
06:12:48,360 --> 06:12:55,680
2018 uh onwards um starting out as a

5614
06:12:52,040 --> 06:12:58,840
lead um visiting scholar and later on

5615
06:12:55,680 --> 06:13:02,120
carried on through many long walks

5616
06:12:58,840 --> 06:13:03,000
across the Charles River and late night

5617
06:13:02,120 --> 06:13:06,920
phone

5618
06:13:03,000 --> 06:13:09,400
calls um and many thing that we talked

5619
06:13:06,920 --> 06:13:11,958
about have already been talked about

5620
06:13:09,400 --> 06:13:13,440
here Jose mentioned about his

5621
06:13:11,958 --> 06:13:16,638
fascination with

5622
06:13:13,440 --> 06:13:19,040
AI um Aria mentioned about her his

5623
06:13:16,638 --> 06:13:22,520
earlier association with the field of of

5624
06:13:19,040 --> 06:13:25,878
Power Systems and almost everybody

5625
06:13:22,520 --> 06:13:28,520
talked about his deep commitment of

5626
06:13:25,878 --> 06:13:31,240
abstraction and seeing through the

5627
06:13:28,520 --> 06:13:32,600
things the connection between seemingly

5628
06:13:31,240 --> 06:13:36,160
diverse

5629
06:13:32,600 --> 06:13:38,320
Fields um this is sort of a largely

5630
06:13:36,160 --> 06:13:40,878
inspired by by by this by these

5631
06:13:38,320 --> 06:13:44,840
qualities that San Joy uh passed on to

5632
06:13:40,878 --> 06:13:47,400
us so I'm going to talk about um

5633
06:13:44,840 --> 06:13:49,478
something started out by really you know

5634
06:13:47,400 --> 06:13:51,280
from Rachel's email so Rachel has been

5635
06:13:49,478 --> 06:13:52,958
always the reliable messenger every time

5636
06:13:51,280 --> 06:13:55,718
you know s Joy had something to deliver

5637
06:13:52,958 --> 06:13:57,320
he would say Rachel send this to to and

5638
06:13:55,718 --> 06:13:59,798
and this is one of the lecture notes I

5639
06:13:57,320 --> 06:14:01,558
got from Rachel it's about architectural

5640
06:13:59,798 --> 06:14:06,200
thing I think architecture is something

5641
06:14:01,558 --> 06:14:08,040
s Joo is deeply deeply U interested in

5642
06:14:06,200 --> 06:14:10,600
and this is his quote is the

5643
06:14:08,040 --> 06:14:13,200
organization of distributed algorithms

5644
06:14:10,600 --> 06:14:16,840
in hardware and software for performing

5645
06:14:13,200 --> 06:14:18,080
complex heterogeneous functions um I

5646
06:14:16,840 --> 06:14:21,958
think throughout the years has been

5647
06:14:18,080 --> 06:14:23,400
always been um having a this deep quest

5648
06:14:21,958 --> 06:14:25,920
of of what is the underlying

5649
06:14:23,400 --> 06:14:29,240
architecture of complex systems and

5650
06:14:25,920 --> 06:14:31,080
architecture is is enabling uh

5651
06:14:29,240 --> 06:14:33,040
conceptual underpinning of a lot of

5652
06:14:31,080 --> 06:14:35,320
success on the technological sense like

5653
06:14:33,040 --> 06:14:37,000
the success of the internet or perhaps

5654
06:14:35,320 --> 06:14:39,840
more recently the proliferation of

5655
06:14:37,000 --> 06:14:43,080
decentralized trust and cryptocurrencies

5656
06:14:39,840 --> 06:14:45,000
right um we did a little bit of attempt

5657
06:14:43,080 --> 06:14:47,200
I was fortunate to be co-authoring a

5658
06:14:45,000 --> 06:14:49,920
couple papers during those golden years

5659
06:14:47,200 --> 06:14:52,040
of St Joyce times um one of them was

5660
06:14:49,920 --> 06:14:54,080
sort of attempt to think about what

5661
06:14:52,040 --> 06:14:55,920
exactly should be the architecture

5662
06:14:54,080 --> 06:14:59,558
moving forward for the sort of a new

5663
06:14:55,920 --> 06:15:01,520
Energy Power Systems um I don't declare

5664
06:14:59,558 --> 06:15:05,718
success but this is sort of just an

5665
06:15:01,520 --> 06:15:08,040
attempt but at the he at High of it it

5666
06:15:05,718 --> 06:15:09,558
it's the the top layer the top layer

5667
06:15:08,040 --> 06:15:11,280
that many of you mentioned about Sano

5668
06:15:09,558 --> 06:15:13,798
being a humanist I think the top layer

5669
06:15:11,280 --> 06:15:15,920
was largely instilled by him saying that

5670
06:15:13,798 --> 06:15:17,718
a lot of these complex systems evolves

5671
06:15:15,920 --> 06:15:21,080
not only on technological reasons but

5672
06:15:17,718 --> 06:15:23,320
also on societal choices we as a humans

5673
06:15:21,080 --> 06:15:24,920
we decided to choose to combat the

5674
06:15:23,320 --> 06:15:26,638
climate change it was not a

5675
06:15:24,920 --> 06:15:30,878
technological reason but it was a

5676
06:15:26,638 --> 06:15:32,200
societal choice so how does that affect

5677
06:15:30,878 --> 06:15:33,558
then the evolution of complex

5678
06:15:32,200 --> 06:15:36,920
Engineering

5679
06:15:33,558 --> 06:15:36,920
Systems um

5680
06:15:37,080 --> 06:15:43,040
so we kind of wrote A Few papers

5681
06:15:39,360 --> 06:15:44,760
together in the 2021 time we were

5682
06:15:43,040 --> 06:15:46,280
thinking about this whole vehicle being

5683
06:15:44,760 --> 06:15:49,718
electrified is going to give a lot of

5684
06:15:46,280 --> 06:15:52,200
trouble to the power grid um then later

5685
06:15:49,718 --> 06:15:55,320
on more recent years the proliferation

5686
06:15:52,200 --> 06:15:58,200
of computing and Ai and cryptocurrency

5687
06:15:55,320 --> 06:15:59,958
has ADD on a lot more energy to the grid

5688
06:15:58,200 --> 06:16:02,000
and that becomes even more challenged

5689
06:15:59,958 --> 06:16:04,120
though we wrote some articles about why

5690
06:16:02,000 --> 06:16:05,520
the Grid or perhaps more broadly

5691
06:16:04,120 --> 06:16:07,878
speaking why infrastru structure matter

5692
06:16:05,520 --> 06:16:10,400
in these whole climate change

5693
06:16:07,878 --> 06:16:15,638
discussions and this is sort of a very

5694
06:16:10,400 --> 06:16:19,798
new paper about that and

5695
06:16:15,638 --> 06:16:22,000
uh but the it really was started from

5696
06:16:19,798 --> 06:16:23,600
from San Joy just keep asking me what is

5697
06:16:22,000 --> 06:16:25,080
the architecture of power system what is

5698
06:16:23,600 --> 06:16:28,920
the architecture of Power

5699
06:16:25,080 --> 06:16:31,600
Systems and uh um I think this is sort

5700
06:16:28,920 --> 06:16:33,040
of a an area where this particular tribe

5701
06:16:31,600 --> 06:16:36,000
actually will have a lot to do and a lot

5702
06:16:33,040 --> 06:16:40,638
to contribute to I just give you one

5703
06:16:36,000 --> 06:16:42,080
data point um you know everybody here

5704
06:16:40,638 --> 06:16:44,160
knows a lot more electricity will be

5705
06:16:42,080 --> 06:16:46,920
consumed in the US in particular in in

5706
06:16:44,160 --> 06:16:49,080
the context of electrifying the cars and

5707
06:16:46,920 --> 06:16:52,280
trucks and also all the Computing

5708
06:16:49,080 --> 06:16:55,478
demands but I really was took kind of a

5709
06:16:52,280 --> 06:16:57,240
bit of a surprise to see that um if you

5710
06:16:55,478 --> 06:17:00,160
think about electrifying Americans cars

5711
06:16:57,240 --> 06:17:02,600
and trucks that's a lot of electricity

5712
06:17:00,160 --> 06:17:05,240
but there even more electricity on on

5713
06:17:02,600 --> 06:17:07,360
thinking about the Computing um energy

5714
06:17:05,240 --> 06:17:10,760
demand and it's not even a one:1 ratio

5715
06:17:07,360 --> 06:17:12,638
it's more like a 1: five ratio so being

5716
06:17:10,760 --> 06:17:14,840
being a humanist being San joy as a

5717
06:17:12,638 --> 06:17:16,600
humanist he cares a lot about the the

5718
06:17:14,840 --> 06:17:17,958
human society's biggest challenges if

5719
06:17:16,600 --> 06:17:20,120
you ask around what are the biggest

5720
06:17:17,958 --> 06:17:21,440
societal challenges of human society I

5721
06:17:20,120 --> 06:17:22,958
think many of you would probably agree

5722
06:17:21,440 --> 06:17:24,478
with me that two of the biggest societal

5723
06:17:22,958 --> 06:17:26,478
challenges out there number one is how

5724
06:17:24,478 --> 06:17:27,878
do we combat climate change and number

5725
06:17:26,478 --> 06:17:31,600
two is how do we harness the potential

5726
06:17:27,878 --> 06:17:33,840
of AI little did we realize little did I

5727
06:17:31,600 --> 06:17:36,240
realize there's a common

5728
06:17:33,840 --> 06:17:38,160
bottleneck that common bottleneck is in

5729
06:17:36,240 --> 06:17:41,440
the manifestation of the electric grid

5730
06:17:38,160 --> 06:17:41,440
in the US is just not ready for

5731
06:17:43,040 --> 06:17:48,440
both there's a full stack research ahead

5732
06:17:45,958 --> 06:17:51,400
of us this tribe can make a lot of

5733
06:17:48,440 --> 06:17:53,520
impact on this particular uh full stack

5734
06:17:51,400 --> 06:17:56,718
research agenda all the way from new

5735
06:17:53,520 --> 06:17:59,200
materials to energy efficient Computing

5736
06:17:56,718 --> 06:18:01,798
to networks and Power Systems to you

5737
06:17:59,200 --> 06:18:05,638
know including climate models and and

5738
06:18:01,798 --> 06:18:07,638
and optimization and the past 15 years I

5739
06:18:05,638 --> 06:18:09,200
was living in Texas and just on my

5740
06:18:07,638 --> 06:18:12,160
backyard something was just happening

5741
06:18:09,200 --> 06:18:14,240
which was this uh cryptocurrency mining

5742
06:18:12,160 --> 06:18:16,160
So 20% of the worldwide Bitcoin mining

5743
06:18:14,240 --> 06:18:18,080
was was in the state of Texas so we were

5744
06:18:16,160 --> 06:18:20,160
sort of a ground zero on seeing some of

5745
06:18:18,080 --> 06:18:22,040
these challenges so we saw firsthand

5746
06:18:20,160 --> 06:18:24,360
about this tremendous amount of

5747
06:18:22,040 --> 06:18:27,320
electricity consumption happening in in

5748
06:18:24,360 --> 06:18:29,920
the in the crypto area and you know

5749
06:18:27,320 --> 06:18:31,600
largely you know San Joy thinking has

5750
06:18:29,920 --> 06:18:34,920
inspired us to think about what what can

5751
06:18:31,600 --> 06:18:39,280
we harness this Computing demand for the

5752
06:18:34,920 --> 06:18:41,280
for the use of of grid purposes um and

5753
06:18:39,280 --> 06:18:43,080
and this sort of something we have been

5754
06:18:41,280 --> 06:18:44,280
doing over the past few years about

5755
06:18:43,080 --> 06:18:46,200
thinking about what is the role of a

5756
06:18:44,280 --> 06:18:47,798
university in thinking about these

5757
06:18:46,200 --> 06:18:49,200
issues of blockchain and Computing and

5758
06:18:47,798 --> 06:18:51,360
the implication on energy and

5759
06:18:49,200 --> 06:18:53,718
environment I think a huge role for the

5760
06:18:51,360 --> 06:18:56,320
University Pro in in play to in

5761
06:18:53,718 --> 06:19:01,240
education research public perception and

5762
06:18:56,320 --> 06:19:03,520
policymaking um and uh you know I'll

5763
06:19:01,240 --> 06:19:06,120
just show you this just the scale of the

5764
06:19:03,520 --> 06:19:08,520
problem a little bit if if the video

5765
06:19:06,120 --> 06:19:11,798
comes

5766
06:19:08,520 --> 06:19:13,760
um this is a 700 megawatt uh Bitcoin

5767
06:19:11,798 --> 06:19:16,000
mining facility 50 minutes away from

5768
06:19:13,760 --> 06:19:19,558
where my house was and is the world's

5769
06:19:16,000 --> 06:19:22,200
largest Bitcoin mining facility and it's

5770
06:19:19,558 --> 06:19:24,760
um it's it's consuming as much of

5771
06:19:22,200 --> 06:19:26,920
electricity in this Cham seven Chambers

5772
06:19:24,760 --> 06:19:30,840
as as as the entire city of Cambridge

5773
06:19:26,920 --> 06:19:32,760
right so um and uh This was done just in

5774
06:19:30,840 --> 06:19:35,600
18 months it's just set up during the co

5775
06:19:32,760 --> 06:19:37,840
time and uh so so so I mean we're

5776
06:19:35,600 --> 06:19:39,920
talking about big scale changes on on

5777
06:19:37,840 --> 06:19:43,200
the electric grid big

5778
06:19:39,920 --> 06:19:44,878
scale and uh you know we then sort of

5779
06:19:43,200 --> 06:19:46,760
think about what can you actually do for

5780
06:19:44,878 --> 06:19:48,600
the grid and so there is something

5781
06:19:46,760 --> 06:19:51,240
interesting about you can harness them

5782
06:19:48,600 --> 06:19:54,040
for for flexibility purposes and so on

5783
06:19:51,240 --> 06:19:56,320
um but the the mindboggling part is that

5784
06:19:54,040 --> 06:19:58,040
you look at their financial reports they

5785
06:19:56,320 --> 06:19:59,400
ended up making more money in the energy

5786
06:19:58,040 --> 06:20:01,360
Market than they make money out of the

5787
06:19:59,400 --> 06:20:07,680
selling the Bitcoins

5788
06:20:01,360 --> 06:20:09,400
so uh again um just my modeling and uh

5789
06:20:07,680 --> 06:20:11,520
and then on the other hand there's also

5790
06:20:09,400 --> 06:20:12,878
a lot of watershed moments for for how

5791
06:20:11,520 --> 06:20:14,760
can we harness the latest and the

5792
06:20:12,878 --> 06:20:17,440
greatest AI for the energy system in

5793
06:20:14,760 --> 06:20:20,120
itself so it's energy for AI but also AI

5794
06:20:17,440 --> 06:20:23,320
for energy and that again is largely

5795
06:20:20,120 --> 06:20:24,798
inspired by by San Joy's um um remarks

5796
06:20:23,320 --> 06:20:26,840
to me about thinking about these

5797
06:20:24,798 --> 06:20:29,920
architectural issues and trying to

5798
06:20:26,840 --> 06:20:32,400
figure out the can do and cannot do of

5799
06:20:29,920 --> 06:20:38,160
the state of the AI for a particular

5800
06:20:32,400 --> 06:20:42,160
area that dear to my heart and uh um so

5801
06:20:38,160 --> 06:20:44,558
I think on both ends power to Ai and AI

5802
06:20:42,160 --> 06:20:46,798
to power there's a large role that

5803
06:20:44,558 --> 06:20:49,760
fundamental deep thinking architectural

5804
06:20:46,798 --> 06:20:52,760
thinking is going to make a very

5805
06:20:49,760 --> 06:20:55,040
important impact and and sanjoy keeps

5806
06:20:52,760 --> 06:20:56,840
inspiring us to to think about that

5807
06:20:55,040 --> 06:20:59,440
along those ways and and leading that

5808
06:20:56,840 --> 06:21:02,400
way of transition today is also a very

5809
06:20:59,440 --> 06:21:04,680
special day today is the mid- autumn day

5810
06:21:02,400 --> 06:21:07,400
so for all the Oriental culture this is

5811
06:21:04,680 --> 06:21:09,558
the day where we celebrate a lot this is

5812
06:21:07,400 --> 06:21:11,400
the day when the moon is the brightest

5813
06:21:09,558 --> 06:21:14,638
and the roundest and the

5814
06:21:11,400 --> 06:21:16,920
biggest so tonight when we watch the

5815
06:21:14,638 --> 06:21:19,958
moon maybe some of you were enjoying

5816
06:21:16,920 --> 06:21:23,000
some moon cakes I know that San Joy will

5817
06:21:19,958 --> 06:21:25,990
be looking down to us with a lot of

5818
06:21:23,000 --> 06:21:32,209
smile and love thank you

5819
06:21:25,990 --> 06:21:32,209
[Applause]

5820
06:21:35,558 --> 06:21:40,558
so for some closing thoughts on on the

5821
06:21:38,240 --> 06:21:43,400
panel I uh you know this was supposed to

5822
06:21:40,558 --> 06:21:44,798
be a non-technical symposium and it

5823
06:21:43,400 --> 06:21:47,320
largely has been but there's been an

5824
06:21:44,798 --> 06:21:49,920
underlying mathematical theme uh

5825
06:21:47,320 --> 06:21:53,280
throughout the day in that uh we've

5826
06:21:49,920 --> 06:21:57,160
talked about sanjoy uh as the uh the

5827
06:21:53,280 --> 06:22:01,120
mentor the the the adviser The Scholar

5828
06:21:57,160 --> 06:22:04,680
the humanist the specialist in coding

5829
06:22:01,120 --> 06:22:07,080
controls uh biology computation and and

5830
06:22:04,680 --> 06:22:08,240
so and everyone in the room and in

5831
06:22:07,080 --> 06:22:11,520
particular the panelists have been

5832
06:22:08,240 --> 06:22:15,080
talking about how these attributes were

5833
06:22:11,520 --> 06:22:17,600
projected onto their own experiences and

5834
06:22:15,080 --> 06:22:21,040
so sanjoy has us doing projection

5835
06:22:17,600 --> 06:22:24,080
theorem uh for the the whole Symposium

5836
06:22:21,040 --> 06:22:26,798
uh I have two projections to my own uh

5837
06:22:24,080 --> 06:22:29,080
experiences with sanoy that are more so

5838
06:22:26,798 --> 06:22:33,160
sanoy is a role model than the then

5839
06:22:29,080 --> 06:22:34,840
Mentor uh the first was uh when I was a

5840
06:22:33,160 --> 06:22:37,320
PhD student at Lids I was here in the

5841
06:22:34,840 --> 06:22:40,400
80s and I was working with Mike Athens

5842
06:22:37,320 --> 06:22:42,120
and sanjoy uh he was on my committee

5843
06:22:40,400 --> 06:22:44,280
this is unrelated to his being on my

5844
06:22:42,120 --> 06:22:47,478
committee he was very proud of Lids as a

5845
06:22:44,280 --> 06:22:49,680
leader and as a leading lab and always

5846
06:22:47,478 --> 06:22:52,000
felt that lid students if there's an

5847
06:22:49,680 --> 06:22:54,040
interesting emerging direction should be

5848
06:22:52,000 --> 06:22:56,040
on top of that at least be aware of

5849
06:22:54,040 --> 06:22:58,798
what's what's happening and on a couple

5850
06:22:56,040 --> 06:23:00,920
of occasions he organized a reading

5851
06:22:58,798 --> 06:23:03,360
group uh you know to get us uh up to

5852
06:23:00,920 --> 06:23:05,520
speed on this uh on this area whether or

5853
06:23:03,360 --> 06:23:08,200
not it was related to or could be of use

5854
06:23:05,520 --> 06:23:11,280
for our dissertation just for the sake

5855
06:23:08,200 --> 06:23:13,240
of of being on on top of the field and

5856
06:23:11,280 --> 06:23:15,760
for these reading groups rather than

5857
06:23:13,240 --> 06:23:18,638
just assign papers to students and have

5858
06:23:15,760 --> 06:23:22,760
them present it he would also take the

5859
06:23:18,638 --> 06:23:24,558
time to prepare lectures uh himself and

5860
06:23:22,760 --> 06:23:27,878
I Ed the term prepare with some

5861
06:23:24,558 --> 06:23:29,240
reservation but he would do that and one

5862
06:23:27,878 --> 06:23:31,638
of these topics was for example

5863
06:23:29,240 --> 06:23:33,360
algebraic methods in in control and

5864
06:23:31,638 --> 06:23:36,478
controller factorization and

5865
06:23:33,360 --> 06:23:39,400
parameterization and the like and in one

5866
06:23:36,478 --> 06:23:41,760
lecture he wanted to illustrate just how

5867
06:23:39,400 --> 06:23:44,520
this perspective could

5868
06:23:41,760 --> 06:23:46,600
simplify uh a lot of uh kind of in or

5869
06:23:44,520 --> 06:23:49,040
and and also in give new insights and

5870
06:23:46,600 --> 06:23:50,760
simplify uh various types of

5871
06:23:49,040 --> 06:23:54,440
calculations and manipulations and in

5872
06:23:50,760 --> 06:23:56,160
control systems and uh so the point was

5873
06:23:54,440 --> 06:23:58,680
that it was just simple algebraic

5874
06:23:56,160 --> 06:24:02,000
manipulation so he's giving the lecture

5875
06:23:58,680 --> 06:24:05,280
and he got tripped up in some of the

5876
06:24:02,000 --> 06:24:07,558
manipulations on the board and he said I

5877
06:24:05,280 --> 06:24:09,798
I I seem to have made an algebraic error

5878
06:24:07,558 --> 06:24:13,120
but but the point is it's just algebra

5879
06:24:09,798 --> 06:24:14,958
okay and then and that was the end uh

5880
06:24:13,120 --> 06:24:18,040
the second experience I had when I was

5881
06:24:14,958 --> 06:24:20,120
now a new graduate and uh postto and I

5882
06:24:18,040 --> 06:24:24,320
happened to be uh invited to give a talk

5883
06:24:20,120 --> 06:24:25,320
at eth and he happened to be I Now

5884
06:24:24,320 --> 06:24:27,600
understand that wasn't really a

5885
06:24:25,320 --> 06:24:30,478
coincidence he happened to be in Italy

5886
06:24:27,600 --> 06:24:34,680
uh but then he invited me uh you know to

5887
06:24:30,478 --> 06:24:38,440
uh to swing by and uh he was very

5888
06:24:34,680 --> 06:24:40,798
welcoming and still I was feeling

5889
06:24:38,440 --> 06:24:43,120
somewhat

5890
06:24:40,798 --> 06:24:45,400
uncomfortable just from the perspective

5891
06:24:43,120 --> 06:24:48,120
that that such a prominent individual

5892
06:24:45,400 --> 06:24:51,040
would be spent such hours with me as a

5893
06:24:48,120 --> 06:24:53,240
gracious host and having extensive

5894
06:24:51,040 --> 06:24:56,798
conversations and treating me to these

5895
06:24:53,240 --> 06:24:58,878
uh uh lunches and and and dinner at the

5896
06:24:56,798 --> 06:25:01,760
time and how he would someone who's not

5897
06:24:58,878 --> 06:25:04,718
my PhD adviser uh and someone with whom

5898
06:25:01,760 --> 06:25:06,160
I've never written a paper uh would uh

5899
06:25:04,718 --> 06:25:08,478
kind of just spend this time and give

5900
06:25:06,160 --> 06:25:11,200
that time to me as a as a new uh a new

5901
06:25:08,478 --> 06:25:13,520
PhD graduate from Lids and it was only

5902
06:25:11,200 --> 06:25:16,000
later in my career that I came to really

5903
06:25:13,520 --> 06:25:18,200
appreciate those two experiences of of

5904
06:25:16,000 --> 06:25:20,040
the time that he spent with us as uh

5905
06:25:18,200 --> 06:25:22,520
leading the reading group or the time he

5906
06:25:20,040 --> 06:25:24,000
spent with me uh as my as the host and

5907
06:25:22,520 --> 06:25:26,718
then giving me that that gracious

5908
06:25:24,000 --> 06:25:28,638
invitation and especially now that I and

5909
06:25:26,718 --> 06:25:30,760
probably everyone in this room kind of

5910
06:25:28,638 --> 06:25:34,040
just feels perpetually busy we're just

5911
06:25:30,760 --> 06:25:36,160
busy all the time and uh and at that

5912
06:25:34,040 --> 06:25:38,718
time in my innocence I had no idea of

5913
06:25:36,160 --> 06:25:42,520
just how much demands there must have

5914
06:25:38,718 --> 06:25:46,360
been on sanjoy time and just it was

5915
06:25:42,520 --> 06:25:48,440
invisible to me uh the way he was uh uh

5916
06:25:46,360 --> 06:25:52,120
interacting with us and and and hosting

5917
06:25:48,440 --> 06:25:53,840
us and and hosting me and uh so sanjoy

5918
06:25:52,120 --> 06:25:55,718
as his generosity especially for

5919
06:25:53,840 --> 06:25:58,600
students especially for junior people

5920
06:25:55,718 --> 06:26:00,558
set a very high standard and and even to

5921
06:25:58,600 --> 06:26:03,320
use the Expression finding time for us

5922
06:26:00,558 --> 06:26:04,958
is is wrong is just he made time uh for

5923
06:26:03,320 --> 06:26:06,958
us to make sure that we had those

5924
06:26:04,958 --> 06:26:09,680
interactions with him just for what for

5925
06:26:06,958 --> 06:26:11,440
the sake of intellectual curiosity and

5926
06:26:09,680 --> 06:26:13,200
for the sake of a a scholarly

5927
06:26:11,440 --> 06:26:15,840
environment and and culture and for this

5928
06:26:13,200 --> 06:26:17,440
I'll always be grateful so thank you all

5929
06:26:15,840 --> 06:26:19,360
for this uh day I think there's still

5930
06:26:17,440 --> 06:26:21,950
some things coming in in uh in the next

5931
06:26:19,360 --> 06:26:28,330
session but uh thank you all for it

the 12 mons period mostly in 1934 so we

6072
07:04:11,160 --> 07:04:19,160
decided to form a club 19 Club

6073
07:04:14,478 --> 07:04:24,320
34 they we should try to beat again in

6074

6079
07:04:36,478 --> 07:04:43,398
so we met in 1994 as some conference

6080
07:04:40,080 --> 07:04:45,840
that don't remember now but 2004 the

6081
07:04:43,398 --> 07:04:48,398
20th

6082
07:04:45,840 --> 07:04:52,558

6084
07:04:52,558 --> 07:04:58,040
Beijing and in the ancient capit of CN

6085
07:04:56,320 --> 07:05:01,200
all four of them were there I think it

6086
07:04:58,040 --> 07:05:03,760
was the robotic automation society and

6087
07:05:01,200 --> 07:05:08,160
cence so we took

6088
07:05:03,760 --> 07:05:14,840
it a joy picture uh next to the Statue

6089
07:05:08,160 --> 07:05:18,160
of uh scholar confusious so that was

6090
07:05:14,840 --> 07:05:23,040
2004 but then at that time with we are

6091
07:05:18,160 --> 07:05:27,760
all 70 years old and we don't know how

6092
07:05:23,040 --> 07:05:30,240

07:05:30,240 --> 07:05:37,878
optimistic to look forward to

6095
07:05:34,200 --> 07:05:41,558
2014 we all be 80 years old beyond the

6096
07:05:37,878 --> 07:05:46,120

of Club

6133
07:07:41,478 --> 07:07:48,000
34 as you said this the name Club 33 has

6134
07:07:45,638 --> 07:07:49,638
already been taken so we never called it

6135
07:07:48,000 --> 07:07:53,200

6136
07:07:49,638 --> 07:07:57,120

6143
07:08:14,080 --> 07:08:18,798
so uh at the risk of being

6144
07:08:17,160 --> 07:08:21,760
self-promotion

6145
07:08:18,798 --> 07:08:27,080

am on Deadline I'm a journalist working

6179
07:10:09,478 --> 07:10:18,958
in the Arts um a mid-career shift that I

6180
07:10:14,120 --> 07:10:23,200
made uh 10 or 15 years ago and in which

6181
07:10:18,958 --> 07:10:26,680
my uncle sanjoy was extremely

6182
07:10:23,200 --> 07:10:30,718
supportive um bearing witness

6183
07:10:26,680 --> 07:10:32,760
to uh the way that my intellectual

6184
07:10:30,718 --> 07:10:36,200
curiosity

6185
07:10:32,760 --> 07:10:39,120
evolved away from an ear early Direction

6186
07:10:36,200 --> 07:10:41,440
in the social sciences and into

6187
07:10:39,120 --> 07:10:45,240
something uh that could have seemed

6188
07:10:41,440 --> 07:10:47,878
entirely new he

6189
07:10:45,240 --> 07:10:50,718
was Adept

6190
07:10:47,878 --> 07:10:53,520
at observing and understanding making

6191
07:10:50,718 --> 07:10:55,558
the connections and seeing how all these

6192
07:10:53,520 --> 07:10:56,718
things work together and how you can

6193
07:10:55,558 --> 07:11:01,558
think

6194
07:10:56,718 --> 07:11:05,280
about Society economy Civic practice

6195
07:11:01,558 --> 07:11:09,840
Civic possibility imagination life of

6196
07:11:05,280 --> 07:11:13,120
the mind uh through politics and

6197
07:11:09,840 --> 07:11:15,280
economics through science and philosophy

6198
07:11:13,120 --> 07:11:18,840
and indeed through the Arts in the end

6199
07:11:15,280 --> 07:11:22,280
of the day uh this pursuit of knowledge

6200
07:11:18,840 --> 07:11:25,958
and insight and Collective possibility

6201
07:11:22,280 --> 07:11:28,080
is like a uh kind of an Agora right a

6202
07:11:25,958 --> 07:11:30,478
public square into which we have all

6203
07:11:28,080 --> 07:11:33,320
these different roots to arrive and I

6204
07:11:30,478 --> 07:11:35,440
think that uh uh I heard I heard some of

6205
07:11:33,320 --> 07:11:37,878
the early part of the of the conference

6206
07:11:35,440 --> 07:11:39,600
this morning and and I can imagine the

6207
07:11:37,878 --> 07:11:41,600
the tonality of the rest of it I think

6208
07:11:39,600 --> 07:11:46,000
that you all know and have heard from

6209
07:11:41,600 --> 07:11:50,600
different perspectives how his mind um

6210
07:11:46,000 --> 07:11:52,080
welcomed and thrived on uh thinking

6211
07:11:50,600 --> 07:11:54,398
intellectually through all of these

6212
07:11:52,080 --> 07:11:57,718
directions and not in one and not in one

6213
07:11:54,398 --> 07:12:00,558
narrow field um

6214
07:11:57,718 --> 07:12:01,958
so uh he was very supportive in this

6215
07:12:00,558 --> 07:12:04,600
regard

6216
07:12:01,958 --> 07:12:09,558
um

6217
07:12:04,600 --> 07:12:12,878
his life at MIT and scientific life I I

6218
07:12:09,558 --> 07:12:15,398
have to say was a little bit of a black

6219
07:12:12,878 --> 07:12:17,638
box for some us some of us in the family

6220
07:12:15,398 --> 07:12:20,718
he kept it

6221
07:12:17,638 --> 07:12:21,798
um he kept he kept his compartments he

6222
07:12:20,718 --> 07:12:27,840
kept his

6223
07:12:21,798 --> 07:12:32,040
separations um but over the years uh we

6224
07:12:27,840 --> 07:12:35,600
became closer and closer uh and his

6225
07:12:32,040 --> 07:12:40,360
loyalty and support

6226
07:12:35,600 --> 07:12:43,878
and true intellectual curiosity were

6227
07:12:40,360 --> 07:12:47,000
absolutely never in question um I think

6228
07:12:43,878 --> 07:12:48,398
that uh I think somebody maybe earlier

6229
07:12:47,000 --> 07:12:51,280
this morning said something about a

6230
07:12:48,398 --> 07:12:55,718
Renaissance Prince or Renaissance Court

6231
07:12:51,280 --> 07:12:59,840
uh he he definitely was that

6232
07:12:55,718 --> 07:13:02,718
uh it comes from Kolkata it comes

6233
07:12:59,840 --> 07:13:04,558
from a a lot of deep roots that maybe

6234
07:13:02,718 --> 07:13:07,798
have been evoked today or that maybe

6235
07:13:04,558 --> 07:13:10,160
some of you will recognize in people in

6236
07:13:07,798 --> 07:13:15,360
your families and backgrounds of that

6237
07:13:10,160 --> 07:13:19,840
generation I hope that um we can

6238
07:13:15,360 --> 07:13:24,558
renew that impulse and continue

6239
07:13:19,840 --> 07:13:28,080
to uh and continue to uh to seed it in

6240
07:13:24,558 --> 07:13:31,718
younger Generations now especially given

6241
07:13:28,080 --> 07:13:34,478
the uh polarization and the fra ization

6242
07:13:31,718 --> 07:13:37,478
of discourse right now and what is

6243
07:13:34,478 --> 07:13:39,320
happening uh administratively and in the

6244
07:13:37,478 --> 07:13:42,760
in the conditions of fields and

6245
07:13:39,320 --> 07:13:45,798
universities um I I I I can tell you

6246
07:13:42,760 --> 07:13:48,478
with absolute certainty that he would

6247
07:13:45,798 --> 07:13:50,520
have been aast at what's happening in

6248
07:13:48,478 --> 07:13:54,280
universities in America in general right

6249
07:13:50,520 --> 07:13:57,160
now his politics were very clear he paid

6250
07:13:54,280 --> 07:13:59,680
very close attention he was absolutely

6251
07:13:57,160 --> 07:14:01,440
an anti-racist an anti-fascist and and

6252
07:13:59,680 --> 07:14:03,000
an internationalist

6253
07:14:01,440 --> 07:14:06,160
and I think that we should bear that in

6254
07:14:03,000 --> 07:14:09,798
mind as well uh and take uh

6255
07:14:06,160 --> 07:14:11,760
encouragement and uh fortitude uh from

6256
07:14:09,798 --> 07:14:14,040
that as we continue to fight these

6257
07:14:11,760 --> 07:14:16,878
fights forward in all of our respective

6258
07:14:14,040 --> 07:14:20,478
spheres so I'll leave you at that and I

6259
07:14:16,878 --> 07:14:23,000
want to thank you again uh for this very

6260
07:14:20,478 --> 07:14:26,160
generous occasion and for celebrating

6261

scientific

6266
07:14:37,440 --> 07:14:45,878

6269
07:14:50,760 --> 07:14:58,558
um I'm the founder and CEO of scientific

6270
07:14:55,478 --> 07:15:02,760
systems and sanjoy M played a very

6271
07:14:58,558 --> 07:15:05,840
important role uh in in in our company

6272
07:15:02,760 --> 07:15:09,478
actually I met sanjoy in

6273
07:15:05,840 --> 07:15:12,200
1969 at one of the conferences The Joint

6274
07:15:09,478 --> 07:15:15,080
automatic control conference and became

6275
07:15:12,200 --> 07:15:19,718
familiar with his work on the conjugate

6276
07:15:15,080 --> 07:15:21,958
gradient method with the lden and Warren

6277
07:15:19,718 --> 07:15:25,160
and that inspired me

6278
07:15:21,958 --> 07:15:28,360
for part of my PhD thesis so in fact I

6279
07:15:25,160 --> 07:15:31,120
ended up taking the work and using it

6280
07:15:28,360 --> 07:15:34,280
and extending it for for part of my my

6281
07:15:31,120 --> 07:15:35,878
PhD thesis and then when I joined

6282
07:15:34,280 --> 07:15:40,440
Harvard in

6283
07:15:35,878 --> 07:15:44,080
1972 uh I interacted with sanjo quite

6284
07:15:40,440 --> 07:15:47,240
often uh and in 76 uh I started

6285
07:15:44,080 --> 07:15:49,840
scientific systems and sanjoy was a a

6286
07:15:47,240 --> 07:15:53,080
consultant to us as well as an investor

6287
07:15:49,840 --> 07:15:56,360
in our company uh and with sano's help

6288
07:15:53,080 --> 07:15:57,920
we did a lot of work in what is now the

6289
07:15:56,360 --> 07:16:01,160
was at that time was called the

6290
07:15:57,920 --> 07:16:04,798
automated analysis of electrocardiograms

6291
07:16:01,160 --> 07:16:08,160
and sanjoy and uh his student

6292
07:16:04,798 --> 07:16:11,160
adant and Don Guston were doing that

6293
07:16:08,160 --> 07:16:14,398
work very pioneering work now of course

6294
07:16:11,160 --> 07:16:18,440
it's EGS are are well automated but that

6295
07:16:14,398 --> 07:16:22,680
was a pioneering work which we did in in

6296
07:16:18,440 --> 07:16:24,878
scientific systems at that time uh

6297
07:16:22,680 --> 07:16:28,080
withon and

6298
07:16:24,878 --> 07:16:32,760
Adan and then also we heard earlier

6299
07:16:28,080 --> 07:16:35,878
about uh Tom dako who was a student of

6300
07:16:32,760 --> 07:16:39,000
sanjoy at Cas and worked in the electric

6301
07:16:35,878 --> 07:16:42,440
power area so sanjoy introduced me to

6302
07:16:39,000 --> 07:16:44,200
him also and in the 80s we did a lot of

6303
07:16:42,440 --> 07:16:46,878
projects together with the Electric

6304
07:16:44,200 --> 07:16:50,878
Power Research Institute and Tom was

6305
07:16:46,878 --> 07:16:55,280
definitely a a great person and and

6306
07:16:50,878 --> 07:16:57,878
sanjoy U kept introducing me to uh

6307
07:16:55,280 --> 07:17:01,000
really great people uh

6308
07:16:57,878 --> 07:17:04,240
throughout our interaction and which

6309
07:17:01,000 --> 07:17:08,478
lasted uh I would say till till covid

6310
07:17:04,240 --> 07:17:12,200
times uh my last interaction uh was with

6311
07:17:08,478 --> 07:17:15,760
um Alan Canon bomb who was introduced to

6312
07:17:12,200 --> 07:17:18,760
me by sanjoy I think about 10 years ago

6313
07:17:15,760 --> 07:17:22,000
and sanjoy told me that uh alen's work

6314
07:17:18,760 --> 07:17:24,600
on this area new area of optimal mass

6315
07:17:22,000 --> 07:17:27,160
transport was going to be real

6316
07:17:24,600 --> 07:17:30,520
revolutionary and he was absolutely

6317
07:17:27,160 --> 07:17:34,398
right uh so we all sort of collaborated

6318
07:17:30,520 --> 07:17:36,520
on some work wrote some proposals on it

6319
07:17:34,398 --> 07:17:39,478
and we continued working with Al tenant

6320
07:17:36,520 --> 07:17:42,360
bom who unfortunately also died last

6321
07:17:39,478 --> 07:17:45,398
year so I have wonderful memories of

6322
07:17:42,360 --> 07:17:47,600
sanjoy and Adriana we used to get

6323
07:17:45,398 --> 07:17:50,440
together for dinners at their house at

6324
07:17:47,600 --> 07:17:51,478
their department and they came to our

6325
07:17:50,440 --> 07:17:54,878
house in

6326
07:17:51,478 --> 07:17:58,840
Lexington uh he was a real intellectual

6327
07:17:54,878 --> 07:18:01,840
real warm person we really miss him very

6328
07:17:58,840 --> 07:18:01,840

07:18:33,798 --> 07:18:41,920
few words to this gathering in honor of

6339
07:18:38,360 --> 07:18:46,000
my late husband

6340
07:18:41,920 --> 07:18:50,160
shanj shanj and I remained friends since

6341
07:18:46,000 --> 07:18:54,600
our first meeting on the shows of the

6342
07:18:50,160 --> 07:18:58,638
Indian Ocean on August 6th

6343
07:18:54,600 --> 07:19:04,080
1945 a date that many will remember as

6344
07:18:58,638 --> 07:19:04,080
it was the day the bam bomb hit

6345
07:19:04,798 --> 07:19:14,320
Hiroshima 12 years ago we took our

6346
07:19:08,080 --> 07:19:14,320
marriage vows and continued our strong

6347
07:19:14,360 --> 07:19:21,760
friendship shanai was a person of utmost

6348
07:19:18,478 --> 07:19:24,280
integrity and above all caring for his

6349
07:19:21,760 --> 07:19:28,638
students

6350
07:19:24,280 --> 07:19:32,638
worldwide wherever he is I hope that he

6351
07:19:28,638 --> 07:19:32,638
has found students to teach

6352
07:19:33,798 --> 07:19:39,000
on behalf of all his family in London I

6353
07:19:37,718 --> 07:19:41,160
wish him

6354
07:19:39,000 --> 07:19:45,360
peace Om

6355
07:19:41,160 --> 07:19:45,360
Shanti Shanty

6356
07:19:49,200 --> 07:19:56,080
Shanty sanjy mitter he was a true

6357
07:19:52,798 --> 07:19:59,000
Renaissance person he started in the

6358
07:19:56,080 --> 07:20:01,920
control field but he had much much

6359
07:19:59,000 --> 07:20:04,840
broader interests he was knowledgeable

6360
07:20:01,920 --> 07:20:09,080
and understanding and it stretched

6361
07:20:04,840 --> 07:20:13,000
through mathematics Science and

6362
07:20:09,080 --> 07:20:14,638
Technology he had the rare Talent of

6363
07:20:13,000 --> 07:20:18,040
seeing the broad

6364
07:20:14,638 --> 07:20:21,680
picture and he had great generality in

6365
07:20:18,040 --> 07:20:25,040
seeing the picture and great Focus he

6366
07:20:21,680 --> 07:20:27,920
could switch from abstraction to Broad

6367
07:20:25,040 --> 07:20:30,398
connections a detailed understanding

6368
07:20:27,920 --> 07:20:33,798
with ease it was always a pleasure to

6369
07:20:30,398 --> 07:20:37,200
talk talked to sanjy about research

6370
07:20:33,798 --> 07:20:39,558
education and almost everything he

6371
07:20:37,200 --> 07:20:42,280
usually had very interesting and

6372
07:20:39,558 --> 07:20:45,360
different viewpoints from most other

6373
07:20:42,280 --> 07:20:46,160
people he had many friends and admirers

6374
07:20:45,360 --> 07:20:49,798
at

6375
07:20:46,160 --> 07:20:52,000
MIT he had friends and admirers

6376
07:20:49,798 --> 07:20:54,120
nationally and

6377
07:20:52,000 --> 07:20:56,718
internationally he had a distinguished

6378
07:20:54,120 --> 07:20:59,160
research career but I'm not going to

6379
07:20:56,718 --> 07:21:01,840
talk about that here other people can

6380
07:20:59,160 --> 07:21:04,638
talk about it uh I will talk about his

6381
07:21:01,840 --> 07:21:08,920
long-term leadership at Lids which I

6382
07:21:04,638 --> 07:21:12,000
think is what I know the most about uh

6383
07:21:08,920 --> 07:21:14,760
he joined the MIT faculty and he joined

6384
07:21:12,000 --> 07:21:17,240
the control lab which was then called

6385
07:21:14,760 --> 07:21:21,478
the electronic systems lab

6386
07:21:17,240 --> 07:21:25,840
ESL as an associate professor in

6387
07:21:21,478 --> 07:21:28,320
1970 he worked at Brown Bou Switzerland

6388
07:21:25,840 --> 07:21:31,520
and then Case Western before coming to

6389
07:21:28,320 --> 07:21:37,120
MIT so he was already recognized as a

6390
07:21:31,520 --> 07:21:40,280
CER in the field it was uh DSL in that

6391
07:21:37,120 --> 07:21:44,360
period was getting much more conceptual

6392
07:21:40,280 --> 07:21:47,878
and math oriented much less application

6393
07:21:44,360 --> 07:21:50,160
oriented this was necessary because of

6394
07:21:47,878 --> 07:21:52,520
both the complexity of

6395
07:21:50,160 --> 07:21:56,040
implementations and the implementation

6396
07:21:52,520 --> 07:21:58,120
of the technology that was used for the

6397
07:21:56,040 --> 07:22:01,878
implementations that was stroken like a

6398
07:21:58,120 --> 07:22:05,280
through true theoretician

6399
07:22:01,878 --> 07:22:09,120
superb Theory people Brocket Yan

6400
07:22:05,280 --> 07:22:12,520
Williams George zames alone with sanjy

6401
07:22:09,120 --> 07:22:15,320
met they were added to the ESL faculty

6402
07:22:12,520 --> 07:22:18,520
at that time this was called the Golden

6403
07:22:15,320 --> 07:22:22,160
Era of control and MIT was certainly a

6404
07:22:18,520 --> 07:22:23,520
leader at that time the connection of

6405
07:22:22,160 --> 07:22:26,558
control and

6406
07:22:23,520 --> 07:22:30,478
communication was clear by

6407
07:22:26,558 --> 07:22:33,360
1970 especially to sanjoy there was a

6408
07:22:30,478 --> 07:22:38,080
dependence on information also at that

6409
07:22:33,360 --> 07:22:41,718
time the communication at area era area

6410
07:22:38,080 --> 07:22:43,638
at miit was broadening at that time

6411
07:22:41,718 --> 07:22:45,000
there was less emphasis on

6412
07:22:43,638 --> 07:22:48,200
point-to-point

6413
07:22:45,000 --> 07:22:51,920
communication more on networks and more

6414
07:22:48,200 --> 07:22:55,478
on congestion system issues the

6415
07:22:51,920 --> 07:22:59,120
communication era area combined with

6416
07:22:55,478 --> 07:23:01,600
electronic systems lab the form Lids in

6417
07:22:59,120 --> 07:23:03,558
1978

6418
07:23:01,600 --> 07:23:06,840
this was Far More Than Just a new

6419
07:23:03,558 --> 07:23:10,440
administrative unit all of us the

6420
07:23:06,840 --> 07:23:13,798
faculty and the grad students at Lids

6421
07:23:10,440 --> 07:23:16,680
recognized the commonalities in our work

6422
07:23:13,798 --> 07:23:20,000
this was primarily a payoff for San jooy

6423
07:23:16,680 --> 07:23:23,798
missionary work for many years before

6424
07:23:20,000 --> 07:23:26,280
1978 when the mercher occurred sanjoy

6425
07:23:23,798 --> 07:23:27,520
was not appointed director of the lab

6426
07:23:26,280 --> 07:23:30,760
until

6427
07:23:27,520 --> 07:23:33,718
1981 but he'd been the intellectual ual

6428
07:23:30,760 --> 07:23:36,558
leader of the combined effort in

6429
07:23:33,718 --> 07:23:38,080
communication and control for years

6430
07:23:36,558 --> 07:23:42,478
before

6431
07:23:38,080 --> 07:23:44,760
1978 working in ldz under sanj's direct

6432
07:23:42,478 --> 07:23:47,798
directorship was a memorable and

6433
07:23:44,760 --> 07:23:48,798
wonderful experience for most faculty

6434
07:23:47,798 --> 07:23:51,600
and

6435
07:23:48,798 --> 07:23:56,040
students the new faculty coming in at

6436
07:23:51,600 --> 07:23:59,360
that point uh especially uh theit bacus

6437
07:23:56,040 --> 07:24:01,200
and John cus took to the combined

6438
07:23:59,360 --> 07:24:04,920
orientation

6439
07:24:01,200 --> 07:24:06,840
naturally uh from sanjoy leadership

6440
07:24:04,920 --> 07:24:11,318
everyone understood how much they could

6441
07:24:06,840 --> 07:24:14,958
gain by working together uh they could

6442
07:24:11,318 --> 07:24:16,840
work together both from similar areas

6443
07:24:14,958 --> 07:24:19,398
and from very different

6444
07:24:16,840 --> 07:24:22,840
backgrounds it was easier to write a

6445
07:24:19,398 --> 07:24:25,920
paper on old stuff at that time than to

6446
07:24:22,840 --> 07:24:29,718
really get interested in a in an

6447
07:24:25,920 --> 07:24:32,080
in in a totally new area so it was much

6448
07:24:29,718 --> 07:24:35,160
harder for people to start working

6449
07:24:32,080 --> 07:24:37,440
together than one might think at first

6450
07:24:35,160 --> 07:24:40,440
there was a sense of competition also

6451
07:24:37,440 --> 07:24:43,360
between different people at the lab but

6452
07:24:40,440 --> 07:24:46,520
for the most part there was a real sense

6453
07:24:43,360 --> 07:24:49,000
that everybody wanted to help each other

6454
07:24:46,520 --> 07:24:52,398
and they wanted to be helped by others

6455
07:24:49,000 --> 07:24:55,878
they would listen uh which is sometimes

6456
07:24:52,398 --> 07:24:58,200
difficult today my sense is that sanjoy

6457
07:24:55,878 --> 07:25:01,040
was primarily responsible for this

6458
07:24:58,200 --> 07:25:05,680
Cooperative effort uh the whole time

6459
07:25:01,040 --> 07:25:09,478
that he was director from 1981 to

6460
07:25:05,680 --> 07:25:12,318
1999 I was a co-director from 86 to

6461
07:25:09,478 --> 07:25:15,398
99 but sanjoy was the intellectual

6462
07:25:12,318 --> 07:25:18,840
leader he was the master of working

6463
07:25:15,398 --> 07:25:22,120
together I just tried to help in small

6464
07:25:18,840 --> 07:25:24,760
ways I wish I could tell you the secret

6465
07:25:22,120 --> 07:25:27,718
of how to keep a lab of faculty and

6466
07:25:24,760 --> 07:25:31,360
students working together and helping

6467
07:25:27,718 --> 07:25:35,638
each other my only clue is it in the

6468
07:25:31,360 --> 07:25:38,080
long run helping is more satisfying than

6469
07:25:35,638 --> 07:25:40,280
competing a good set of

6470
07:25:38,080 --> 07:25:43,760
collaborators especially having a

6471
07:25:40,280 --> 07:25:46,920
director as a collaborator is truly

6472
07:25:43,760 --> 07:25:49,200
important thank you st joy for making

6473
07:25:46,920 --> 07:25:53,558
all of this

6474
07:25:49,200 --> 07:25:53,558
happen to my friend s

6475
07:25:53,798 --> 07:26:00,760
Joy I have known San joy since 1969

6476
07:26:00,920 --> 07:26:08,280
just after my

6477
07:26:03,760 --> 07:26:09,440
PhD it was before he joined MIT he was

6478
07:26:08,280 --> 07:26:13,760
still at

6479
07:26:09,440 --> 07:26:13,760
Cleveland K Western Reserve

6480
07:26:14,840 --> 07:26:20,478
University he was instrumental at the

6481
07:26:17,398 --> 07:26:24,360
origin of a cooperation between inia and

6482
07:26:20,478 --> 07:26:27,760
his research center in the

6483
07:26:24,360 --> 07:26:31,638
US the scientific fit was

6484
07:26:27,760 --> 07:26:34,878
immediate and the friendship followed

6485
07:26:31,638 --> 07:26:36,120
he invited me several times to MIT in

6486
07:26:34,878 --> 07:26:39,760
the early'

6487
07:26:36,120 --> 07:26:44,440
70s and he was a regular visitor of

6488
07:26:39,760 --> 07:26:47,798
inria his wife Adriana was Italian and

6489
07:26:44,440 --> 07:26:50,600
the friendship extended to the

6490
07:26:47,798 --> 07:26:52,160
family one of his main student at the

6491
07:26:50,600 --> 07:26:56,080
time was Michelle

6492
07:26:52,160 --> 07:26:58,798
deur a French scholar settled in

6493
07:26:56,080 --> 07:27:00,440
Montreal all of us became extremely

6494
07:26:58,798 --> 07:27:02,760
close

6495
07:27:00,440 --> 07:27:04,958
the research of sanjy and

6496
07:27:02,760 --> 07:27:08,160
Michael in those

6497
07:27:04,958 --> 07:27:11,600
days was devoted mainly to the control

6498
07:27:08,160 --> 07:27:15,040
of dynamic systems with

6499
07:27:11,600 --> 07:27:16,600
delays with Jack L Leons my supervisor

6500
07:27:15,040 --> 07:27:19,040
we were working on the control of

6501
07:27:16,600 --> 07:27:21,878
distributed parameter Dynamic

6502
07:27:19,040 --> 07:27:24,680
systems our techniques were very

6503
07:27:21,878 --> 07:27:28,000
close since they both represent case of

6504
07:27:24,680 --> 07:27:32,040
infinite dimensional dynamic system I

6505
07:27:28,000 --> 07:27:34,080
have always been very impressed by San

6506
07:27:32,040 --> 07:27:35,360
not just because of his competence in

6507
07:27:34,080 --> 07:27:38,718
control

6508
07:27:35,360 --> 07:27:41,600
theur but also because of his

6509
07:27:38,718 --> 07:27:43,680
culture he could speak many languages

6510
07:27:41,600 --> 07:27:45,958
including French he even learned

6511
07:27:43,680 --> 07:27:49,318
Sanskrit in

6512
07:27:45,958 --> 07:27:51,878
India for me look like a

6513
07:27:49,318 --> 07:27:54,440
gentleman with all the tradition related

6514
07:27:51,878 --> 07:27:57,440
to this world in Great

6515
07:27:54,440 --> 07:28:00,878
Britain he was educated in Great Britain

6516
07:27:57,440 --> 07:28:03,600
and work in Geneva where he learned

6517
07:28:00,878 --> 07:28:05,920
French he got a position of a school

6518
07:28:03,600 --> 07:28:08,760
normal in Pisa

6519
07:28:05,920 --> 07:28:12,520
Italy and became very related to the

6520
07:28:08,760 --> 07:28:12,520
famous mathematician JP

6521
07:28:12,718 --> 07:28:17,040
DPR have been very impressed by this

6522
07:28:15,000 --> 07:28:19,600
connection since after all he was

6523
07:28:17,040 --> 07:28:22,160
supposed to do research in

6524
07:28:19,600 --> 07:28:24,240
engineering clearly it was a sign of his

6525
07:28:22,160 --> 07:28:27,558
ability to work in various

6526
07:28:24,240 --> 07:28:31,478
domains and be respected by all the

6527
07:28:27,558 --> 07:28:34,478
experts in all of them

6528
07:28:31,478 --> 07:28:37,478
in my opinion it also reflects his

6529
07:28:34,478 --> 07:28:40,680
vision that mathematics was essential in

6530
07:28:37,478 --> 07:28:43,440
control of dynamic system as well as for

6531
07:28:40,680 --> 07:28:43,440
information

6532
07:28:45,280 --> 07:28:49,478
systems this for us very clear from the

6533
07:28:47,798 --> 07:28:52,440
very beginning in

6534
07:28:49,478 --> 07:28:54,318
1969 when the cooperation with Jack lons

6535
07:28:52,440 --> 07:28:57,240
and I was

6536
07:28:54,318 --> 07:28:59,478
initiated I've been very fortunate to be

6537
07:28:57,240 --> 07:29:03,958
involved in the initiative to write a

6538
07:28:59,478 --> 07:29:07,520
book in two volumes with Jose Jose D

6539
07:29:03,958 --> 07:29:07,520
Michelle delu and S

6540
07:29:09,160 --> 07:29:14,798
Jo his book is representation of control

6541
07:29:12,120 --> 07:29:19,520
of infinity dimensional system which was

6542
07:29:14,798 --> 07:29:22,558
published in 1992 in 1993 by be CER the

6543
07:29:19,520 --> 07:29:27,840
second edition in

6544
07:29:22,558 --> 07:29:31,200
2006 both sjo and J pass away in 2023 in

6545
07:29:27,840 --> 07:29:33,718
June and October

6546
07:29:31,200 --> 07:29:36,718
I want to thank both so much for this

6547
07:29:33,718 --> 07:29:38,398
fantastic common work which represent a

6548
07:29:36,718 --> 07:29:44,600
lot for

6549
07:29:38,398 --> 07:29:48,558
me sonjoy was will remain unique by many

6550
07:29:44,600 --> 07:29:50,360
standards a great scientist a gentleman

6551
07:29:48,558 --> 07:29:54,478
a wonderful

6552
07:29:50,360 --> 07:29:58,360
friend as an example and a reference and

6553
07:29:54,478 --> 07:29:58,360
forgettable forever

6554
07:30:00,878 --> 07:30:05,958
I just want to take this opportunity to

6555
07:30:02,878 --> 07:30:08,718
highlight Professor mither's one uh

6556
07:30:05,958 --> 07:30:11,798
trait which was his awareness of

6557
07:30:08,718 --> 07:30:14,080
research results from across

6558
07:30:11,798 --> 07:30:16,878
disciplines I remember a meeting with

6559
07:30:14,080 --> 07:30:18,638
Professor Shapiro and Professor mither

6560
07:30:16,878 --> 07:30:22,360
where Professor MIT had accompanied me

6561
07:30:18,638 --> 07:30:24,478
to Professor Shapiro's office and um

6562
07:30:22,360 --> 07:30:28,280
during a discussion with Professor

6563
07:30:24,478 --> 07:30:31,680
Shapiro very nonchalant Professor MIT

6564
07:30:28,280 --> 07:30:34,958
says and you know there a theorem by

6565
07:30:31,680 --> 07:30:38,318
korovich which does so and so and so I

6566
07:30:34,958 --> 07:30:40,760
was just flabbergasted like how could he

6567
07:30:38,318 --> 07:30:43,798
even know that result I mean of course

6568
07:30:40,760 --> 07:30:49,280
he works in optimal transport and so on

6569
07:30:43,798 --> 07:30:52,200
but um his um Rao with the results and

6570
07:30:49,280 --> 07:30:55,280
research across the board was quite

6571
07:30:52,200 --> 07:30:55,280
amazing thank

6572
07:30:55,760 --> 07:31:02,200
you I met sanjoy at Kate Western

6573
07:30:59,240 --> 07:31:04,360
University in in Cleveland almost 60

6574
07:31:02,200 --> 07:31:07,280
years ago 60 years

6575
07:31:04,360 --> 07:31:08,638
ago and in our frequent contacts and

6576
07:31:07,280 --> 07:31:11,760
then join

6577
07:31:08,638 --> 07:31:14,280
travel I have always been

6578
07:31:11,760 --> 07:31:17,398
impressed by

6579
07:31:14,280 --> 07:31:19,440
sanjy vast knowledge truly vast

6580
07:31:17,398 --> 07:31:22,638
knowledge not just

6581
07:31:19,440 --> 07:31:26,120
technical but also in very broad areas

6582
07:31:22,638 --> 07:31:31,040
of History literac culture

6583
07:31:26,120 --> 07:31:31,040
Humanities just blood humanities

6584
07:31:32,080 --> 07:31:38,718
I will talk just about sanjoy the

6585
07:31:35,920 --> 07:31:40,478
humanist I assume other colleagues will

6586
07:31:38,718 --> 07:31:42,760
discuss the scientific and his

6587
07:31:40,478 --> 07:31:46,440
scientific and Technical

6588
07:31:42,760 --> 07:31:46,440
contributions which are very

6589
07:31:46,798 --> 07:31:52,520
significant yeah it is natural that

6590
07:31:48,920 --> 07:31:55,958
sanjy who might consider the renaissance

6591
07:31:52,520 --> 07:31:58,120
man be married to Adriana from

6592
07:31:55,958 --> 07:32:00,600
Florence Florence is Center of

6593
07:31:58,120 --> 07:32:01,600
Renaissance

6594
07:32:00,600 --> 07:32:05,600
and they

6595
07:32:01,600 --> 07:32:08,440
spent a lot of their vacations in

6596
07:32:05,600 --> 07:32:13,558
beautiful Florence and my wife and I

6597
07:32:08,440 --> 07:32:13,558
were lucky to visit them a couple of

6598
07:32:13,798 --> 07:32:22,240
times we sanjoy and the group of us we

6599
07:32:18,360 --> 07:32:24,718
had many join travels and listening to

6600
07:32:22,240 --> 07:32:28,840
sanjy during our

6601
07:32:24,718 --> 07:32:30,478
travels was really an enjoyable learning

6602
07:32:28,840 --> 07:32:34,120
experience

6603
07:32:30,478 --> 07:32:37,120
perhaps the most significant travel we

6604
07:32:34,120 --> 07:32:40,680
had was when a group of

6605
07:32:37,120 --> 07:32:44,558
Us San Joy included with

6606
07:32:40,680 --> 07:32:48,240
us all of the age of

6607
07:32:44,558 --> 07:32:51,558
16 when we were taken to a long tour of

6608
07:32:48,240 --> 07:32:54,638
China organized by our generous Chinese

6609
07:32:51,558 --> 07:32:57,000
colleagues I was amazed that sanjo seem

6610
07:32:54,638 --> 07:32:59,920
to know more about cultural and

6611
07:32:57,000 --> 07:33:01,080
historical monuments than our excellent

6612
07:32:59,920 --> 07:33:05,120
professional

6613
07:33:01,080 --> 07:33:07,080
guide at at one point Sano asked that we

6614
07:33:05,120 --> 07:33:10,760
be taken to an ancient

6615
07:33:07,080 --> 07:33:13,718
pagod and he explained to the guide how

6616
07:33:10,760 --> 07:33:16,680
to get to it in the

6617
07:33:13,718 --> 07:33:18,958
Pagoda sanj spent time browsing through

6618
07:33:16,680 --> 07:33:19,840
ancient manuscripts and explaining to us

6619
07:33:18,958 --> 07:33:24,398
their

6620
07:33:19,840 --> 07:33:27,080
significance now imagine in a Chinese

6621
07:33:24,398 --> 07:33:30,798
pagod he is there and knows something

6622
07:33:27,080 --> 07:33:34,120
about this Ancient M

6623
07:33:30,798 --> 07:33:36,798
manuscripts well I would ask him

6624
07:33:34,120 --> 07:33:41,240
sometimes to talk about ancient

6625
07:33:36,798 --> 07:33:42,520
philosophers and he did it brilliantly

6626
07:33:41,240 --> 07:33:45,478
with

6627
07:33:42,520 --> 07:33:48,120
equal say I would say he would Express

6628
07:33:45,478 --> 07:33:53,040
criticism about some contemporary

6629
07:33:48,120 --> 07:33:56,360
philosophical Trends his interest was in

6630
07:33:53,040 --> 07:34:00,520
Classics contemporary philosophy was a

6631
07:33:56,360 --> 07:34:02,360
bit of a less interest for him but he

6632
07:34:00,520 --> 07:34:05,360
was a broad

6633
07:34:02,360 --> 07:34:08,318
broad he had a broad knowledge he was a

6634
07:34:05,360 --> 07:34:13,240
renaissance man and also a humanist of

6635
07:34:08,318 --> 07:34:17,398
our time he truly lived a full life

6636
07:34:13,240 --> 07:34:17,398
intellectual scientific full

6637
07:34:26,398 --> 07:34:31,878
life okay we thank uh the individuals

6638
07:34:29,718 --> 07:34:34,878
sent us the videos we saw videos of Dr

6639
07:34:31,878 --> 07:34:37,160
Alan Ben Susan Aman chaa and of course

6640
07:34:34,878 --> 07:34:40,600
the voice of Professor Peter

6641
07:34:37,160 --> 07:34:43,200
kotovich uh now we have uh a few written

6642
07:34:40,600 --> 07:34:49,240
tributes that some of us will go through

6643
07:34:43,200 --> 07:34:49,240
and read uh in order um so I'm going to

6644
07:34:52,160 --> 07:34:59,680
start the first one uh is by our uh

6645
07:34:56,478 --> 07:35:02,798
friend and colleague hendrik Sandberg uh

6646
07:34:59,680 --> 07:35:05,760
who was a professor at kth in

6647
07:35:02,798 --> 07:35:07,398
Sweden uh hendrik would have liked to be

6648
07:35:05,760 --> 07:35:08,798
here but he had some professional

6649
07:35:07,398 --> 07:35:12,360
obligation so he couldn't make it he

6650
07:35:08,798 --> 07:35:14,920
sent us a paragraph to read uh he writes

6651
07:35:12,360 --> 07:35:17,398
as a postto at Caltech in 2006 I

6652
07:35:14,920 --> 07:35:19,958
encountered the article information and

6653
07:35:17,398 --> 07:35:22,920
entropy flow in the calman buy filter by

6654
07:35:19,958 --> 07:35:25,080
sanjo mitter and Nigel Newton few papers

6655
07:35:22,920 --> 07:35:27,600
have I read so many times few papers

6656
07:35:25,080 --> 07:35:30,160
have puzzled me so deeply and few papers

6657
07:35:27,600 --> 07:35:32,240
have fascinated me as much as this one

6658
07:35:30,160 --> 07:35:34,240
beyond the calman buy filter it delves

6659
07:35:32,240 --> 07:35:35,840
into the second law of Thermodynamics

6660
07:35:34,240 --> 07:35:37,878
heat pumps information Supply and

6661
07:35:35,840 --> 07:35:40,280
dissipation hamiltonians and Maxwell's

6662
07:35:37,878 --> 07:35:42,398
demon the breadth of sano's interest and

6663
07:35:40,280 --> 07:35:44,600
insight is vividly Illustrated in this

6664
07:35:42,398 --> 07:35:47,080
work who else in our field could write a

6665
07:35:44,600 --> 07:35:48,600
paper with such an extensive scope this

6666
07:35:47,080 --> 07:35:50,398
paper is a gold mine that kept me

6667
07:35:48,600 --> 07:35:51,920
engaged for a long time and profoundly

6668
07:35:50,398 --> 07:35:54,080
inspired our research on measurement

6669
07:35:51,920 --> 07:35:55,958
back action many years later during my

6670
07:35:54,080 --> 07:35:58,558
sabatical at LDS my office was

6671
07:35:55,958 --> 07:36:00,680
fortuitously located next to sanjy to my

6672
07:35:58,558 --> 07:36:02,638
great joy he was in his office almost

6673
07:36:00,680 --> 07:36:03,920
daily and always took the time to meet

6674
07:36:02,638 --> 07:36:05,638
with me to discuss the intricate

6675
07:36:03,920 --> 07:36:08,760
relationship between statistical physics

6676
07:36:05,638 --> 07:36:10,798
and control theory initially my goal was

6677
07:36:08,760 --> 07:36:12,360
to create simple physical models to

6678
07:36:10,798 --> 07:36:14,160
illustrate the results of sanjoy and

6679
07:36:12,360 --> 07:36:15,878
Nigel's work however our discussions

6680
07:36:14,160 --> 07:36:17,680
quickly evolved leading to the

6681
07:36:15,878 --> 07:36:19,760
development of new performance bounds

6682
07:36:17,680 --> 07:36:22,200
for linear quadratic control which even

6683
07:36:19,760 --> 07:36:23,920
C the interest of physicists in my

6684
07:36:22,200 --> 07:36:25,520
conversations with sanjoy I often felt

6685
07:36:23,920 --> 07:36:28,080
like a humble engineer in the presence

6686
07:36:25,520 --> 07:36:30,398
of a great wise scholar always ready to

6687
07:36:28,080 --> 07:36:32,360
reveal new connections and relationships

6688
07:36:30,398 --> 07:36:35,360
to older work his knowledge of control

6689
07:36:32,360 --> 07:36:37,920
and information theory was nothing short

6690
07:36:35,360 --> 07:36:37,920
of

6691
07:36:41,478 --> 07:36:48,120
encyclopedic so the next one next one is

6692
07:36:44,638 --> 07:36:50,760
by sand colleague Richard winter sandre

6693
07:36:48,120 --> 07:36:53,878
stood out for his Grand Vision of

6694
07:36:50,760 --> 07:36:57,040
control the and his insight into it's

6695
07:36:53,878 --> 07:36:59,760
link with other field his extensive

6696
07:36:57,040 --> 07:37:03,000
contacts and wide reading mean that that

6697
07:36:59,760 --> 07:37:05,878
he was exceptionally well informed about

6698
07:37:03,000 --> 07:37:08,680
important research issues of the day and

6699
07:37:05,878 --> 07:37:09,600
ideas in circulation including those not

6700
07:37:08,680 --> 07:37:12,558
generally

6701
07:37:09,600 --> 07:37:15,080
known uh he had a repetition in

6702
07:37:12,558 --> 07:37:17,440
consequence of being the go-to person to

6703
07:37:15,080 --> 07:37:19,600
ask what research has been done in this

6704
07:37:17,440 --> 07:37:22,040
field regarding supervision and

6705
07:37:19,600 --> 07:37:24,600
collaboration he was at his best with

6706
07:37:22,040 --> 07:37:25,958
bright independent minded student and

6707
07:37:24,600 --> 07:37:29,120
doctoral

6708
07:37:25,958 --> 07:37:31,398
fellows uh these uh he would steer

6709
07:37:29,120 --> 07:37:33,520
toward serious topical research areas

6710
07:37:31,398 --> 07:37:36,240
then allow them the freedom to develop

6711
07:37:33,520 --> 07:37:39,000
their own ideas and in many cases

6712
07:37:36,240 --> 07:37:41,760
Advance them towards flourishing

6713
07:37:39,000 --> 07:37:44,680
academic careers to say he was cultured

6714
07:37:41,760 --> 07:37:47,398
would be an understatement multiculture

6715
07:37:44,680 --> 07:37:50,798
would be a more appropriate description

6716
07:37:47,398 --> 07:37:53,280
of someone at home in many language

6717
07:37:50,798 --> 07:37:55,920
languages and so immersed in the

6718
07:37:53,280 --> 07:37:58,520
cultural words of India European

6719
07:37:55,920 --> 07:38:00,958
countries and United States sandre was a

6720
07:37:58,520 --> 07:38:04,798
truly exceptional person and he will be

6721
07:38:00,958 --> 07:38:04,798
generally uh he will be greatly

6722
07:38:08,080 --> 07:38:14,558
missed so the next one is from Nigel

6723
07:38:11,360 --> 07:38:16,558
Newton I first me I I first met sanj

6724
07:38:14,558 --> 07:38:20,120
when I spent the semester on study leave

6725
07:38:16,558 --> 07:38:22,040
atlet in the fall of 1999 I remember his

6726
07:38:20,120 --> 07:38:24,240
infectious enthusiasm for

6727
07:38:22,040 --> 07:38:25,478
interdisciplinary scientific research

6728
07:38:24,240 --> 07:38:27,638
and for getting to grips of the

6729
07:38:25,478 --> 07:38:28,920
fundamentals of a problem this was at

6730
07:38:27,638 --> 07:38:30,920
the time where there was an increasing

6731
07:38:28,920 --> 07:38:33,360
pressure to follow topical discipline

6732
07:38:30,920 --> 07:38:35,760
specific Trends in research over the

6733
07:38:33,360 --> 07:38:37,958
years sanjo encouraged me to Cross

6734
07:38:35,760 --> 07:38:39,878
disciplinary boundaries and pursue lines

6735
07:38:37,958 --> 07:38:42,718
of research that I could not otherwise

6736
07:38:39,878 --> 07:38:44,318
considered I am most gra I am most

6737
07:38:42,718 --> 07:38:47,440
grateful for the moral and practical

6738
07:38:44,318 --> 07:38:49,840
support he provided during this period

6739
07:38:47,440 --> 07:38:52,440
along with his first wife Adriana who

6740
07:38:49,840 --> 07:38:54,878
passed away in 2008 Sanji was always a

6741
07:38:52,440 --> 07:38:57,160
gracious host he was he was very much a

6742
07:38:54,878 --> 07:39:01,120
citizen of the world my thoughts are

6743
07:38:57,160 --> 07:39:01,120
with with his widow rea

6744
07:39:07,120 --> 07:39:11,798
this is from Antonio Vino I'm very sad

6745
07:39:10,398 --> 07:39:14,798
for not being able to attend this

6746
07:39:11,798 --> 07:39:16,840
important event in honor of sanjoy I had

6747
07:39:14,798 --> 07:39:19,240
several occasions to meet sanjoy he

6748
07:39:16,840 --> 07:39:20,840
spent several weeks in Sienna he gave

6749
07:39:19,240 --> 07:39:23,478
several seminars and taught graduate

6750
07:39:20,840 --> 07:39:26,240
courses in my University his lectures

6751
07:39:23,478 --> 07:39:29,398
were always Illuminating and intriguing

6752
07:39:26,240 --> 07:39:31,478
I remember neatly one Sunday of 20 years

6753
07:39:29,398 --> 07:39:33,878
years ago when I met him by chance in a

6754
07:39:31,478 --> 07:39:35,958
restaurant in the Kean area he was

6755
07:39:33,878 --> 07:39:38,280
having lunch with his wife Adriana and I

6756
07:39:35,958 --> 07:39:39,760
was with my wife and son we spent some

6757
07:39:38,280 --> 07:39:41,798
time together at my place and after that

6758
07:39:39,760 --> 07:39:43,478
occasion we met several other times I

6759
07:39:41,798 --> 07:39:45,638
believe the systems and control

6760
07:39:43,478 --> 07:39:47,760
researchers are lucky to be able to cons

6761
07:39:45,638 --> 07:39:51,478
consider such a polyhedral researcher as

6762
07:39:47,760 --> 07:39:51,478
a member of their community

6763
07:39:59,478 --> 07:40:06,680
well this one is from sandre student

6764
07:40:02,920 --> 07:40:09,718
colleague Peter doruk it's a short one

6765
07:40:06,680 --> 07:40:10,958
uh Professor meter and I first met in

6766
07:40:09,718 --> 07:40:14,760
the mid

6767
07:40:10,958 --> 07:40:17,558
1970s he has had a great influence on my

6768
07:40:14,760 --> 07:40:19,840
activities ever since especially the

6769
07:40:17,558 --> 07:40:22,478
range of applications that interested

6770
07:40:19,840 --> 07:40:25,200
him and the diversity of disciples from

6771
07:40:22,478 --> 07:40:28,200
which he drew ideas he was a wonderful

6772
07:40:25,200 --> 07:40:31,240
person and an inspir inspiration to me

6773
07:40:28,200 --> 07:40:31,240
for half a century

6774
07:40:36,318 --> 07:40:41,440
okay uh the next comment is by Dr Janan

6775
07:40:39,638 --> 07:40:44,080
abunar director of The Sandbox

6776
07:40:41,440 --> 07:40:45,200
Innovation fund and a former student at

6777
07:40:44,080 --> 07:40:47,638
LDS and

6778
07:40:45,200 --> 07:40:49,240
ECS uh she writes sanjoy was the

6779
07:40:47,638 --> 07:40:51,798
director of Lids when I was a student

6780
07:40:49,240 --> 07:40:53,798
and he served on my thesis committee I

6781
07:40:51,798 --> 07:40:55,600
remember him fondly as a mentor and

6782
07:40:53,798 --> 07:40:57,040
dedicated faculty he was kind and

6783
07:40:55,600 --> 07:40:58,840
thoughtful I am honored to have known

6784
07:40:57,040 --> 07:41:00,718
him and to have benefited from his

6785
07:40:58,840 --> 07:41:04,520
guidance

6786
07:41:00,718 --> 07:41:07,200
and uh last on my end uh U Miss uh

6787
07:41:04,520 --> 07:41:10,638
Bernice Bry who's a friend and colleague

6788
07:41:07,200 --> 07:41:13,160
uh she was here earlier today writes um

6789
07:41:10,638 --> 07:41:15,360
I've known sanjoy since 1974 when my

6790
07:41:13,160 --> 07:41:17,160
late husband Jeremy Shapiro Sloan

6791
07:41:15,360 --> 07:41:19,318
professor of operations research and our

6792
07:41:17,160 --> 07:41:21,680
children traveled with sanjoy and

6793
07:41:19,318 --> 07:41:24,120
Adriana to

6794
07:41:21,680 --> 07:41:27,920
Venice um so with that I'm going to

6795
07:41:24,120 --> 07:41:27,920
leave it to colleagues

6796
07:41:30,160 --> 07:41:37,398
so this is me a message from Rachel

6797
07:41:33,160 --> 07:41:41,120
Rachel Cohen she was a she is or was I

6798
07:41:37,398 --> 07:41:44,240
guess sanj's longtime admin and friend

6799
07:41:41,120 --> 07:41:46,558
Professor Meer hired me parttime in 2001

6800
07:41:44,240 --> 07:41:49,520
my major qualification was typing in

6801
07:41:46,558 --> 07:41:52,240
latek he was a true gentleman and a joy

6802
07:41:49,520 --> 07:41:55,478
to work with and for in our more than 20

6803
07:41:52,240 --> 07:41:57,600
years together encompassing birth deaths

6804
07:41:55,478 --> 07:41:59,840
marriages and aging we maintain the

6805
07:41:57,600 --> 07:42:02,958
respect and caring that was a border of

6806
07:41:59,840 --> 07:42:04,718
work and life but never that of too much

6807
07:42:02,958 --> 07:42:07,240
he was such an easy person to want to

6808
07:42:04,718 --> 07:42:10,000
help but there was also there in my

6809
07:42:07,240 --> 07:42:14,360
times of need too supportive flexible

6810
07:42:10,000 --> 07:42:14,360
and in my corner I miss him every

6811
07:42:18,558 --> 07:42:25,280
day and this is from at gami who is one

6812
07:42:22,160 --> 07:42:27,718
of his sanjo post dos uh Professor sanj

6813
07:42:25,280 --> 07:42:30,160
mitter was a great mentor and friend his

6814
07:42:27,718 --> 07:42:31,878
kindness and support was beyond what I

6815
07:42:30,160 --> 07:42:33,840
can express with words he traded his

6816
07:42:31,878 --> 07:42:35,680
students and colleagues his family

6817
07:42:33,840 --> 07:42:37,318
during my time at MIT as Professor

6818
07:42:35,680 --> 07:42:39,360
mitter's postto it became clear to me

6819
07:42:37,318 --> 07:42:41,080
that he was widely liked and respected

6820
07:42:39,360 --> 07:42:44,040
with connections from all different

6821
07:42:41,080 --> 07:42:46,360
fields this reflected his great interest

6822
07:42:44,040 --> 07:42:47,878
and intellect so his great intellect and

6823
07:42:46,360 --> 07:42:50,360
interest in continuously learning new

6824
07:42:47,878 --> 07:42:52,360
things there's one conversation with him

6825
07:42:50,360 --> 07:42:55,360
that got printed in my brain and I will

6826
07:42:52,360 --> 07:42:57,398
never forget I remember we discussed how

6827
07:42:55,360 --> 07:43:00,080
to choose a path of research how to pick

6828
07:42:57,398 --> 07:43:03,558
a problem I said said that taste is very

6829
07:43:00,080 --> 07:43:05,600
important he replied taste is

6830
07:43:03,558 --> 07:43:08,398
everything these three words I will

6831
07:43:05,600 --> 07:43:11,558
never forget Professor mitter had great

6832
07:43:08,398 --> 07:43:13,958
taste in everything not only research he

6833
07:43:11,558 --> 07:43:16,240
was a true identifier of quality and you

6834
07:43:13,958 --> 07:43:17,958
can see his Spirit still alive at Lids

6835
07:43:16,240 --> 07:43:20,558
when he was director for 18 years he

6836
07:43:17,958 --> 07:43:20,558
will be missed

6837
07:43:26,840 --> 07:43:32,680
dearly uh this is a message from Tom

6838
07:43:29,920 --> 07:43:35,040
kyth I first met sanjoy at Imperial

6839
07:43:32,680 --> 07:43:37,558
College in the summer of 1972 and we

6840
07:43:35,040 --> 07:43:39,558
were both spending a few weeks there I

6841
07:43:37,558 --> 07:43:41,718
was immediately impressed by his Poise

6842
07:43:39,558 --> 07:43:44,280
and his diction he never seemed to be in

6843
07:43:41,718 --> 07:43:47,000
a hurry about anything and this remained

6844
07:43:44,280 --> 07:43:49,160
true all the years that I knew him

6845
07:43:47,000 --> 07:43:51,160
sanjoy had a wide range of professional

6846
07:43:49,160 --> 07:43:53,200
and social interests so our

6847
07:43:51,160 --> 07:43:55,280
conversations were quite wide ranging

6848
07:43:53,200 --> 07:43:58,040
from control theory to quantum physics

6849
07:43:55,280 --> 07:44:00,280
and statistical mechanics I profited

6850
07:43:58,040 --> 07:44:02,798
from his eagerness to expound on these

6851
07:44:00,280 --> 07:44:04,680
topics our main technical discussion in

6852
07:44:02,798 --> 07:44:06,160
the late '70s was on something I had

6853
07:44:04,680 --> 07:44:08,200
introduced called The White Noise

6854
07:44:06,160 --> 07:44:10,718
Innovations process associated with a

6855
07:44:08,200 --> 07:44:12,718
given stochastic process without going

6856
07:44:10,718 --> 07:44:14,280
into details there was a technical issue

6857
07:44:12,718 --> 07:44:17,478
associated with what is called the

6858
07:44:14,280 --> 07:44:19,280
Innovations conjecture on the resol on

6859
07:44:17,478 --> 07:44:21,558
the resolution of which several papers

6860
07:44:19,280 --> 07:44:23,520
have been written by mathematicians

6861
07:44:21,558 --> 07:44:26,080
mostly in Japan and the former Soviet

6862
07:44:23,520 --> 07:44:28,160
Union to my mind the most progress on

6863
07:44:26,080 --> 07:44:29,558
this issue was made in a paper by sanjoy

6864
07:44:28,160 --> 07:44:32,760
and his MIT

6865
07:44:29,558 --> 07:44:35,878
collaborator uh Deborah allinger uh the

6866
07:44:32,760 --> 07:44:37,638
ma mathematics of which was beyond me I

6867
07:44:35,878 --> 07:44:39,638
find myself in that position with

6868
07:44:37,638 --> 07:44:41,398
several of his papers including a recent

6869
07:44:39,638 --> 07:44:43,638
one written with the distinguished

6870
07:44:41,398 --> 07:44:46,120
Princeton mathematician Charles

6871
07:44:43,638 --> 07:44:48,240
feferman I would be remissed not to

6872
07:44:46,120 --> 07:44:50,478
mention my warm interactions with sano's

6873
07:44:48,240 --> 07:44:52,798
late wife Adriana at their homes in

6874
07:44:50,478 --> 07:44:55,240
Cambridge and in Florence and later with

6875
07:44:52,798 --> 07:44:58,558
his wife raika in Cambridge and in

6876
07:44:55,240 --> 07:45:01,440
London um my son-in-law George I suppose

6877
07:44:58,558 --> 07:45:03,440
he's ref in to me but um has been

6878
07:45:01,440 --> 07:45:05,718
diligent in keeping me posted on the ups

6879
07:45:03,440 --> 07:45:08,398
and downs of sanj's Health in recent

6880
07:45:05,718 --> 07:45:10,318
months and of sanjoy typical optimism

6881
07:45:08,398 --> 07:45:12,878
that he would return to his office at

6882
07:45:10,318 --> 07:45:14,440
MIT it is a thought that may temper our

6883
07:45:12,878 --> 07:45:17,000
grief that we shall not be seeing our

6884
07:45:14,440 --> 07:45:19,318
dear friend again in the words of the
