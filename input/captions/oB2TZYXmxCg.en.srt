00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,920
well here we are out on the MIT athletic

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,720
fields and I'd like to demonstrate the

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,719
principles of rocketry using not a

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,719
chemical rocket but a water rocket now

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,719
we have to put the propellant in it

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,320
which is the water so I'm going to fill

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,480
it about a third of the way we need to

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,199
leave enough room for the air we are

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,199
ready to go now I'm going to put in the

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,119
energy that we need for the

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,199
rocket and since everything we do in

12
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,320
space flight we're very concerned with

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,000
safety I'm going to put on my safety

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:46,440
goggles and now we'll pump it up to

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,879
about three atmospheres 5 4 3 2 1

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,680
launch

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
beautiful

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,120
boom that's a pretty tough

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,920
rocket for more MIT moments from MIT
