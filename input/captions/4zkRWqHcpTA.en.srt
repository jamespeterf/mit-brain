1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Everyone, welcome. My name is Katherine

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,839
Ferrar and I'm have the privilege of

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,639
being on the admissions team here at

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,080
Sloan and oversee um our master business

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,960
analytics program, our master of

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
finance, and our MBA early offering in

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,599
addition to some of the other programs

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,440
that were touched on in that video. We

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,880
hope you enjoyed that. I think it's a

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
great way to share a little more about

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,720
the what you'll find here when you get

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
to Sloan and um the the community that

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,119
you'll find here as well. Um, but today

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm going to be focusing um on our

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,039
Master Business Analytics program

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,559
specifically. Um, and as my colleague

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,480
shared in the chat, if you have

18
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,920
questions, please use the Q&A function

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
to submit those. We'll do our best to

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,800
try to get to all of them and we'll save

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
some time at the end to answer a few

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,079
live as well. Um, but with that, go on

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
to the next slide.

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,719
Um, so we first like to kick off uh

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,520
talking about our mission. Um, it's core

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,960
to everything we do here um at the Sloan

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
School. We are educating students to

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,480
fulfill this mission um which is to

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,239
develop principled innovative leaders

30
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
who improve the world and generate ideas

31
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,760
that advance management practice. Um

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,559
you'll find opportunities to build

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,760
skills within this um um within

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
aspirations of this mission through

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
different electives um that you take and

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
uh through different organizations and

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,320
student activities that you might become

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,799
a part of once you're a student here at

39
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,240
Sloan. And then um in addition, I like

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
to highlight too as you're thinking

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
about um you know this program and maybe

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
submitting an application, you know,

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,799
when you're writing uh your essays and

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,439
other pieces in the application, you

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
know, think about past experiences that

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,040
um you know, may have used pieces of

47
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
this mission um and how you've applied

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
it to what you've done to date um that

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,640
align with the goals of this mission.

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,439
So our portfolio programs, we also like

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
to share this slide too um to show that

52
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,799
you know you would be coming to the

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,560
master of business analytics program but

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,720
you're going to be exposed to students

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,280
in a variety of programs here at Sloan.

56
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,119
So we have um masters of finance as I

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
mentioned the MBA program, our leaders

58
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,600
of global operation program, our Sloan

59
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,799
fellows MBA, our executive MBA and our

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
master of science and management

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
studies. Um so you'll have an

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
opportunity to you know really build a

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,680
network and get exposure not just uh

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,680
folks who are going to be a part of the

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,840
masters of business analytics um but

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
take classes and um participate

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,040
extracurriculars with students across uh

68
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,040
the degree programs here at Sloan.

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,200
And so on this slide um I just like to

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,239
highlight this is a full-time program.

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,160
Um it's 12 months. Um it's a rigorous uh

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
um quantitative degree focused on

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,520
applying the tools of modern data

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
science to solve real world problems in

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
business and society. Um it's for

76
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
someone you know you don't necessarily

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,599
have to come from a STEM background, but

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,440
we do like to see that you have comfort

79
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,040
um with quantitative focuses. So have a

80
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
strong background in mathematics,

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,519
computer science, and statistics is

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,519
helpful. Um and I do um want to

83
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,840
highlight too that it's three semesters.

84
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,400
So you have fall, spring and summer uh

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,400
with this program.

86
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
So what is business analytics? Um for

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
those who are early in their research,

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
it's an approach to solving problems

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,159
that starts with data. You build models

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
and arrive at decisions that create

91
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,080
value for the organizations that you

92
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,080
will be in.

93
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
And again, um just highlighting it's a

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,599
full-time 12-month program. Um some ask

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
if it's part-time but at MIT we don't

96
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,879
offer part-time programs. Um so 12

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
months full-time and you again applying

98
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,800
uh tools of modern data science

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,239
optimization machine learning. Um this

100
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
program is also in close partnership

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
with MIT's operation research center um

102
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,159
which is a discipline of applying

103
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
advanced analytics methods such as

104
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
optimization, statistics, machine

105
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,879
learning and probability um to help make

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
better decisions that impact society and

107
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,760
the world positively. Again, tying back

108
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
to our mission. Um, and again, it's a

109
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
it's a rigorous curriculum in terms of

110
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,280
quantitative skills. Um, and so there's

111
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
a lot of different electives that you

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,560
can choose from that will spin out with

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,400
those and close ties to computer science

114
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,640
and electrical engineering at MIT as

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
well.

116
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,080
And I'll touch more on the capstone

117
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,840
action learning component here in a

118
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,599
little bit. But here is an overview of

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,879
uh the curriculum that you'll find over

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,560
these um three semesters. in you'll see

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,680
in the middle there winter semester

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
during January. Um it's called IEP

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,639
independent activities period. It's

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,160
MITwide. Um it's an opportunity to do um

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
different focuses outside of just a

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,360
regular coursework. Um but with uh the

127
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,160
business analytics program, you'll be

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
kicking off your capstone um review and

129
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
and putting together your team and

130
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
meeting with companies. Um again, I'll

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
go further into what capstone project

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,400
is. It is a highlight of the business

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,120
analytics program. Um, we added a couple

134
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
of new uh courses on here as well. Um,

135
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,400
but you can go on our website as well to

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,040
dive a little deeper into the curriculum

137
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,040
and learn specifics.

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,320
And I just like to highlight um the

139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,199
analytics faculty. We're very lucky to

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,440
have some world-class uh faculty uh here

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,360
at Sloan. Um, and you will have an

142
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
opportunity to potentially do research

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,880
assistantships with these faculty

144
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,919
members. I'll touch on that more here in

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,919
just a minute as well.

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,800
So um inband students can apply to be a

147
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,199
research assistant with the MSE faculty

148
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
member of their interest um in the fall

149
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,479
or spring semesters. Um it is an

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
application through them. It's not

151
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,280
through the admissions office. So that's

152
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,600
something that you would do once you're

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,360
here and metriculated on campus. Um it's

154
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
a commitment about 10 hours per week and

155
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,039
it does help offset your tuition and you

156
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,039
get about uh 13,000 per semester.

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
And then here are um some examples of

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,639
research that students have done with

159
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,400
faculty.

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
I just we just like to share this if

161
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,720
you'd like to look at some of them. It

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,240
does uh go across a variety of focuses

163
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,880
in industries, sustainability,

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,880
healthcare and transportation.

165
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,360
And so the analytics capstone project um

166
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,840
it is again a a hallmark of uh the

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,520
business analytics program. Um it begins

168
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,720
in January and runs through August. It's

169
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,440
a 10-month project. uh it's 24 units. Um

170
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,000
you uh are in a team of two. Um you work

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,560
on a real life uh data science problem

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,600
with a company over a course of seven

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,199
months. Um and you have a dedicated team

174
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,800
of MIT faculty and PhD team to help

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
support you during this time. Um

176
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
basically you're kind of working with

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
this company in kind of a consulting

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
role helping them scope out and identify

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
issues. Um you meet with them at least

180
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,680
once a week. Um then you have u a

181
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,720
full-time summer work experience with

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,759
the company um over the summer in

183
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
person. Um and it's a $22,000 tuition

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,880
offset as well and you are provided a

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
small living expense during the

186
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,360
summertime and then at the end for this

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,520
program that students do graduate in

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
August each year. Um, so you come back

189
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
to campus, um, you complete a final

190
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,479
written report and as well as a

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,919
presentation, um, with the host company,

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,599
um, and you present this at what's

193
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,960
called the capstone showcase at the end

194
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,240
of August before your graduation.

195
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,639
This is a great opportunity to have an

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
immersive experience and and to work on

197
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,000
site. Um, you get real world experience

198
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,599
in the field of data analytics and data

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,599
science. It's a great resume builder as

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,599
well.

201
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
And here are some of the companies um

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,240
that students uh participated in last

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,080
year and this year. Um as you can see it

204
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
again is a lot of recognizable companies

205
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,759
that span a variety of industries. So

206
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
there's a lot of different areas of

207
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,880
interest that you could be um

208
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,880
participating in on these projects.

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,240
And then here are some sample capstone

210
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,240
topics as well.

211
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,639
And I will just give a little plug that

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
there is a component of the capstone

213
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
showcase that is live streamed each

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
year. Um we will be posting this on our

215
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,599
website. So just stay tuned to our

216
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,440
admissions events page. I think it's

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,400
going to be August 15th this year. So if

218
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,479
you'd like to see some of the

219
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,479
presentations live, you can join that.

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
So career support um when you come to

221
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
study with us we know it's um very

222
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,199
important not only to learn about a

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,599
specific industry but um you know also

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039

225
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,720
our career development office really

226
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,319
partners with students um before they

227
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
even metriculate to help you kind of

228
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,440
develop a plan and better understand

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
what it means to work within data

230
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,759
science and or analytics or product

231
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,400
management or you know like whatever um

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,240
your interest might be for this program.

233
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,440
Um, you know, folks coming into this

234
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,200
program are early career. Um, we see

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,880
people coming in who have primarily just

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
internship experience. So, there's a lot

237
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
more structure into supporting students

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
in this program. Um, you'll receive a

239
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,080
dedicated career adviser who will work

240
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
closely with you throughout the program

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
and help you identify what you might

242
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,320
want to do and develop a plan for your

243
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,880
job search. Um, I will highlight that uh

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,240
we have a career core that's built into

245
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,839
the first semester and it's meant to

246
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,080

247
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,240

negotiate your offer letters as well. Um

251
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
so there's a lot of support and

252
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
networking opportunities that the career

253
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,680

provides for students within this

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
program.

256
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,880
And here's just an overview of some of

257
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,440
the comprehensive career services.

258
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,240
And we do have um industry speaker

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,920
opportunities for students all around to

262
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,519
connect with alumni as well and

266
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,519
And so this is just to share um some

267
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
sample job titles. Some people earlier

268
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
on or you know what what does someone

269
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
with a business analytics degree go

270
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,800
into. So you can see that under the

271
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
sample job titles. Of course data

272
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,440
scientist is one of the most popular um

273
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,760
focuses to go into but there's a wide

274
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
range. Um machine learning engineer,

275
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
operations analyst, product analyst,

276
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,440
portfolio manager um and other titles

277
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
that you can see there. And then um

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
these are some of the companies that our

279
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
students have gone into after they

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,959
graduate. Um and again you can see it it

281
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,680
spans a wide variety of of industries

282
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,399
and focuses.

283
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,920
Um if you'd like to you can go online um

284
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
and look at our employment reports and

285
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,760
you can see greater detail and

286
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,720
breakdown. Um but this slide just

287
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
highlights um the average base salary

288
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
from our most recent employment report

289
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
um and some of the locations of where

290
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,920
students have accepted jobs within the

291
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:45,120
US. Um over around uh 90% 96.5

292
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,720
um or 95.6% excuse me have accepted jobs

293
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,040
here within the US. And then um 18.6% of

294
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,800
students um actually were able to secure

295
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,800
their job u through capstone companies.

296
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,800
And here's an overview of the MBAN class

297
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,480
profile um from 2025.

298
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
I like to share this just to highlight

299
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,160
some of the backgrounds that uh students

300
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
come from. Um you can see it's not just

301
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,120
STEM focuses. So again, it's not a

302
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
requirement to come from a STEM

303
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,079
background. Just be comfortable with

304
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,839
quantitative skills. Um 40% women. Um

305
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,680
the average GPA is 3.92. Um, we have the

306
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
average GRE on here because that's the

307
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,279
test that most students decide to submit

308
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,880
or applicants, excuse me. So, that's the

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
best data that we have, but we don't

310
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,519
have a preference between the GMAT GRE

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,600
or GMAT focus. Um, and then you'll also

312
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,600
see I like to highlight um the your time

313
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,279
of work experience is around eight or 15

314
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,760
months average work experience. That

315
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,760
does include internships.

316
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
Um I just like to highlight this uh

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,200
slide too with the various clubs that

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
some of our um students in the business

319
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,720
analytics program participate in because

320
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,320
you do have a wide variety of

321
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,640
extracurriculars open to you as a

322
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,040
student here in data science and

323
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,640
analytics and beyond. Um student clubs

324
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,959
are a really great tool to give you

325
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,160
exposure different types of industries.

326
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,399
Um build relationships with alumni. um

327
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
and also with potential companies. So I

328
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,720
would a lot of these clubs do secure

329
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,880
company um executives to come and speak

330
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,120
who might be looking to hire students.

331
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,040
Um so there's a lot of great um

332
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
opportunities to uh participate in once

333
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
you get here. There's some conferences

334
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
as well that can also help you get

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,760
industry exposure and partner with

336
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,600
industry practitioners coming to campus

337
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
and speak at these. So they're great to

338
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
get involved with and build

339
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,519
relationships and can certainly lead to

340
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,519
lead to employment opportunities.

341
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,680
So, moving on to our application, I will

342
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,519
highlight that we have not released um

343
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,440

344
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,680

346
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,040

347
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,519
So, please stay tuned. Um but we will do

348
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,920
have um some components here that I'll

349
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,240
review quickly. We have the onepage

know, obviously internships or any

356
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,279
teaching assistantships are helpful to

357
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,279
share here as well.

358
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
And then we have our essay questions, a

359
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,440
500word limit um for this past year.

360
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
That could be changing, but um I'll

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,680
speak to what we had for this past

362
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,200

363
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
why are you pursuing this program and

364
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,680
what you hope to gain um from joining um

365
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,760

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,720
program. Um we have a short answer

367
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,440
question as well. um how the world uh

368
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,839
shaped you um and it's an opportunity to

369
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,880
expand on your background u um and how

370
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,680
that has uh helped you grow and develop.

371
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,399
We have three letters of recommendation

372
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,560
uh that are required. Um for those who

373
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
are current students, um we ask that you

374
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,880
submit three academic uh letters of

375
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,000
recommendation. One must come from

376
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,800
someone who can speak to your

377
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,800
quantitative abilities. Uh for those who

378
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,600
might be working full-time, um please

379
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,240
submit two letters of um academic uh

380
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,880
from academic sources, excuse me, and

381
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,399
one from a professional or a recent

382
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,600
employer. Um we don't accept letters of

383
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,040
recommendation from family members um so

384
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,920
just a note there um for those who might

385
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,560
be in family businesses. And then um

386
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,199
academic transcripts of course um two

387
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,920
video questions. So the first one is a

388
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,839
60-second um time frame. Um it's an

389
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,760
opportunity to introduce yourself uh to

390
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,279
future classmates. And the second

391
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,040
question is a randomly generated

392
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,279
open-ended question. Um you have 10

393
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,600
seconds to prepare and then a one minute

394
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,760
response for that. And they're very easy

395
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,279
questions. Um it's nothing you need to

396
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,720
worry about preparing for in advance.

397
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,000
It's just to kind of assess your

398
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,760
communicate communication ability.

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
And then of course relevant coursework

400
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
and professional certifications. You can

401
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,839
share those if you have them. um not

402
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
required um but if you do have if you

403
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
took any online course work or have a

404
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,279
CFA or something like that it's helpful

405
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,279
to share that there um and again as I

406
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,279
mentioned for test scores we accept the

407
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,480
GMAT GRE and GMAT focus and we really

408
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,560
don't have a preference between the

409
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,279
three

410
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,839
and interviews are required um they are

411
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,680
conducted um online uh so virtually

412
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,360
through Zoom um and you will have some

413
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,839
questions beforehand that we will submit

414
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,199
to you they change year to year um but

415
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,680
you will have time to prepare for those

416
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,680
before your interview.

417
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,760
All right. So, I know we went through

418
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,399
that quickly, so if there's any

419
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,399
questions, um, happy to try to answer.

420
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
Absolutely. All right. Uh, hi everyone.

421
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,279
My name is Steve. I'm also a part of the

422
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,880
admissions team here. Uh, Katherine,

423
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,720
thanks so much for going through a lot

424
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,959
of the information regarding the MBAM

425
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,720
program. I do have a few questions that

426
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
uh I wanted to run past you, but you

427
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,440
know what? I'll give you a quick break.

428
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
I know you just talked for a little bit,

429
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,399
so feel free to take a sip of water.

430
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,639
There were a few questions that came

431
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,839
through that were reoccurring, and I'm

432
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,759
happy to uh address those uh as well.

433
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,920
So, a couple of questions off the bat

434
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,759
that came in regarding the application

435
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,240
components. Uh, as Katherine mentioned,

436
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,000
we will have um more of an app tips

437
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,160
webinar coming up later regarding the um

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,199
the the program itself, but I'm happy to

439
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
touch on a few uh aspects as well. So,

440
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,440
first and foremost, there were a lot of

441
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,959
questions about if the GRE or the GMATs

442
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,800
are um mandatory for this program. The

443
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,040
answer is no, they are not. They are

444
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,600
optional and you can submit your scores

445
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,959
uh if you so choose. Uh then the next

446
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
question in your mind might be okay well

447
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
if it's optional what's the benefit of

448
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,600
submitting scores versus not well the

449
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,920
benefit andor um how that's calculated

450
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
is that if you have a a score that you

451
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,839
are proud of and you feel is a um a

452
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,600
strong representation of your analytic

453
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,600
skills then by all means we think that

454
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,800
that's a good opportunity to submit that

455
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,360
score. However, if you choose to not

456
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,679
submit a GRE or a GMAT score that will

457
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
not negatively impact your application.

458
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,199
What we will do instead is we will look

459
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,280
at the data points that you've submitted

460
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,280
with your application and make our

461
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,760
decision based off of those data points.

462
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,120
So by just uh not including a test score

463
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,720
that all that means is that we would

464
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,079
just have one less data point. But if

465
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,839
you still feel strongly about your

466
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
application with those other points

467
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,240
that's completely fine. Uh the other

468
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
question that came through was just in

469
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,080
regards to our deadlines themselves and

470
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
if there is any benefit to applying

471
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,480
early if we have a rolling status and

472
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,960
that the answer to that is no. we

473
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,080
actually uh do not look at applications

474
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,160
until after the deadline has passed. So

475
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,039
really utilize as much of the time as

476
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
you need to craft what you think is the

477
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,440
strongest application that you can

478
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,280
possibly make. Uh once you feel that

479
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,720
it's at its strongest, that's when I

480
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,640
recommend that you hit the send button

481
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,640
on that application. And then from

482
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
there, uh all of our applications are

483
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
are jumbled together. There is no

484
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
indicator of time. Those that applied

485
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
early don't get first preference in

486
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,039
terms of reading. everything is kind of

487
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,240
pulled together for our readers to um uh

488
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,400
to look at. But with that said, I do

489
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
have a couple of questions that did come

490
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
through. Uh Katherine, now that you've

491
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,480
had a little bit of a break to

492
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
>> Thank you, Steve.

493
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,640
>> Of course. Uh so one question that came

494
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,400
through is uh actually um centered

495
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,080
around the program. Somebody wanted to

496
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,720
know if um having in internship during

497
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,880
their undergraduate program is mandatory

498
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,799
to be admitted into the MBA program or

499
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,840
sorry the MBAN program.

500
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,679
>> Great question. Um it is not mandatory.

501
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,679
Uh actually no work experience is

502
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,679
required uh as part of your application

503
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,840
to to um be a candidate for this

504
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,400
program. However, we do like to see

505
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,440
leadership um experience. So but that

506
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
doesn't have necessarily have to be

507
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
through an internship or full-time work

508
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,480
experience. They can be through

509
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
extracurriculars if you were president

510
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,240
of club or you know you were a teaching

511
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
assistant or a research assistant in

512
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,080
your undergraduate studies as well. Um

513
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,559
those can be great ways to to showcase

514
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,960
that but again it's not required.

515
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,880
>> Excellent. Okay great. I know there are

516
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
a lot of questions regarding the

517
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,679
application components to the degree

518
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,679
itself. Um I will just say again that we

519
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,919
will have another session later on in

520
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,600
the fall that will go into a deeper dive

521
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
about the the components themselves. I

522
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
love that folks are uh thinking ahead in

523
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,919
regards to that. Uh although there is

524
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,280
this one question I think that folks do

525
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,039
have in mind is that um what if there

526
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,600
are in your experience Katherine

527
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,240
extracurricular activities that you have

528
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,760
seen or examples of that folks uh dive

529
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,039
into that are common occurrences on uh

530
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,000
applications.

531
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,600
>> Thanks. Yeah, another great question. Um

532
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
really like when you're looking at

533
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,320
choosing extracurriculars, choose

534
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,840
something that you're passionate about.

535
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
Because if you're just choosing it

536
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,440
because you think it'll help build your

537
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
resume or your your candidacy for the

538
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
program, you're not really interested in

539
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,679
it, that's really going to show um for

540
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
us um as we're looking through it. Um so

541
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,600
that's the that's the my biggest piece

542
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,440
of advice for that. Um but as I said,

543
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
you know, we are looking for um

544
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,320
leadership experience in in some ways an

545
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,919
example. So certainly participating in

546
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,799
extracurriculars and and and getting

547
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,320
those leadership roles um can be helpful

548
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,240
in in showcasing that in your

549
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
application,

550
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
but it doesn't necessarily have to be

551
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
data analytics focused.

552
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,720
>> Perfect.

553
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,960
All right. Excellent. Um now, uh some of

554
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,679
our folks in the audience uh and this is

555
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,880
definitely a hot button topic as we uh

556
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,039
talk about the the different types of um

557
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,280
curriculum that we offer here at Sloan.

558
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,159
Could you highlight if there are any

559
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,760
opportunities for our um MBAN students

560
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,200
to be get involved in the lovely world

561
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,360
of AI and any AI related courses?

562
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
>> Yes, definitely. Um I I I know we went

563
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
over it quickly um but one of the new

564
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,799
courses that's being offered for the

565
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Ozen business analytics is a deep

566
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,360
learning course. Um and that's part of

567
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,760
your core uh courses in the fall. Um MIT

568
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,840
is very focused on AI. Um so you'll find

569
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
that built into a lot of uh the

570
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,919
coursework that we have here at Sloan

571
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,480
and MITwide. Um there's a lot of

572
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,640
initiatives around it too. So there's um

573
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,080
some extracurricular student clubs um

574
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
some research the faculty are working

575
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
on. There's a lot actually a lot of

576
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,720
research the faculty are working on

577
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
right now that's AI focused. Um so

578
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,840
there's definitely opportunities um to

579
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,799
build and hone the skills in that area

580
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,640
if that's what you're interested in.

581
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,400
>> Excellent.

582
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,880
Great. Thank you so much. Um, now in

583
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,640
terms of uh other questions that have

584
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
been coming through, sorry, as many

585
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
folks are starting to fly through. So,

586
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,240
one question that I think folks wanted,

587
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,000
this is a two-part question for you,

588
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,919
Katherine. For those that are coming

589
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,919
from a uh a non- STEM background for

590
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,919
this program, would that particularly

591
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
hinder one's application?

592
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,440
>> Definitely not. Um, it's again, it's not

593
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
a requirement to come from a STEM

594
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
background for this program. Um, you

595
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,360
know, we know when you get here, we're

596
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
we're here to teach you and train you

597
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,280
the foundations of data science and

598
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,480
analytics. Um, we are setting you up to

599
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,039
be successful um, leaving Sloan and and

600
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,960
going into the data science world. Um,

601
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,400
so we don't expect you to already have

602
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,280
all those things under your belt once

603
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,799
you arrive. However, um, we do want you

604
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,480
to be comfortable with quantitative work

605
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,640
because you will do um, computer

606
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,559
programming. um you will have you know

607
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,400
some you it's helpful to have some

608
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,640
background in mathematics and statistics

609
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,799
and calculus uh to do the coursework

610
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
once you arrive here. Um so we do like

611
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,640
to see that um you know either in your

612
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,360
undergraduate work or if you choose to

613
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,360
take some online coursework as well.

614
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,360
>> Excellent.

615
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,600
>> All right. Perfect. Um so let's dive

616
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,039
into kind of the second part of that

617
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,720
question is that for those that uh saw

618
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,720
in some of the requirements there are

619
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,760
required courses that we are looking for

620
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,080
within the the program itself. Is it

621
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,159
expected to have completed all of the

622
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,520
required courses that uh are listed on

623
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,919
the application?

624
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,760
>> Good question. It it is not. Um it's

625
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,080
certainly helpful to to share as many of

626
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,679
those as you can. Um but again we're not

627
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,240
looking for you to have the full list

628
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
completed. Um it is again I will

629
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,000
highlight the computer programming

630
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,120
piece. Obviously it's being data science

631
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,600
analytics you know having familiar

632
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,039
familiarity with Python or Julia is

633
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,799
definitely going to be helpful for you

634
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,400
um once you join the program.

635
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
>> Perfect.

636
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
Great. Uh there have been a few

637
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,200
questions that have been coming through

638
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,880
on the chat as well just regarding years

639
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
of experience and I'm happy to take this

640
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,159
to you Katherine. I just want to get

641
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,559
your two cents on it as well for folks

642
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,799
that I'd say uh that are on let's say

643
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,159
the higher side of looking at three

644
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,480
years worth of experience or beyond um

645
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,240
and how that kind of fits into this

646
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,679
particular program for the amount of the

647
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,200
profile that we normally see of folks

648
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
having zero to two years worth of

649
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,440
experience uh if that would negatively

650
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,080
impact their application. What I would

651
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,159
just say is that for this particular

652
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,159
program, we are norm we are looking for

653
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,840
those between zero to two years worth of

654
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
experience that if you have more uh

655
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
years worth of experience by the time of

656
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,720
metriculation or coming into the program

657
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
in August, we may have a conversation if

658
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,200
there is a different program within our

659
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,679
portfolio that might be uh a better fit

660
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,760
for you. For example, our MBA program or

661
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,679
some of our other uh offerings. Would

662
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,559
you agree with that uh statement,

663
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,880
Katherine?

664
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,400
>> Yeah, definitely. um you know as you

665
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
mentioned you know maybe the MBA program

666
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
might be better if you are looking to

667
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,440
hone your skills in data science we do

668
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,440
have a certificate that allows you to

669
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,000
focus and do a deeper dive within the

670
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,240
MBA program for business analytics um

671
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,919
but really you want to think about when

672
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,000
you're trying to decide the two programs

673
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,480
is you know the business analytics

674
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
masters uh is preparing you to go out

675
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
into the world of data science you're

676
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,440
going to be going into more of an entry-

677
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,440
level role um you're going to be

678
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,200
building your leadership um there might

679
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,880
be pieces that may not be applicable to

680
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,559
you if you have a greater than, you

681
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,600
know, 5 years of work experience or

682
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,480
more. Um, it may be redundant of what

683
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,520
you're learning. So, you want to think

684
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,720
about the cohort you're going to be

685
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,880
going into and what's going to be the

686
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,400
most beneficial for you um after you

687
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
graduate.

688
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
>> Perfect.

689
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,600
Excellent.

690
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,240
All right. Great. So, I'm scanning

691
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
through. I know we've got plenty of uh

692
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,600
questions that have still been coming

693
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,760
through, so please keep me honest uh in

694
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,640
regards to that. Um, one that is

695
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,039
actually uh something I want to touch on

696
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,720
is that for those that are, let's say,

697
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,960
doing a research opportunity with a

698
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,799
current professor, does that technically

699
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,760
count as full-time experience at this

700
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,960
point?

701
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,799
>> Um, if it would count as um part-time

702
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,559
experience or an internship. So, that

703
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,120
would be absolutely something to include

704
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,720
on um your resume and share with us. I

705
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,400
think it's if you're do four months or

706
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,880
or greater then it would count as

707
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,200
full-time work experience but if not if

708
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,240
it's less than that um or under you know

709
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,159
30 hours a week um that's part-time.

710
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,520
>> Perfect.

711
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,799
>> Katherine um in terms of uh numbers as

712
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,400
we kind of look at the the class

713
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
profile. So the first one I'll I'll

714
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,240
happily take for you. some there were

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
some questions regarding if someone

716
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,679
didn't fall into let's say the average

717
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,559
or the median range of things like their

718
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,200
test scores our GPA or anything along

719
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,600
those lines if they should hold off

720
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,640
applying until they meet those criteria

721
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,840
to that I would say no I would there's

722
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,080
the the median GPA that we have is not a

723
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,400
a beall end all that is just the the

724
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,000
median if we have folks that um fall

725
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
outside of that range that is completely

726
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
fine in doing so uh what I would just

727
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,120
recommend to you is making sure that you

728
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,360
feel or finding ways to um create a

729
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,240
strong application and submit that based

730
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,480
off of the experiences that you uh

731
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,840
personally have. But for you, Katherine,

732
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm not sure if we have these statistics

733
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,919
on hand, but would you be able to

734
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,080
comment on the popularity of this

735
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,279
program, whether it be the amount of

736
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,200
applications we receive per seat or um

737
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,240
uh how many are accepted into the

738
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,640
program?

739
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,200
>> Yeah. um because it varies year to year.

740
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Um we don't share how many are accepted,

741
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,720
you know, the percentage of acceptance

742
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,080
rate um because it does change. Um so we

743
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,400
don't want to set expectations or

744
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,000
disappoint. Um but as far as the

745
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,159
applications we receive each year for

746
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,159
the program, um it's generally, you

747
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,480
know, can range between 15 to 2,000

748
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,320
applications every year. Um and there's

749
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
80 seats that we usually try to stick

750
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,640
with for this program. So you can kind

751
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,880
of do the math on on that end.

752
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,200
>> Excellent.

753
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,039
Perfect. So, keep me honest, Katherine.

754
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,240
How many more uh how much time do we

755
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,919
have left for questions?

756
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,840
>> Uh we we have about 10 minutes, so we

757
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,440
have we have some time to cover a few.

758
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,720
>> Okay, perfect. Uh let me go through uh

759
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,080
some of the questions that we've had

760
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,760
coming through. Um

761
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
>> I can quickly while you're looking I I

762
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,679
saw someone asking about the RA

763
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,000
application process. Um again, that'll

764
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,440
be something that um is handled directly

765
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,320
through the professors you're looking to

766
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,799
do the rehip with. Um so once you are

767
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,480
metriculated and come on campus um you

768
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,480
generally will take your first course

769
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,080
semester and then look at um

770
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
participating in an RA ship with

771
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,640
professors. So it's something you would

772
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,559
do later um here once you're at Sloan.

773
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
>> Perfect. And actually, this is a good

774
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,320
one that um I think will a lot of folks

775
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,640
would like to know about is that the the

776
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,120
program itself can seem very STEM

777
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,760
focused and fast-paced program, but what

778
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,600
are some common characteristics that set

779
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
successful candidates apart in terms of

780
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,120
either mindset or just going beyond

781
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
their technical skills?

782
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,799
>> Yeah. No, great question. Um again, like

783
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,200
you know, this program is very

784
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,200
technical, but it's also um we're hoping

785
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,640
to build you as a a business leader,

786
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,880
too. We want you to be able to, you

787
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,279
know, have both sides of those skill

788
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
sets. Um, so someone who has, you know,

789
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,200
leadership experience, um, someone who

790
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,840
has an innovative mind thought, um, who

791
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,840
who enjoys the challenges of learning,

792
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,279
um, and going past the status quo is

793
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,880
important. Um, and then also having a

794
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,480
collaborative spirit though, you know,

795
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
um, I think maybe it was mentioned in

796
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,320
the video of the motto here of Sony's

797
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
helping Sloan is a very collaborative

798
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,480
environment. Um, every there's a lot of

799
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,240
teamwork focuses in the curriculum and

800
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,440
then the extracurriculars that you'll

801
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,039
see here.

802
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,039
you're broken down into teams, you're on

803
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,559
a team with the capstone project. So,

804
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,960
that's a huge component and we look for

805
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,960
that too in your application.

806
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,240
>> Great.

807
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,279
>> And Katherine, would you mind just

808
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,120
commenting on um any fellowship or

809
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,880
scholarship opportunities outside of the

810
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,679
capstone that might be associated with

811
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,679
this program?

812
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,679
>> Yeah, great question. Um so, every

813
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,679
student who submits an application is

814
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,760
automatically considered for merit-based

815
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,279
um fellowship funding. Um so, you don't

816
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,320
have to submit a different um

817
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,520
application. um you will uh know once

818
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,880
you receive your decision for the

819
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,120
program if you've been awarded any

820
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,480
fellowships. Um but again, you do have

821
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,039
that $22,000 offset from the capstone uh

822
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,799
company um time. Um and so that's that's

823
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,960
really a great benefit of the business

824
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,520
analytics program.

825
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,440
>> Perfect. And as I started to scroll back

826
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,720
through and look through some of our

827
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,640
other questions, I'll give you a quick

828
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,559
break as well. Um, one question that

829
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,320
came through was, is there a heavy focus

830
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,240
on health care in AI at MIT? While I say

831
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,840
that it's slightly niche that we

832
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,000
probably have a few classes that touch

833
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,159
on healthcare and also AI involved with

834
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,440
healthcare, what I will comment and I'll

835
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,279
also mention is that at MIT Sloan, we

836
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,360
have seven different certificates that

837
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,760
are available and open to folks across

838
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,320
all of our programs. So, one of those

839
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,399
seven certificates being uh in the space

840
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
of healthcare. What are certificates?

841
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,480
They're basically like what you could

842
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,679
consider a minor from an undergraduate

843
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,760
university or honestly a road map of uh

844
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,399
giving you an idea of how to take

845
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,480
specific electives uh to focus in on a

846
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,159
respective topic. So we have uh product

847
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,159
management, analytics, finance,

848
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,919
entrepreneurship as other examples of

849
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,279
certificates. So that could be a good

850
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,919
balance for you if you're really looking

851
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,919
to take your career in that that way and

852
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,600
focus in on the healthcare space to take

853
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,520
that uh particular um uh certificate. Uh

854
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,880
but going back to the question that I

855
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:04,080
had for you Katherine is someone was

856
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,240
curious how our MBAN program or MBAN

857
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,559
program differs from the masters of

858
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,880
finance or even the Sloan MBA in terms

859
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,159
of analytic intensity or career

860
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,399
flexibility.

861
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,480
>> Yeah. No. Um another great question. Um

862
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,960
so this program is for someone who's

863
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,120
looking to go solely into data analytics

864
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,320
and and um you know that's their

865
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,760
passion. That's what they're they're

866
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,760
looking to do long term for their

867
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,440
career. Um, you know, again, there

868
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
there's some of the leadership softer

869
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,159
skills that you'll learn here as well

870
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,000
for the program because we think that

871
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,159
that's very important for you to have as

872
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,559
you go out um into working for

873
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,919
organizations, but we want you to be um

874
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,679
you know at a at a prolevel skill set of

875
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
uh data science analytics. So, that's

876
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,519
the main focus of this program. The

877
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
masters of finance, similarly, the main

878
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,880
focus is going to be finance. Um it's

879
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,159
going to be for someone who knows that,

880
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,960
you know, finance is going to be their

881
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,440
career. Um, for the MBA program, I think

882
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,279
the difference is you the MBA you can

883
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,640
certainly focus and and specialize in

884
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,840
certain areas. As Steve mentioned,

885
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,480
there's those certificates that are

886
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,320
open. Um, but really it's more of a

887
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,480
generalized degree because you gain a

888
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,960
wide variety of skills when within that

889
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,919
program. Um, so if you're looking to,

890
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,840
you know, do uh maybe different career

891
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,799
pivots um during your time, an MBA can

892
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,279
help you with that because it's more of

893
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,519
a generalized degree.

894
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,080
>> Excellent. And this was a question that

895
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,679
I wasn't familiar uh with an answer, but

896
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm just curious if you have any uh

897
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,200
insight into as well is that for folks

898
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,440
that have completed the um the MBAN

899
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,919
program, do you normally see students

900
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,519
that have a pathway into a PhD programs

901
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,360
within MI MIT?

902
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,320
>> Yeah. No, it's a good question. Um we do

903
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,159
see a handful every year. Um, usually

904
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
the students choose to do a thesis or

905
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,440
component and and certainly um

906
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,600
participate with the research

907
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,120
assistantships, but we do see a handful

908
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,720
each year um that are interested in the

909
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,320
PhD.

910
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,159
>> Excellent.

911
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,399
Uh going back to the background of of

912
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,440
candidates coming into the the program

913
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,559
itself, for uh candidates that are not

914
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,200
coming from a STEM background, are there

915
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,360
any courses, certificates, or skills you

916
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,519
recommend completing ahead of time to

917
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,120
make their applications seem a little

918
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,960
bit more complete?

919
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,039
>> Yeah. Um, you know, it's certainly up to

920
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,559
your your schedule and your capacity.

921
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,559
But again, if you don't have strong

922
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,559
comfort or familiarity with computer

923
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,559
programming languages, you know, Python

924
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,399
at a minimum, um, that might be a great

925
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,200
course to take online and and get and

926
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,600
brush your skills u up on that one. Um,

927
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,600
and then, you know, certain mathematics

928
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,159
courses, calculus, statistics certainly

929
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,919
would be helpful to um, take uh, for

930
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
this program as well.

931
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,760
>> Excellent.

932
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,880
Okay, perfect.

933
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,880
Let's see here. As I go through,

934
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,159
still have plenty of uh of questions

935
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,600
that have come through, but I'm trying

936
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,480
to find some that uh might attain or um

937
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,640
pertain to to all that are involved as

938
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,480
well. Um, oh actually could you give a

939
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,960
little bit of insight into after the

940
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,040
application component moving on to the

941
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,079
next part of our evaluation process uh

942
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,839
how that what those uh conversations are

943
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,839
structured as and what folks can expect

944
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,280
from the interview aspect.

945
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,280
>> Yeah. So it's a conversational

946
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,040
interview. So they're going to be um you

947
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,240
know reviewing your application and

948
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,560
their questions are going to come from

949
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,599
that. They may ask you to elaborate and

950
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,679
speak more to it. Um, so obviously being

951
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,760
prepared on what you submitted uh for

952
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,639
your interview and then um they do have

953
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,800
some u pre-in questions um that you'll

954
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,960
you will submit. Um they change year to

955
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,720
year. Um they're technical questions um

956
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,200
but that's something that you will have

957
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,720
advanced notice to prepare for um and be

958
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,480
ready for by the time you you get to

959
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,399
your interview.

960
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
>> Perfect. And is there any say like um

961
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,280
the questions themselves are they more

962
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,399
quantitative focused, behavioral focus,

963
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,079
a mixture of both?

964
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
>> Quantitative. Yes. So, the questions

965
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,400
themselves are going to be more

966
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,640
quantitative focused. The interview is

967
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,440
more conversational, behavioral.

968
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,440
>> Perfect. Excellent.

969
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,079
All right. Great. And I know that we're

970
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,640
we're coming up on time and I'm trying

971
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,800
to see if there are any final uh

972
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,400
questions that we have. Actually, uh one

973
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,400
I guess I'll go back to the the

974
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,320
application to kind of close us out. is

975
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,359
that uh if for those that are coming

976
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,599
from an undergraduate uh background, are

977
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,200
those folks allowed to have two academic

978
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,440
letters of recommendation and one

979
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,240
professional uh letter of recommendation

980
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,280
or should it be a different skew?

981
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,880
>> Yeah, so if you are currently a college

982
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,960
um senior and you're looking to apply to

983
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,040
this program or still in your studies,

984
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,800
um we do ask that you submit three

985
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,440
letters of um recommendation from

986
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,760
academic sources. Um, but if you are

987
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,320
someone who is working full-time at this

988
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
point, um, it's it's fine to submit one

989
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,760
professional letter of recommendation

990
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,280
and two academic letters of

991
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,240
recommendation.

992
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,040
>> Very good. All right, folks. I know that

993
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,200
we have a number of interviews or a

994
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,640
number of questions that have are still

995
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,800
out in the chat. We've tried to get to

996
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,000
as many as we could in our time, but I

997
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,160
also want to be respectful of everyone's

998
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,240
time as we kind of wind things down uh,

999
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,079
and talk about next steps. So,

1000
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,320
Katherine, over to you. That is going to

1001
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,359
be it for me for our Q&A portion.

1002
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,880
>> Thanks, Steve. Thanks for helping

1003
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,320
moderate. Great questions, everyone. As

1004
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,160
Steve mentioned, I know there's a bunch

in here. Um, I think we answered a good

1006
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,079
bit, too. But, um, the ones we didn't

1007

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,480
business analytics, um, capstone

1015
