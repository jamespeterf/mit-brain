9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,439
>> Um, welcome back. Uh, thanks for not

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,840
dropping the class yet.

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,840
>> Oh, I got to do that right now.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,640
>> Funny you mention that.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,320
Uh let's see. Uh just a reminder

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
actually the one big reminder for folks

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
who weren't here on Friday is that we

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,280
swapped around Friday and Mondays 17th

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,680
and the 20th have been swapped.

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
>> Yeah.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,320
>> In terms of readings and what we're

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
going to do in class.

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,559
>> Yes. So, uh we're still going to be

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,039
playing the games on Friday on Friday.

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,239
Uh but uh the brainstorming activity

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
that we have scheduled for Monday is

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,680
going to be on this Friday instead. And

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,160
and then we can flip around otherwise.

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,079
So um I want to manage to get through

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,840
the readings.

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,320
Uh cool. Uh let let's see where should

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,439
we start? Um so there was D Church

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,119
article which was on Gamma Sutra and uh

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,200
if if you're familiar with Gamma Sutra

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,880
it's or if you're not actually it's a

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,880
fairly

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,840
well read news and industry sort of

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,439
industry news blog for uh for the games

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,439
industry but largely the digital game

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,240
industry. Um that particular article I

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,400
think was originally written not for the

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,079
website but for the magazine that the

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
associated company publishers for the

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,880
game development magazine uh and Doug

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,960
Church is actually an MIT alum uh

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,759
him and the other article that was read

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,759
Mark actually MIT alums so that's one

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,799
thing

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,280
um so Dr. proposes a a set of tools.

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,040
Anyone remember what they call the

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,119
formal?

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,040
>> Yeah, the fat.

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:09,039
>> Yeah. Um so and and uh uh framework

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
which is

53
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,200
>> m

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,440
>> Yeah. Mechanics.

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,080
>> Yeah. Um and we kind of kind kind of

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,400
covered mechanics and dynamics on uh uh

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
on Friday and today we have a little bit

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
of time to talk about aesthetics. But

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,959
the reason why these two essays were

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,200
kind of put right next to each other was

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:35,519
NDA is an example of what uh Duncan was

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,840
describing for design. Um in fact at the

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,599
time when NDA came out it was pretty

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,760
much the only one that caught on. um

65
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
everybody all the problems that Doug

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,239
Church lays out in his article about the

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,239
problems that we don't have a vocabulary

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
that consistent vocabulary to talk about

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,480
our craft and thus we can't actually

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,200
improve on it. Um and thus we need some

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,239
some formal tools to uh that that

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,720
everyone uses. Uh unfortunately not much

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,120
has caught up um MDA being one of the

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,720
few that has um because it you know for

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,920
a number of different reasons. First of

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,599
all, it it actually is a is a useful

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
framework. You know, you can think of

78
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
many many ways to formally look at

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,120
games, but from a designer, you need to

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
to to think of something which you can

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,040
actually apply to help improve your

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,000
games. And MDA actually gives you a uh

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
uh a reason why design is hard, you

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,799
know. So, if nothing else, designers

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,000
like it a lot because it says this is

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,799
why my job is hard. Um,

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,720
and the reason being you get to control

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
the mechanics, but that's not what

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,920
you're going for. You're not going for

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,879
really interesting mechanics. They're

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,319
really they're going for a really

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,920
interesting aesthetic. They're going for

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,920
a fun, engaging play experience. There

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,000
are Mark uh uh in the MDA paper this

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,440
eight kinds of fun. And I've asked him

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,640
about this when he gave this

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,400
presentation here in in MIT. Those eight

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
were not meant to be comprehensive. they

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
they were meant to be. These are the

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
eight that I could think of at the time.

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,360
Um and the and Idos had I have a list

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,400
somewhere where Idos has like a full

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
page of different kinds of fun. Um now

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
different kinds of experiences that

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
people are trying to get out of playing

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
the game. That's what a game designer is

107
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
trying to get. The only problem is that

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
the game designer doesn't actually

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,880
control that experience. The game

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
designer only gets to control the

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
mechanics.

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
Depending on what company you are, maybe

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
you have the title of game designer, but

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
you're also in charge of the art. you

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,120
know, you're also you're actually also

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,639
the lead programmer. It's possible uh

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
that you also have more control over

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
things than just the mechanics, but most

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,320
designers mechanics is where is what

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,960
their job scope is. Um so they they

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,720
write the the the the rules, the rules

122
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
interact in some sort of like

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,639
ridiculously hard to predict way and

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
then you get the experience of playing

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
the game with the aesthetic and you hope

126
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,560
that's what you were going for. It

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,680
usually isn't. and uh and you you know

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,440
and then you make a change to the

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
mechanics try again and the nice thing

130
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,040
about that is that that works really

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
well with iterative design. Um in fact

132
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,400
without iterative design it becomes

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,759
really hard to control this entire

134
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,800
process because basically um you're

135
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,479
you're two orders removed from the

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,440
experience that you're trying to create.

137
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,160
It's like, you know, um trying to draw

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,520
on a piece of paper where uh not only

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
can you not see the paper that you're

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,479
drawing on, uh you're also, you know,

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
controlling the brush or the pencil, you

142
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,960
know, tied to a stick or something like

143
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,479
that life of it. That's kind of what

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,680
being a game design is like. Um

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,240
so, so that's the experience of the game

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,000
design side. Uh you get to control the

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
mechanics and you're going for some sort

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,919
of aesthetic. And on the other side, the

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,800
player is experiencing kind some kind of

150
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,800
aesthetic and you know, and they can

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
sort of work their way back. Um, you

152
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
know, it's like, I'm getting this kind

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,919
of experience. Um, why am I getting this

154
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,320
kind of experience? You know, if you got

155
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,000
a particularly insightful game player,

156
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,680
maybe you're taking CMS 300,

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
introduction to video game, and you're

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
analyzing games. Um, and you're trying

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,919
to say, how did we get here? And, and

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,199
you know, if you're taking this class,

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
you're going to be doing that a lot. You

162
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,680
know this game, Heroes Might Magic 3 for

163
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,720
instance, you know, you know, uh has

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
give me a particularly, you know, a a

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
sensation. Describe a sensation that you

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,039
got when you were playing that game that

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,240
that you recall

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,120
>> strategic, outsmarting, playing friends,

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,560
outsmart them.

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
>> So, so, so it made you feel smart. It

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
made you have to think really really

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
hard and everything. So and then you

173
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,520
think about what dynamics might have

174
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
resulted in that you know what what sort

175
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,199
of

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
>> fog of war

177
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,120
>> huh f fog of war you have to figure out

178
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
what what is behind the areas you can't

179
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,919
see. Yeah,

180
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,240
>> but there's some information that you

181
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,800
can see that may give you clues. And

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
then you know might actually be be

183
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
already a mechanic. But you know the

184
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
idea of there is information that you

185
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,479
can deduce even though you can't

186
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,319
actually see it. And there's some

187
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,039
probability

188
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,680
of getting it right uh based on your

189
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,560
experience with game. Fall war being one

190
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,919
to uh one one game mechanic that gets

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,880
you there. So you can sort of analyze it

192
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,400
backwards and uh figure out okay that's

193
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
one thing for war gets you. Sometimes

194
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,840
fog of war just confuses people, right?

195
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
That there could be anything behind this

196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,120
corner. I mean, technically Final

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,720
Fantasy random combat system is like fog

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
of war, right? I don't know if there's a

199
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,199
random encounter here. I will walk into

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,000
it and then oh look, there's slime

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,400
slimes at Dragon Quest. Um, Final

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Fantasy 10 slimes, I think.

203
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,080
>> Were you in Final Fantasy?

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,080
>> The Square Enix version is complet.

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,639
>> Mhm. FL. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You are

206
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,680
fighting cake.

207
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,280
Um but there is actually a problem.

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
Actually I I don't need to write this

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,160
down that there is a problem with um

210
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,840
well it means no problem. There is an

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
issue that I have with formal abstract

212
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,720
design tools and come to the word

213
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,599
formal. Um Doug Church uses it

214
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
specifically to say well it should be

215
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,240
sort of serious business right? You know

216
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,919
it's formal with a capital F. We're not

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
talking about how cool this game is. You

218
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,039
know, we want to be very precise in our

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,400
vocabulary. We want to be um you know,

220
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,319
we want to treat it like this because

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,080
that's capital that's capital B.

222
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
However,

223
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,080
that the other assumption with the word

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,640
formal comes from formalism. You you are

225
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
thinking about the form of the game in a

226
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,440
way that if you were trying to apply the

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
same technique to talk about art, you'd

228
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,719
be talking about the form of visual art,

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,200
you know, the form of cinema. Um and uh

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,279
and that is actually a fairly narrow way

231
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,279
to look at something which at a topic

232
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,800
that's as broad as a game. Um you are

233
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,399
you know it is as if

234
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,399
as if we were trying to analyze

235
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,120
something like like life heroes might

236
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,640
have met and completely ignoring your

237
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
the fact that you were playing it with

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
friends from French class. You know that

239
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
would be an example of well that had

240
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,640
nothing to do with the game. Well,

241
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,519
actually, it probably had a lot to do

242
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,480
with how you experience the game. Um,

243
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,160
you know, uh, you know, playing that's

244
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,920
the rules of chess. There's, uh, and and

245
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,839
you could just look at the game based on

246
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,600
this rules of the rules of chess. You

247
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
could also look at the history of chess.

248
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
You could also look at who you're

249
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
playing it against. Are you playing

250
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,839
against random person or against a dad?

251
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,839
You know, uh, big difference. Uh, uh, or

252
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,920
in my case, my mom. Um, are you uh, you

253
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,560
know, playing it in a club? Are you

254
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,680
playing it, you know, against the chess

255
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,480
master in in the cupboard square or

256
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,800
something like that? Um,

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,200
uh, what what does this game mean? I are

258
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,360
you using the game metaphorically in in

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,800
speech or, you know, just saying and and

260
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,880
and I had, you know, and and my opponent

261
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,760
was in a checkmated

262
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,240
uh, position. does it necessarily mean

263
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
that you were playing chess with your

264
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
with with someone someone else in order

265
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
to get that point across. Um there's a

266
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
whole range of different ways that you

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
can look at games even as a game

268
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
designer that isn't specifically

269
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
formless that isn't specifically just

270
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
look just looking at the form of the

271
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
game. Um

272
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,640
just understanding what context people

273
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
are going to be playing the game in for.

274
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,160
So for a lot of the games that you guys

275
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,959
are going to be designing this semester

276
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,480
specifically uh in this class, you know,

277
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,079
you have to think about the fact that a

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,079
lot of these games are actually going to

279
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,399
be played by your instructors uh are

280
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
going to be played uh in a setting very

281
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,040
similar to this by your colleagues in

282
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
this room. Um are probably going to end

283
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,399
up being tested by dorm mates, you know,

284
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,760
fraternity f uh friends, uh folks around

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,279
campus. And all that is going to heavily

286
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,600
influence the kind of game that you

287
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,920
make. Um,

288
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,079
now for for better or worse, you know,

289
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
you are pretty much making a game for an

290
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,760
MIT audience. And we're trying to change

291
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
that a little bit uh for the last

292
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,560
assignment, but uh keep in mind that,

293
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,079
you know, you have to be uh that that's

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
not necessarily every single game that

295
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,200
you're going to make in the future and

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,560
that shouldn't be. But knowing that you

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,000
can try to cater to the audience that

298
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,720
you've got for every round. um that has

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,320
very little I mean in some ways this is

300
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
going to affect the design decisions

301
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,240
that you make in your game. What will be

302
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,320
perfectly acceptable to a uh a

303
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,640
competitive MIT audience might not be

304
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,800
perfectly acceptable to your average

305
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,120
board game buyer in Target or something

306
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,000
like that um and vice versa. Um, and so

307
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,480
what may be a perfectly engrossing game

308
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
mechanic, dynamic, aesthetic experience

309
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,480
that you will get, but just by looking

310
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,200
at a formal aspects of a game, you know,

311
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,519
this this will be really cool if you

312
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,600
understood the mechanic, played it out

313
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,480
in the way that create a desired dynamic

314
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,320
to give you the aesthetic experience.

315
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
But if you're if you don't understand

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,639
the context that you're playing the

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,720
game, as an example, then uh your player

318
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,480
may not even get that part. Your players

319
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,880
may may may look at your game say this

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:20,320
game is not for me. Yeah. Uh and just

321
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,959
walk away. Um it might mean that uh you

322
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,639
might I I'm thinking of things like uh

323
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,079
we we just had this discussion over

324
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,240
lunch about social games that you find

325
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,279
on Facebook for instance. Um and a lot

326
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,120
of social games I might have already

327
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
made this point but it has been argued

328
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,480
that social games aren't all that

329
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,480
social. All you do is really beg and

330
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,680
spam your friends. Uh that's the whole

331
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,920
point of playing. But in many ways, it's

332
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
also saying to your friends, we're kind

333
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,200
of doing the same thing. You know, we

334
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,800
may be separated by time and separated

335
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,519
by distance, but we're all doing the

336
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,920
same thing. And we we could be playing

337
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,040
this game. We could be talking about the

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,720
show that we that that that that we are

339
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,519
watching in our own apartments, but then

340
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,920
we get to discuss it. But in many ways,

341
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
this is just me telling you we're doing

342
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,519
the same thing that we're part of the

343
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,000
same group. And that serves a function

344
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,680
that has almost that that really doesn't

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,959
have anything to do with the formal

346
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,920
analysis of how a game mechanic works.

347
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,440
Um but it's still incredibly crucial to

348
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,480
the popularity of these games. So uh so

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,639
that so so so keep that in mind that um

350
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,360
even DJ makes this point but I think a

351
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,760
lot of uh designers actually kind of

352
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,399
ignore that when they read his his essay

353
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,639
that it's only one set of tools. the the

354
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,639
formal tools are only one set of tools.

355
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,839
Even uh there are tools uh at looking at

356
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:50,560
games culturally, personally

357
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,399
um uh and uh and other things that that

358
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,800
that that you may get in this class and

359
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,800
in classes like like CNS 300 um uh that

360
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
that that will affect it how people

361
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,600
experience the game and how much

362
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,279
pleasure that that they're running at

363
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,839
the game to understand whether your game

364
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,279
is doing what it does, right?

365
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,320
um that aren't that don't have anything

366
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,120
to do necessarily with just by looking

367
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,480
at the self-contained system of the of

368
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,639
of the game.

369
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Just as a side note, um how many of you

370
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,399
folks have heard of the narrative versus

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,880
nudology debate?

372
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,160
How many of you are sick of this? Okay.

373
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,360
Okay.

374
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,760
Um, don't you I'm I'm sick of it too,

375
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,000
but I bring it up for one reason that I

376
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,279
there is an interesting case that if you

377
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,480
actually look at narrat marintology as a

378
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,800
study and nudology as a study, they're

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,160
both formalist studies. And in fact,

380
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,680
they're more accurate than more more

381
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,040
precise. They're both structuralist,

382
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,959
which is kind of if you look at at at at

383
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
philosophies, it's kind of a subset of

384
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
formalism or at least a more recent

385
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,199
version of of of it. They're both

386
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,920
basically focused on these are the

387
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,680
elements of this art form and this is

388
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,320
how they interact to produce some sort

389
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,680
of effect. Um, and all that matters is

390
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
what's contained in this art form.

391
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,279
What's outside this art form doesn't

392
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,959
matter. That's what narratology does for

393
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,480
stories. That's what dudology does for

394
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,320
games. Um, and uh, that's in fact

395
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
probably why most people who study games

396
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
have kind of walked away from from from

397
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
ludology because it's not that

398
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,279
interesting to just study what's inside

399
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,440
the system. People want to see what's

400
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,800
outside. Um, and uh, so when you compare

401
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
structuralistic and structural

402
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,160
structuralism wins, that's that that's

403
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,000
one case. Um, and uh, you only have a

404
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,440
and and you may not realize that you're

405
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,320
actually looking at your game through a

406
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,759
very very narrow lens. So try to broaden

407
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,199
the range of tools that you've got. You

408
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,639
know, this this class is going to give

409
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,360
you a small set of them. Uh and it's not

410
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,759
by by any means the beyond and all of

411
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,000
every single way that you can look at it

412
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,600
at at the game. And again, they're not

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,199
they're not just restricted to the tools

414
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,680
that we're specifically teaching you in

415
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,279
this class. So keep so keep looking out

416
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,839
for new ones. Um

417
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:19,079
>> let's see.

418
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,079
Any questions so far? That was my rant.

419
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,120
10 10 minute rant. 15 minutes. Okay. All

420
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,519
right. No more ranting.

421
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,120
All right. We have a uh activity and do

422
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,519
you want to run through?

423
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,040
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um Okay. So, I'm going to

424
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,680
pass around. This is um my crappy race

425
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,199
game. So, you're going to need one one

426
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,759
copy per pair. Um, there's also some

427
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,639
nifty set of dice. You need one copy per

428
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,399
or one dye per character

429
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,120
on

430
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,120
I just aside.

431
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,519
>> And then um each person is going to need

432
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:03,880
three of these poker chips. It doesn't

433
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,880
matter what color. So just grab three.

434
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
>> Um, and then you're going to need a

435
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,799
marker to indicate yourself. And I

436
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,799
recommend just grabbing any

437
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,799
[Music]

438
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,799
>> copies.

439
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,039
You only need one per

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,760
Jason.

441
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
>> So,

442
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,520
>> one d for every two people.

443
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,320
>> Yeah. One of the six-sided die for every

444
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,080
two.

445
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
>> And then you need markers for yourselves

446
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
and then bonus markers. And that's what

447
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
the poker chips are for.

448
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
>> So, keep the keep the poker chips

449
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,200
circulating.

450
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
>> Three per person.

451
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,919
>> Three per person.

452
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,559
>> One piece per person.

453
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,039
>> Okay. You can use coins. You can use D

454
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,760
likeid

455
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,760
paper. Whatever you want.

456
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,799
I'm a maker with a penny and a crown.

457
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,400
>> So, we have three of these.

458
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,400
>> Most people.

459
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,080
>> How many? Take that.

460
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,080
>> If you need markers for yourself, you

461
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,080
can try one of the multi-sided

462
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,080
polyhedral.

463
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,919
[Music]

464
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,480
>> Okay. Okay. What now? have what now?

465
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,480
>> Okay, I should have used this.

466
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,200
>> I'm more well versed in the person.

467
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,360
>> I can see defeat.

468
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
>> Is that even correcting?

469
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,039
>> I think you're going to have to die.

470
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,039
>> The direct.

471
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,200
>> Okay. So, can everyone hold for a

472
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,880
second? So, what we're going to ask you

473
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
to do is just play through this game a

474
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,080
couple times. Um, then we're going to

475
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
come back and kind of apply the MGA

476
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
framework to the game itself and then if

477
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,480
we have time, I think we're going to

478
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,000
spend some time tweaking it. Yeah. Okay,

479
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,000
cool. So, we'll interrupt you in

480
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
probably

481
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,320
>> uh

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,640
actually 10 minutes. It's a pretty

483
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
>> uh Okay. So, I mean

484
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
>> this is sort of on the fly.

485
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,840
>> Yeah. So, so what we what we kind of

486
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
like to do is hear about I guess we'll

487
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,880
just go around the room in pairs and you

488
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,679
guys can talk or do you want a minute to

489
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,200
talk to apply MTA to this and kind of

490
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
something so I'm not like calling on you

491
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,240
on the spot.

492
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,160
>> Anybody wonder what how they felt what

493
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,360
the aesthetic of this game?

494
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,080
>> There is none.

495
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,080
>> People were pretty loud for their

496
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
crappy race game.

497
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
>> It felt competitive.

498
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,760
>> Well, the thing is it's like very simple

499
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,799
aesthetic. So, so in the paper they say

500
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,919
you're going to go straight like the

501
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,360
player should be using the aesthetic,

502
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,039
but here you go straight to the mechanic

503
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,679
and you're wondering about it.

504
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,360
>> Yeah, I mean the you definitely is easy

505
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,720
especially for board games because the

506
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,520
mechanics are written down right in

507
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,880
front of you is really judge. But how

508
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,600
did you feel while you were playing

509
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
this? I

510
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,799
>> think there was a there was a sense of

511
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:29,360
tension. There was maybe a sense of

512
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,640
brinkmanship perhaps.

513
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,159
There was a a sense of

514
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,000
um I mean

515
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
like there was the intellectual

516
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,360
challenge of working out like like is

517
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,080
there really a meaningful decision to be

518
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,200
made here

519
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,960
and if there is like what is what is the

520
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,120
correct decision?

521
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,919
>> Um

522
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,919
>> so so so just put put opinion in the

523
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
mind of like can can I optimize this?

524
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,080
Yeah. Yeah.

525
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,760
>> Especially for this crowd. I think this

526
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,679
is immediate.

527
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,640
Can I figure out what's the right way to

528
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,200
play this?

529
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,400
>> And and I know you tried to figure it

530
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,159
out.

531
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,960
>> I think I think he I think he correct.

532
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
>> He figured it out.

533
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
>> Yeah.

534
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,799
>> So, what's So, is there an optimal way

535
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,840
to play this game?

536
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,159
>> Yeah. Okay. So, if you're losing, you're

537
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,520
going to if you keep putting tokens

538
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,360
down, you're going to lose anyway. So,

539
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,799
you want to be rolling in order to like

540
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,960
increase the variance. Um, and if you're

541
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,640
winning, you want to be putting tokens

542
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,760
down in order to remove the variance.

543
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
You can imagine it as like a

544
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,840
distribution. Whereas, if you're like

545
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,600
below uh if you're like below the

546
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
winning line, you want to like widen it

547
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
out as much as possible. So, as much of

548
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
that distribution is above the winning

549
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
line. And if you're above the winning

550
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
line, you want to be as narrow as

551
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
possible. So, you stay above the

552
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,559
winning.

553
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
>> So, your strategy is basically based on

554
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
what's what's the current state of the

555
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,159
game.

556
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,679
>> Yeah. until like the last turn where

557
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,880
obviously you don't want to put a token

558
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,919
down if you're two from the end. Um like

559
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,000
as long as no one can win on this turn.

560
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,679
If I'm behind him, I'm putting down a

561
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,799
I'm rolling the die and if I'm ahead of

562
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,679
him, I'm putting down a token.

563
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,360
>> Did anyone like prefer a strategy before

564
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,000
you started thinking about what was the

565
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,760
best or

566
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,360
>> So I was too lazy to use a token, so I

567
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,600
would just keep rolling.

568
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,600
>> That's right. That's and that but that's

569
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,320
also part of the aesthetic of it, right?

570
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,840
It's like you just happen to prefer.

571
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,960
>> Yeah. Well, in the first six spaces, I

572
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,880
mean, you should have got the average if

573
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,400
you were all the same. If you put the

574
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,120
token down, I personally like being

575
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
conservative.

576
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,360
>> True.

577
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,159
>> See, and so that's

578
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
>> Sorry. Go ahead.

579
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
>> That is more exciting because it does

580
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,880
different things.

581
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,880
>> The token the illusion that you're

582
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,880
actually

583
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
>> Did anyone like get to a situation where

584
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
like really far behind and just like

585
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,360
caught up?

586
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,360
>> No. quickly.

587
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,320
>> Yeah.

588
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,840
>> Right. Like the actual difference, one

589
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,360
of the things that you do get in this

590
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,240
game is sort of perceived distance

591
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,960
between players is actually, you know,

592
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,440
not that not that far. If what if if the

593
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,799
one behind actually has has to do with

594
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
it then uh I think people refer to this

595
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
as the American Gladiators effect.

596
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,880
>> Yeah.

597
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,679
>> Um you know how like American Gladiators

598
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,640
you uh uh actually is this your example

599
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,760
that I'm stealing here?

600
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,559
>> I don't remember.

601
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
>> Okay. Honestly,

602
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,240
>> this someone's example that I'm stealing

603
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
but

604
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,720
>> I think it's in the book at some point

605
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,280
but I think we had applied it to

606
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,760
>> Yes. Yes. Uh well, I'm crediting someone

607
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,720
for this, but

608
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,039
I wish I

609
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,960
citation. Um so yeah, uh the the the

610
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:51,520
basic idea being you know if who's who's

611
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,159
seen American Gladiators or um

612
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,159
>> it might be too old.

613
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
>> I've never heard I don't know what it

614
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
is.

615
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,320
>> Okay. Okay. Um there also a number of

616
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,400
different like Japanese game shows which

617
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
are kind of similar.

618
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,559
Did you guys seen Japanese game trips?

619
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,080
>> Yeah. The basic idea in American

620
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,960
Gladiators is that it's basically an

621
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,039
obstacle course where the obstacles are

622
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,440
uh h happen to be kind of these like

623
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,520
athletic dudes and women who have um who

624
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,200
are either pummeling you with buffer

625
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,200
sticks or like shooting tennis balls at

626
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,559
you gun and stuff like that. And you

627
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
basically have to get from the beginning

628
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,559
to to the end faster than the other

629
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,240
teams. Actually faster than than the

630
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,000
other players. So, it's two regular

631
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,120
dudes, a bunch a whole bunch of athletes

632
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,640
who are throwing things at you.

633
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,039
Every time you get a kid, you have to go

634
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,600
back a little bit. But the thing about

635
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,279
the the thing about American Gladiators

636
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,440
is that so you have this long obstacle

637
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,880
course. In fact, this was one of the

638
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,760
events. This was always the final event

639
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,799
of the entire uh of the entire TV show

640
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,640
is that um you will you will have two

641
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,320
people doing the same course. They would

642
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,520
have to climb up a wall and then they

643
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,240
will have to go down um uh flying fast a

644
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,840
net. Yeah.

645
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
>> But it was it was like a cargo net

646
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,480
specifically. So it was really difficult

647
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
to climb up it.

648
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,240
>> Yeah. It's like this big webbing kind of

649
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,159
thing. If you ever try and it's like

650
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
climbing the rigging of a ship, right?

651
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,080
You know, it's like really really

652
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,720
difficult your feet.

653
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,760
So what happens is that you know you if

654
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,600
you have two people who are really

655
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,520
really far apart one one person way

656
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,200
ahead and that person starts climbing

657
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
the cargo net it takes that person

658
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,400
forever to get to the end of the car

659
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,320
coconut because climbing up cargo net is

660
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
really really hard no matter who you are

661
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,960
that gives the person behind plenty of

662
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,000
time to catch up uh and start climbing

663
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,440
the cargo net. Um but then that the

664
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
person who wasn't the lead in the first

665
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
place hits the zipline and all of a

666
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,679
sudden there's a huge increase of

667
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,200
distance. Um so that this whole idea

668
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,720
that they never really were all that far

669
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,240
uh they they never really changed their

670
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,320
position for most for most uh uh

671
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,159
gladiators games. They the the winner

672
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,520
has already been decided by that point

673
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
because first person who reaches the

674
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,200
cargo net tends to win to tends to win

675
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,440
the match. But it looks like the lead

676
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,400
just shrank because suddenly you got

677
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,640
both of them in one camera shot. Um, and

678
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,880
then you get that huge huge relief that

679
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,720
that Mark likes to call that dramatic

680
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,240
tension, which I think is a better

681
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,840
description than his other term for the

682
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,760
same thing, which is drama, because it's

683
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,520
not drama. It's just tension release. Um

684
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,120
but uh but that's an aesthetic, you

685
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,679
know, going for that aesthetic of

686
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,440
tension and coming up with a game that

687
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,080
makes you feel like a price is closer

688
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,760
than it actually is or you know uh or

689
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,880
allowing someone to close the gap really

690
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,480
really quick quickly because as many of

691
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,159
you have pointed out these things

692
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,600
probabilistically mean exactly the same

693
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:50,960
thing as a di um

694
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,559
let's see um so that's you know but the

695
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,039
the the ability to, you know, increase a

696
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,360
for for a gap to to to open up and then

697
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,440
to close. That's actually a dynamic

698
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,039
that's actually a result of a number of

699
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,400
different rules that are in this

700
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,080
particular game. And um it's not written

701
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,840
down that that's going to happen, but

702
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,360
it's pretty much going to happen if you

703
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,799
have two people playing those particular

704
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,799
strategies. And it's one thing that

705
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:21,480
happens pretty often. Um so yeah, that's

706
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,480
so that's one to keep in mind. Um

707
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,679
What are the constraints that you're

708
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,279
seeing uh in the design of this game

709
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,840
here? Like like what what was this game

710
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,679
what what does this game have to do in

711
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
order for it to be a viable in-class

712
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,679
exercise?

713
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,360
>> Fit on a sheet of paper.

714
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,919
>> Fit on a sheet of paper. That's a huge

715
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,799
one actually. Uh because first of all

716
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,559
limits how many spaces you've got

717
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,440
assuming everyone's using like something

718
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,520
this size or a coin or something. Uh,

719
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,679
>> you mean you can I mean you can laugh at

720
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,200
that, but that's literally how it went

721
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,200
is I wanted it to fit on a sheet of

722
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,399
paper and the spaces had to accommodate

723
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,279
a die. So the number of spaces is a

724
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,880
result of that.

725
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,880
>> So 12 was an accident.

726
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,880
>> Yeah,

727
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,679
but you probably could have fit the

728
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,039
square, but you know some margins.

729
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,559
>> Yeah, it's hard. Um,

730
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,159
see the rules have to fit on one sheet

731
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,840
of paper as well. So the rules can't be

732
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,240
that complicated.

733
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,240
>> Yep. Um most of these rules are single

734
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,840
sentences for the most part. Uh it's

735
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,320
just that because the college are so

736
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,799
small they look really much complicated.

737
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,799
>> Um

738
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,799
>> it had to be quick. It had to work for

739
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,640
10 minutes. Uh in fact it had to work so

740
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,960
that you could get a few games hopefully

741
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,720
through within 10 minutes. Anyone only

742
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,120
managed to get through?

743
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,120
>> Yeah. Okay. that being really hard.

744
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:59,919
>> So, so different aesthetics.

745
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,760
Um so you know this this game tries to

746
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,520
get it like really really tense but you

747
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,559
know obviously the decision that you're

748
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,320
actually making in this game you know is

749
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,720
minimal that you you do get to to say

750
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,039
well if you are already losing then

751
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,600
there's really only one r one one one

752
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,760
rational thing to do but if you were

753
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,039
playing this game as Jason recommended

754
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,640
if I was playing this game against

755
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,320
myself you know there really is no

756
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,520
optimal strategy I could pick two

757
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,360
different strategies for each side and

758
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
because then who plays first basically.

759
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,559
>> Yeah.

760
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,520
>> Person who plays first is by default on

761
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,200
on average. Um

762
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,880
and depending

763
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
game but one

764
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,640
>> I'm bad at rolling dice because if

765
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,720
you're rolling out right you could it

766
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,600
could be bad.

767
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
>> So um I would like actually folks to uh

768
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,480
try mixing this up a little bit. You

769
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,080
know pick a rule in here any rule uh and

770
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,399
uh and alter it. you know either you can

771
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,399
do things like adding more squares you

772
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,480
can change the movement chart uh

773
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,480
one idea that I had and someone who's

774
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,799
taken probability more recent than me

775
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
which is uh what happens if you use the

776
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,120
high of two dice rolls instead of just

777
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,039
one uh you know because dashing just a

778
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:19,679
probability and uh play around with that

779
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,919
um see what that feels like and uh and

780
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,279
if that feels just boring

781
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,080
cash need something else. So, um we've

782
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,880
got 15 minutes.

783
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,799
>> Yeah, it's reasonable.

784
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,240
>> Yeah. And then and then you know and

785
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,840
then you'll tell you'll tell the class

786
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,919
about what you changed and how that

787
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,240
changed the feeling you made.

788
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,520
>> Cool.

789
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,600
>> So, every two people uh uh work with the

790
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,720
the team next to you, explain how your

791
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,200
game how your version works uh and have

792
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,760
the other group play it. Um and what and

793
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,159
what I'm going to do after every um and

794
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,559
vice versa and what what what we're

795
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,840
going to do once everyone's done this is

796
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,360
you tell u you will have tell the class

797
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,520
what you felt that game well the the

798
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,520
other group's game felt like. So let

799
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,080
someone else figure out what your game

800
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,279
is.

801
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,320
>> Cool.

802
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:16,159
>> So uh does uh any team want to just go

803
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,640
first describe the the other teams? Um,

804
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
>> okay. That's studying with you.

805
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
>> Do you want to like describe the rules

806
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,039
they changed?

807
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
>> Uh, sure.

808
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,120
>> Just like So,

809
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,039
>> uh, the the the main change in this

810
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,960
version was that it's modular, so you

811
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,679
have to land exactly on the end or

812
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,520
otherwise you wrap around.

813
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
It it changed the aesthetic a lot

814
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,039
because it stopped being like a race

815
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,519
against your opponent and it became more

816
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,440
of like a a trying to figure out how you

817
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,440
can use your tokens to like precision

818
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,159
just hit the end.

819
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,840
>> Very mathematical. like uh methodical

820
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,039
you just like you decided whether or not

821
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,440
you're going to stock those things give

822
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,960
you more like winning squares and then

823
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
you just waited until you landed on a

824
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,039
winning square.

825
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,159
>> So you get into this computational

826
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,440
model.

827
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,799
>> Yeah. It's not it's not as like

828
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,960
competitive.

829
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,720
>> So one of the discussions we had was if

830
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,159
you had three tokens you would just get

831
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
to the end because we made our token so

832
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,679
you move four spaces.

833
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,880
>> Okay.

834
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,159
>> But I just realized you have to do the

835
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,039
die roll after that.

836
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
>> Yeah.

837
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
>> So automatically

838
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,640
>> Oh yeah.

839
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,799
>> Okay. Anyway,

840
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,600
uh let's see.

841
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,200
>> Yeah. So, they had a really creative

842
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,799
rule where they had a a d10 here. So, if

843
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
it goes from 0 to 9 and you roll it

844
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,760
under a cup and that's the number of

845
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,880
spaces away from the end. So, from 0 to

846
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,320
9 that the winning point is okay.

847
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,559
>> And in your turn, you can either play

848
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,240
normally or you can check to see where

849
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,240
the winning point is. If you've won,

850
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,080
that triggers you winning, but you

851
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,039
cannot win until you physically check

852
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,600
and confirm that you've won.

853
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,519
So, it eats up a turn, but it could be

854
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,240
that after one roll like or two rolls of

855
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,480
two and if this was a nine, you've won.

856
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,080
And and so there's there's and that was

857
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
a lot of fun basically because we had

858
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,080
yet figured out the optimal strategy,

859
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
but it was just fun. Yeah, it was.

860
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,080
>> So, so what's it feel like when you're

861
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,320
like when you're trying to figure out

862
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,240
what you're going to do? He's beat me by

863
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,240
checking when it was far away and being

864
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,240
lucky.

865
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,559
>> So if you don't check, you have to reach

866
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,799
the end to win. So you have to check

867
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,960
usually anyway in that game.

868
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,120
>> So So one thing we wish I had in mind

869
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,720
when we were thinking about the rule was

870
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,320
that there ought to be information that

871
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,039
you can get from how your opponent

872
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,640
reacts after they look under the cup. So

873
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,320
like if they then go and start rolling

874
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,840
again or what have you or they then like

875
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
stop file shift some I don't know.

876
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,279
>> Well I mean obviously

877
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,799
>> but there must be an abil some way that

878
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,799
you can get leaked information from

879
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,159
their behavior which makes it kind of

880
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,080
interesting in a different way.

881
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,919
>> If you have already seen the cup and you

882
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,720
get past the point do you have to check

883
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,960
to win?

884
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
>> Yeah.

885
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,559
>> Yeah. There are we there are two

886
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,519
different variants. One way you didn't.

887
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,880
>> Oh I see.

888
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,320
>> Well you don't have to check the second

889
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,919
time. If you check the first time then

890
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,840
you pass it. You win.

891
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,120
>> So that's one way of playing.

892
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,480
>> Okay. So the person who checks could win

893
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,519
even if both of them have passed the

894
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,679
point. Am I understand?

895
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,679
>> Well, so if he's the first pass a point,

896
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,679
the way that we're doing is if if you

897
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,119
don't have to check to fit to win. So if

898
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
you just need the knowledge of what the

899
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,679
end point is, then if he passes it

900
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,200
first, he wins. If when he checks both

901
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,919
players are at that spot, then it's a

902
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,879
tie.

903
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,560
>> Okay. Um, but since it's a sequential

904
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,839
game, it's impossible other than at the

905
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,119
moment of the check, if both players are

906
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,639
at the same spot, it's impossible for

907
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,839
them to hand out at the same time. So,

908
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,919
that's not really an issue.

909
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,599
>> What if I check and you're past me and

910
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,720
you have passed the checks part?

911
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,359
>> I don't win.

912
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,040
>> Okay.

913
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,320
>> I never checked. So, as long as I don't

914
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,320
know, I don't win.

915
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,560
>> That immediately makes me think of a

916
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:51,440
different variant. Okay. Okay. Cool. Um,

917
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,280
so what they did was they had it they

918
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,839
introduced a couple new rules. The first

919
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,599
rule being that the person who rolls

920
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,240
first on their first turn, they cannot

921
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,720
put down a token. So they actually have

922
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,280
to roll. The second rule is whenever you

923
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,359
roll, if you have a bonus, a token on

924
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,040
the stockpile, you have two options

925
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,119
after you roll. One is you can take it

926
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,800
off and move two spaces like normal. The

927
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,960
second is you can choose to make that

928
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,839
block impassible. And so what this does

929
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,359
is you cannot your opponent cannot land

930
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,520
on that block. If they are already on

931
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,839
that block, they get pushed one uh block

932
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,680
back. If they are behind it, they and

933
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,599
they roll and they move to that block,

934
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,280
they get pushed one block behind it.

935
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,599
>> So they're changing the map while you're

936
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,079
playing.

937
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,520
>> Yes.

938
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,320
>> And and how that feels while you're

939
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,200
actually playing.

940
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,200
>> We didn't actually use that much.

941
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,359
>> It felt like a rule.

942
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,040
I felt like the penalty for the impassel

943
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,320
block should have been more because if

944
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,000
you land on the block that they're on

945
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,119
and make them move back one, that token

946
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,160
would otherwise have made you move

947
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,520
forward too.

948
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,440
>> So, it doesn't really reward you for

949
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,520
that. I feel like if it had if it could

950
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,119
have been really awesome uh if the

951
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,040
penalty was like significantly more

952
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,560
severe because it's hard to like get in

953
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,359
front of them enough

954
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,760
>> to actually make a block impassible and

955
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,320
have them land on it later.

956
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,839
>> Um

957
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,079
>> Oh, all the way back or something.

958
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,079
>> Yeah.

959
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,440
>> Yeah, exactly. So yeah, you know, try

960
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,440
multiplying it by two and see what

961
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
happens.

962
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,560
>> You just go too forward.

963
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,240
>> Yeah. Yeah. And then you're not always

964
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,880
going to land on it.

965
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,160
>> Yeah. If if if you're like hm that

966
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,839
should have changed the game play, but

967
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,599
that didn't one the one one one of the

968
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,440
tricks in chapter one was, you know,

969
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,960
just multi just make it bigger and see

970
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,240
what happens. you know, if nothing else,

971
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,680
it will it will just give you more

972
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,119
information on you know, whether you

973
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,880
should be spending any more time with

974
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,320
this direction uh or whether it uh you

975
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,680
know, it really isn't going to affect

976
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,400
the way how people play because people

977
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,000
don't end up caring a lot. Uh so the

978
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,839
rule of two is just like multiply

979
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,760
something by two or half it by two and

980
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,640
see what happens. Um obviously hopping

981
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,720
by two will not take so long. Okay, who

982
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,640
else?

983
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
So essentially they had these tokens as

984
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,040
powerups

985
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,359
>> and you would never actually take them

986
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,359
off to move more spaces. You would just

987
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,280
keep adding tokens and you could roll.

988
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,160
So you could spend one turn to put a

989
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,119
token on

990
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,079
>> and then uh consequent rolls you could

991
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,240
essentially say I have n tokens. So

992
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,560
therefore I roll n plus one dice and

993
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,800
subtract n.

994
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,520
>> N + one dice. So I have three tokens.

995
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,839
>> You roll and then you roll a dieice for

996
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,760
each token you have and then move back

997
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,160
one space for each token you have.

998
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
>> Interesting.

999
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,960
>> So it moves your average and your

1000
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,400
maximum up each time.

1001
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,200
>> So you could add tokens to power

1002
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,119
yourself up.

1003
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,440
>> And you could also remove tokens to take

1004
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,920
away tokens from the other guy, right?

1005
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,359
>> Yeah.

1006
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,079
>> Okay. So we never actually did it wrong.

1007
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh, one thing we didn't realize with uh

1008
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,640
they I guess we forgot to go over the

1009
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,400
fact that uh you don't take out all the

1010
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,599
tokens when you do your special move.

1011
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,119
They stay in there

1012
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,240
>> because mathematically speaking, if you

1013
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,240
take them all, it's just mov

1014
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,480
uh well that that that's an important

1015
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,960
object lesson in how to explain your

1016
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,000
rules to people, but you know uh how it

1017
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,880
feels there. Uh, it was it made my mind

1018
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,119
tired being like n + 1 minus n blah blah

1019
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,880
blah. But it was interesting. I actually

1020
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,640
used it. Like before I said that I would

1021
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
only use the D, but this time I actually

1022
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,720
use token.

1023
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,920
>> And what happens when you actually use

1024
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,079
the token? Was it like yes or

1025
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,240
>> like I said like the math made it too

1026
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,240
hard for me to actually

1027
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,480
>> Oh, something happened.

1028
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,760
>> Okay. Well, it made you use the tokens

1029
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,640
uh as opposed to

1030
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,800
>> interesting. Okay, cool. Who has any?

1031
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,040
Yeah. Jason.

1032
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,000
>> Uh, so the rule that they gave was that

1033
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,400
if you are behind the player, by by

1034
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,079
behind they mean if your token if if

1035
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
your piece is like behind the other one,

1036
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,760
not like

1037
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,920
>> in losing second place,

1038
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,920
>> right?

1039
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,119
>> But but not in the imaginary sense. in

1040
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,160
the well whatever

1041
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,960
>> if you're physically if you're

1042
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,720
physically behind

1043
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,040
>> if you're if you're physically behind

1044
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,040
them then when you use a token you get

1045
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,359
to move one extra space in it.

1046
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,079
>> Okay. Uh if you can't if you use two

1047
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,920
tokens you end up getting like one.

1048
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,599
>> So how so how that feel?

1049
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,359
>> Uh it actually changed the strategy a

1050
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,480
little bit because you know in the

1051
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,079
beginning you basically don't want to be

1052
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,119
the person who moves first because then

1053
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,720
your opponent can just use all their

1054
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,560
tokens and get a lot further ahead of

1055
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,440
you.

1056
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,640
>> Oh, I see.

1057
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,480
>> Interesting.

1058
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,480
>> Okay.

1059
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,680
Maybe you want to stockpile tokens and

1060
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,920
then wait for the other player to get

1061
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,160
ahead of you so that you can reuse them.

1062
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,680
You can

1063
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,960
>> then you just sit at the start line with

1064
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,839
three tokens.

1065
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,960
>> But then you're forced to roll.

1066
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,960
>> So pretty much the person can go second.

1067
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,480
>> So that's actually a negative feedback

1068
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,920
loop uh uh which we'll get to I guess in

1069
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,599
the next class. But you know the the

1070
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,520
whole idea being if there is a gap

1071
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
between players and you have game

1072
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,119
mechanics that specifically are designed

1073
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,720
to narrow the gap uh those are negative

1074
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,320
feedback loops. You know pretty much

1075
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,839
>> Mario Kart has

1076
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,599
>> Mario Kart blue shell is the other

1077
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,440
direction right is to knock back the the

1078
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,000
the person who's leading rather than

1079
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,440
helping you catch up. Um but actually a

1080
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,440
lot of Mario Kart's mechanics are

1081
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,119
basically designed trying to reduce the

1082
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,640
lead. All right cool. Um who has it on?

1083
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,400
>> Yeah. Um they added one rule keeping

1084
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,200
everything else equal. They added a

1085
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,720
second die and then the way it worked

1086
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,480
was you arbitrarily assign people odd or

1087
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,720
even numbers and then you roll to see

1088
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,560
who would go on that particular turn

1089
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,400
>> and then that person whoever it was

1090
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,240
assigned to would play and then you

1091
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,720
would roll again to see who went at the

1092
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,240
next turn and so forth and so forth.

1093
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,200
>> How feel?

1094
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,160
I got I got I got bad memories with

1095
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,560
Mario Kart. It's like what again?

1096
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,560
>> Boy like I I

1097
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,160
many mechanics I just described as very

1098
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,079
Mario Kart like phenomenon.

1099
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,880
>> Well, Mario Kart is actually a

1100
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,359
collection of a lot of fairly

1101
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,400
fundamental mechanics. But you know

1102
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,720
describe specific

1103
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,200
>> I felt like like just rolling to see who

1104
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,280
went like amplified

1105
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
the sense that you were just playing for

1106
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,760
luck.

1107
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,880
>> So it it amplified a randomness

1108
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,000
basically which which I actually detest

1109
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,839
personally.

1110
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,839
>> Well the original game

1111
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,440
>> yeah that rule is like the initiative

1112
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,240
rule in Star Wars miniatures and

1113
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,400
Dungeons and Dragons miniatures. Um, and

1114
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,240
like in that case where there's like

1115
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,760
actual strategic decisions to be made,

1116
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,280
then it's it's actually kind of cool

1117
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,800
because it means that you never know

1118
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,160
like whether you're going to be able to

1119
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,000
capitalize on the position that you were

1120
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
in at the end of the turn.

1121
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,200
>> That's exactly I was going to say it's

1122
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,319
like since we both know optimal strategy

1123
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,079
for the original game just

1124
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,319
>> if there was harder strategy.

1125
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,240
>> So it almost becomes like a a gambling

1126
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:55,040
game of chance.

1127
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,800
>> Cool. All right.

1128
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,880
They added uh different dice you could

1129
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,200
roll for different effects such as if

1130
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,000
you rolled the d20 you could uh go 10

1131
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,800
spaces if you manage to get a 17 18 19

1132
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,839
>> 18 1920

1133
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,960
>> or 18 1920. Yeah.

1134
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,520
>> Um and they added the d10 which also had

1135
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,760
similar effects and the d8. So Patrick

1136
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,760
and I pretty much experimented with well

1137
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,760
he just rolled the entire time

1138
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,200
>> and I experimented with rolling the d8

1139
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,160
from the d10

1140
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,400
>> and just choose which one you

1141
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,359
>> get and you use the d6 as well. Why

1142
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
would he not roll?

1143
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,319
>> Why would he not roll?

1144
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,280
>> Yeah, I started feeling impatient. Like

1145
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,119
I I I would forget everything about Alec

1146
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,760
and what he wanted to do. And every turn

1147
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,640
I would roll the d20 hoping to get 18,

1148
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,079
19 or 20.

1149
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,839
>> By the way, with the d20, if you don't

1150
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,319
roll any of those, you go zero spaces.

1151
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,359
So that's actually

1152
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,359
>> you could either win the game.

1153
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,480
>> I would roll the d20 waiting to get 18,

1154
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,640
1920. And not until I rolled the 1820.

1155
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,920
Would I care where he was on the board?

1156
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,599
>> You and you.

1157
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,480
>> It's just you and you and the random.

1158
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,280
>> I won like twice.

1159
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,560
>> No, I won twice, too.

1160
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,160
>> Equal chances,

1161
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,680
>> which which was slightly different. I

1162
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,960
mean, like what you described earlier is

1163
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,319
that, you know, whe whether you're

1164
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,319
behind or in front of someone changed

1165
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,480
the way that you play in the original

1166
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,000
version. This one now no longer really

1167
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,800
matters anymore, right? It is just you

1168
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,079
and the dice and and if the universe

1169
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
loves you, you would just automatically

1170
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,280
win.

1171
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,800
>> Well, the intention was to have the D20

1172
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,079
that if you were like way behind and the

1173
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,000
other ones if you were only slightly

1174
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,280
behind, but apparently that's not how it

1175
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,760
is.

1176
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,359
>> Well, we have iterative design, right?

1177
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,560
>> Well, it's a great example of the

1178
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,000
aesthetic you were going for, not

1179
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,640
necessarily being the aesthetic that was

1180
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,240
actually experienced. So, you know, uh

1181
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,599
it's still a powerful aesthetic. It's

1182
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,280
just a different thing that

1183
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,400
>> um I'm going to skip to you.

1184
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,680
>> Yeah. Sorry about that.

1185
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,119
>> Yeah. Uh so their new rule was

1186
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,800
um if you're physically ahead and you

1187
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,240
roll a six instead of only getting

1188
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,079
three, you go four.

1189
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,720
>> If you're physically ahead and you roll

1190
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,720
a six, you go.

1191
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,720
>> Okay.

1192
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,119
>> Exact opposite from

1193
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,359
>> Yeah. So at first we tried playing it in

1194
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,640
a similar way to how we did before and

1195
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,119
it really felt like the person who was

1196
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,720
ahead was ahead even more and it all

1197
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,400
everyone rolling because as soon as you

1198
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:32,720
roll you get a higher expectation value.

1199
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,280
>> So so you are more you you prefer to go

1200
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,760
for luck rather than the

1201
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,480
>> So the problem is if you put a token

1202
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,240
down

1203
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,920
>> then they're guarante they roll at least

1204
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,119
a one so you're guaranteably going to be

1205
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,839
behind and then they have a higher

1206
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,720
expectation. So, so but how how does it

1207
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,359
feel? I mean, sure, mathematically that

1208
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,280
that's what it means, but

1209
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,280
actually

1210
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,359
in play in the first game, I don't think

1211
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,240
it actually came up at all.

1212
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,000
>> So, and then in the second game,

1213
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,119
I believe it did. And

1214
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,119
>> yeah,

1215
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,480
>> I don't know. It to me it didn't really

1216
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,040
feel like it changed.

1217
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,280
>> I don't know. For me, the entire time I

1218
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,200
felt like the person who was head was

1219
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,720
more ahead.

1220
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,280
>> It would come up more if your board was

1221
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,599
longer.

1222
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,200
>> Yeah,

1223
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,480
>> cuz you're only encouraged to stockpile

1224
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,599
for the first few turns. But if you're

1225
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,119
encouraged more, then you switch.

1226
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,480
>> Even in games where no one rolled a six,

1227
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,200
do you feel like it changed your

1228
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,200
strategy?

1229
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,640
>> Yes.

1230
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,880
>> Yeah. It changed

1231
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,079
>> just it made rolling feel like a better

1232
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,400
engineer.

1233
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,520
So

1234
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,640
>> which was the which was the point,

1235
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
right? That was what you guys were

1236
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
aiming for.

1237
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,359
>> Yeah. The the alternate rule that we had

1238
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,599
toyed with uh was that if you are ahead

1239
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,040
and you put down a token, you have to

1240
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,960
roll and if you get a sick, you have to

1241
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,560
move one step back. So like a one in six

1242
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,160
chance of there being a penalty for a

1243
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,200
token because precisely what you

1244
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,040
mentioned which is that when you're

1245
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,560
ahead, the diamond strategy basically is

1246
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,680
to reduce the variance. So you're

1247
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,880
playing with stuff to make you want to

1248
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,960
roll more basically.

1249
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,240
>> So So okay. So,

1250
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,520
>> so dynamically that uh that that tell

1251
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,599
that that tell tells you ro more uh and

1252
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,839
uh I think I would say aesthetically you

1253
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,839
have the whole monopoly situation of the

1254
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,319
person who's winning keeps winning. Uh

1255
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,240
and that's you know there are times

1256
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,680
where you actually want that feeling. Uh

1257
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,280
especially when it came to the game of

1258
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,000
of monopoly the whole point of the game

1259
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,440
was huge financial imbalances and then

1260
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,640
it's like wow I have no money and I'm

1261
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,160
just going to keep losing money. That

1262
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,680
was the point of the game actually.

1263
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,440
That's why it's called an

1264
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,720
>> the amusing thing with that is that the

1265
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,400
person who's physically ahead might not

1266
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,000
actually be ahead in terms of in terms

1267
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,960
of absolute gameplay because he might

1268
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
have the other person may have

1269
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,720
stockpiled

1270
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
>> right

1271
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,440
>> uh tokens

1272
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,720
>> and and we weren't sure whether

1273
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,599
determining who was ahead by counting

1274
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,200
the tokens in the equation or not was a

1275
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,640
better game rule if we didn't have

1276
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,880
enough time to test.

1277
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,800
>> Give it a shot after test.

1278
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,000
Um, the one that we came up with was at

1279
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,839
first we thought it wouldn't change the

1280
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,079
game at all, I guess, which is basically

1281
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,920
instead of spending tokens to go forward

1282
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,000
two steps, you spend a token to knock

1283
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,040
your opponent back two steps

1284
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,280
>> and change the

1285
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,920
>> completely change the game play. I think

1286
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,359
other people we tried it really

1287
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,359
what happened is like you stockpile

1288
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,800
first and then you knock people back and

1289
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,800
so like you didn't go anywhere for the

1290
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,160
first like 10 turns and you realize that

1291
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,119
nothing was going to happen and we just

1292
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,800
kept rolling the rest of the time.

1293
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,599
Yeah, but but which is a completely

1294
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,119
different way to play the game. Yeah. Um

1295
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,280
that that that whole process of

1296
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,960
stockpiling right in the beginning is I

1297
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,400
mean sure we could have both started

1298
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,319
with a stack of three each because

1299
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,839
that's really what will happen three

1300
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:42,839
turns in but this but the whole act of

1301
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,839
like

1302
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,160
>> you know that that felt really like okay

1303
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,319
clearly you are setting up to kill me.

1304
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,800
Could

1305
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,200
you move the very start?

1306
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,000
>> Huh?

1307
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,240
>> Can you move?

1308
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,240
>> No. No. But we we we had it so that it

1309
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,079
wouldn't be any point spending it uh

1310
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,760
when you were right at the beginning.

1311
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:06,240
But but there was that whole arms race

1312
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,480
feel that we didn't have any game. Uh so

1313
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,079
uh we didn't but I mean it all it did

1314
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,560
really was make the game longer.

1315
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:16,079
>> Yeah.

1316
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,800
>> But it felt mean. Okay. Um that's pretty

1317
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,119
much it for today I guess. Yeah. So, uh,

1318
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,800
cool. And we need the poker chips and

1319
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,000
all the dice back, but you can keep the

1320
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,000
game boards really fast.

1321
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
>> Yes.

1322
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,720
>> How long did this game take you to take

1323
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,079
you to make?

1324
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:39,440
>> Um, it took longer to make the board

1325
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,800
than to make the rules.

1326
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,240
>> I illustrated going on.

1327
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,240
>> I know. It's a word document.
