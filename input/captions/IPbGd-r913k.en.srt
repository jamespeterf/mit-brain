1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, up next is Yuan Bolohan, vice

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,519
president of strategy and marketing at

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,240
well.inc, a digital health company using

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,359
AI and behavioral science to help

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,560
employees make smarter health decisions.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,400
Yuan will describe how Wells app helps

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
employees navigate their wellness

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,960
offerings, drawing on insights from the

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,960
gaming world to enhance health outcomes.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,640
He'll also share details of their

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,200
research collaboration which with HSI

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,440
which uses health analytics to improve

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,200
engagement. Yuan, the mic is yours.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,520
>> Great. Thanks for the introduction, Jim.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,480
Um, as Jim mentioned, I'm Yuan. I'm the

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
vice president of strategy at Well, and

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,360
uh we're based in Boston, North

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
Carolina. So, fortunately, I'm just a

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,600
stones throw from the MIT Sloan team. I

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,640
get to swing by from time to time. And

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,480
that's what we'll be talking a little

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
bit about today. uh our collaboration

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,719
with the MIT team and a bit more of a

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,439
background on our platform and our our

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,760
goals with the collaboration.

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,600
So to dive in, one of the core questions

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
that we're often faced in healthcare

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,280
navigation and wellness is why is

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,680
engagement so elusive? Knowledge is

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,400
available. It's plentiful. Um access has

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,159
expanded. And yet many people,

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
especially those who can benefit the

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
most from these types of solutions, are

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,240
not engaging. Behaviors aren't changing.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
And even if they do start, often that

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,960
engagement isn't sustained. Ultimately,

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
people want to follow the path of least

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
resistance. And that's really what we

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,920
have to identify is how to better inform

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,439
that path. So if we were to break down

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,360
the problem, we can think about

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,600
traditional versus modern consumer

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,680
engagement solutions. On the traditional

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
healthcare and benefits side, what do we

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
generally see? It's often limited

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,280
interactions. These are brief and

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,119
infrequent, um, often confusing. Adults

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
are seeing providers about one to three

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
times per year and almost half of

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,360
employees don't actually even understand

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
their benefits despite the overwhelming

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
majority stating that benefits are very

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,640
important to them in their employment

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,040
decisions. Uh we al we also see limited

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
continuity. Some of those episodic and

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,200
transactional relationships with

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,400
providers and the these can often feel

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,280
generic uh irrelevant and inconsistent

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,920
with results being often delayed um no

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
regular check-ins along the way and a

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
lot of friction throughout the process.

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
This can often lead to frustration. So

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,720
from this perspective, it's really no

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,400
wonder that engagement is is low and and

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,879
users and members are reluctant to

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,360
engage. On the flip side, if we looked

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,840
at modern consumer engagement platforms,

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,879
uh think mobile apps, games, um you

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,360
know, social media, this often has high

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,519
frequency sustained engagement, 11,000

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,000
minutes a year. And for those of us who

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,160
didn't go to MIT, that's 180 hours um

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
every single year that they're engaging.

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,080
And this approach is really informed by

75
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,599
consumer science. It flips the script on

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
these traditional models. Um

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,800
interactions are personalized, they're

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
timely, they're relevant, they're

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,720
persistent, and really engaging. Um

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
rather than frustrating, they actually

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
generate excitement and are actively

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,920
enjoyable. Um for people who very few

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
people get giddy about going to a

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
doctor's appointment, but they might

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,000
light up when they achieve a milestone

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,720
on their app or are rewarded for it. So

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,440
the tools are there and really that's

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,360
why we believe in a trusted always on

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
personalized whole health partner

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
something that will meet members where

91
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,080
they are in their health journey and

92
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,040
focuses on personalization at scale

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,319
accessible guidance for the individual

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,159
um while continuing to offer the

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,480
credibility of clinical rigor and the

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,360
convenience of a mobile app. Um

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,480
important in this is choice architecture

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,560
which should be designed to be

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,319
convenient, attractive and normative

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,319
where engagement is a positive and

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,280
considered the social standard much like

102
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,640
what Joe was mentioning a moment ago and

103
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,760
throughout this process it's important

104
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,560
to make members feel cared for and

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,159
valued at the individual level. That

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,200
individual personalized experience is

107
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,879
very important. So that's easier said

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
than done. How do we actually go about

109
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,560
doing this? Um and at the core of our

110
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,160
platform is behavioral economics

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,639
principles. Consumer science is really

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,479
in our DNA from day one. Uh we start

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,440
with the data. What do we know about a

114
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,320
me a member uh from their data feeds,

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
claims, pharmacy data, wearables, and

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
then what can we learn about them as

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
they engage from their various patterns,

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
what archetypes they might fall into,

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,840
and then the self-reported information

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,720
that they share with us along the way.

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,720
At each step of our users journeys, uh

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
we aim to increase personalization. We

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,199
want to learn more about the members and

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,759
then play back those learnings to them

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,840
uh from their health needs and goals to

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
identifying opportunities and barriers

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,080
that they might face to achieving their

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,199
best health. And this ultimately enables

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,280
us to achieve this N of one with a

130
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,880
bespoke experience that's relevant,

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,080
timely, and enjoyable for each

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,320
individual on the platform.

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,880
From there, our platform connects with

134
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,039
members in ways that resonate with their

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
preferences. So with each touch point

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,880
we're learning about the individual

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,400
member. We're building a profile and

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,120
then we're able to dynamically improve

139
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,360
their experience accordingly. Uh we have

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
a content of library that's thousands of

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,600
actions spanning over a hundred

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,160
different clinical pathways to find the

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,240
most relevant interventions which

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,759
importantly um the member has a high

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
propensity to engage with. It's not good

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
enough to serve content that they are

147
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,320
not interested in participating with. Um

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
and a lot of that is thanks to our uh

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
clinical team that's building all this

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
um from the ground up. Um I think

151
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
several of which are on this call. So

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,960
thanks to shout out to them and thank

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,720
you. Um and without with all this on the

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,639
engagement journey, we really are

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,479
looking to overcome inertia. Um

156
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
identifying and addressing the barriers

157
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,880
acting on negative signals as well as

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,639
positive ones. And that's a key part of

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,360
successful engagement flywheel is

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,000
understanding what made a member engage

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,000
but then also what makes a member not

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,039
engage to find those barriers and help

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,039
address them. Um we also complement our

164
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,440
digital experience with a human touch

165
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,759
with our well guides. So this helps add

166
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
that personal touch where members can be

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
free to chat, learn, they can ask

168
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
questions and share insights that

169
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,080
potentially programmatic flows alone

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
wouldn't necessarily cover. Um, all of

171
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,639
this is spurred with a responsive

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,840
incentive system that offers relevant,

173
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,440
dynamic, meaningful rewards for members.

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
And this will come as no surprise to

175
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,120
you, but this classic Q action reward

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,199
feedback loop really does move the

177
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,600
needle and perpetuates engagement and

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,880
this flywheel effect. Um, every action

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,080
is tied to an incentive. Every incentive

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,080
offers a timely reward and each member

181
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,680
finds that rewards that resonate with

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,759
them. Um, those rewards are purposefully

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,639
architected to be attainable,

184
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,639
motivating, and engaging. Um, they can

185
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,360
be tangible. Think premium reductions

186
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,599
for long-term motivation or gift cards

187
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
for immediate gratification. Um,

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,479
sometimes even things like sweep stakes,

189
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,720
auctions, challenges, which gify the

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,800
experience. Um, these also have the

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
added benefit of breaking down the risk

192
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,039
of trying new behav behaviors and

193
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,440
habits. If you think about exercise,

194
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,840
diet, visiting a provider, those pose

195
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
potential risks for for users and

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,400
creating an incentive helps to overcome

197
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,720
that inertial hump. Um, other users

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,280
might find more motivation from

199
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,759
intangible rewards. Think streaks and

200
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
leaderboards and badges. And we've seen

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,880
really strong reactions on our platform

202
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,400
to social cues and team challenges where

203
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,400
people feel like they're doing something

204
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,440
that's normative. That's just the social

205
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,520
standard and the default. Um ultimately

206
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,759
rewarded engagement

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,759
drives habit formation which supports

208
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,080
health improvement and cost savings over

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,960
the long run.

210
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,840
Um we've seen the results of this kind

211
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,840
of structure and uh engagement is

212
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,599
important because it reflects success of

213
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
other metrics as well. Think of it in

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,039
some ways as a proxy, a temperature

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,520
check. Uh people engage when they're

216
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,080
satisfied. We've achieved an 85 plus

217
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,000
NPS, 4.9 out of five stars in the app

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,000
store. Members are um completing an

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,039
almost an action a day on average with

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,039
25% being active every single day. And

221
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,159
in turn, this has increased utilization

222
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:36,000
of benefits um with our uh employer uh

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,680
partners um leading to over a 6%

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,519
decrease in costs compared to control

225
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,719
groups. And that's before we even

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,880
account for things like reduced

227
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,040
absenteeism, productivity gains, and

228
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,120
turnover reductions.

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,959
So with this kind of success, we want to

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
keep the momentum going and we have to

231
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,640
ask ourselves, how do we keep

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
innovating? What's the next step? And

233
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
that's where MIT and the Sloan

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,480
partnership comes in. Um MIT is

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
collaborating with us on several

236
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720
research topics related to our our model

237
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,959
and our platform. Um, and the focus of

238
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,279
this is really the trifecta of driving

239
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,440
engagement, improving member health, and

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,440
reducing costs. Uh, we're using our

241
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,120
highfrequency engagement to develop

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
these predictive models that create

243
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
health achievement scores,

244
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,519
hospitalization predictions, and cost

245
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
savings estimates. Uh, imagine being

246
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,680
able to normalize health engagement at

247
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,760
the individual level, contextualize this

248
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,000
achievement score alongside peers within

249
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,040
an employer and benchmark across an

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,399
industry in this standardized way. That

251
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,000
goes back to the earlier point about

252
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,279
social cues and team challenges that

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
really motivates engagement at the

254
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,279
individual level. And importantly, these

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,200
aren't just purely academic exercises.

256
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,279
Um after our data exploration and build

257
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,959
phase where we are right now uh we'll be

258
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,040
deploying these algorithms in real world

259
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,839
tests uh with the intention of measuring

260
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,680
impact and um on engagement and health

261
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
improvement and we'll ultimately be

262
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,120
publishing these findings um from these

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
projects.

264
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
Throughout this process the MIT team has

265
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,920
been really great partners and we're

266
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,519
excited to deepen our partnership

267
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,920
through projects like this in the

268
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,920
future. Um, our hope is that through our

269
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,560
collaboration, we can advance our

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,920
mission of being the world's most

271
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,839
effective partner in advancing our

272
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,040
members health. And, uh, with that, um,

273
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,399
if you're interested, please feel free

274
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,320
to reach out to us at getwell.co.

275
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,920
Um, thanks and happy to answer any

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,240
questions.

277
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,959
>> Great. Thank Thank you. That's a lot of

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,200
information in a short time, so uh, for

279
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,440
folks who just want to know more, they

280
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,279
should definitely get in touch with you.

281
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,040
Um and I do have one question here about

282
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,120
um personalizing is key but the question

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
asker is concerned how does that how to

284
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,399
do that according to the European data

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
protection standards. Um person says I

286
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
would never do this only from the chance

287
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,720
of being hacked. So h how do you how do

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
you respond to that? Well, um there's

289
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,519
certainly a robust team of of

290
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,360
clinicians, data security officers, uh

291
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,800
data scientists, all all working to

292
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,279
ensure that we're compliant with all the

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,079
equivalent like SOCK 2, HIPPA, ISO

294
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,519
27,0001 uh requirements. And there's

295
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,480
certainly plenty of regulation, which

296
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,519
makes a lot of the innovation

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,839
challenging because you want to be

298
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,760
compliant and protect your your members.

299
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,480
But at the same time, one piece that we

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,360
really uh focused on is we don't just

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,519
ingest claims and then start um

302
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
surfacing content to individuals because

303
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,480
we want to avoid the creepy factor. We

304
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
want them to feel very comfortable and

305
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,200
trusted um as our as our health

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,959
navigation and wellness partner. Um and

307
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,040
so what we'll often do is wait until a

308
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,640
member has actually reported information

309
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
themselves, what they feel comfortable

310
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
sharing with us, and then it's just

311
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
incumbent upon us to be compliant with

312
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,800
data security provisions. And um we're

313
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,120
primarily based in the US right now, but

314
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,959
we do have a global presence. And so

315
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
making sure that we can maintain those

316
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,720
data security frameworks, but then

317
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
really um play back to the member things

318
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,680
that they've already shared with us that

319
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
also helps validate what we've seen with

320
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,920
other data feeds, claims, wearables, um

321
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,519
pharmacy, etc. Um and what's really

322
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
impressive about that, something that

323
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
was surprising to me was how much

324
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,079
members are willing to share once you

325
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
gain their trust, once they feel like

326
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,639
you're really on their team. Uh we've

327
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
had people chat about everything from,

328
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,560
you know, mental health issues,

329
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
alcoholism. Um we had people sharing

330
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
with us that they were pregnant and they

331
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,240
didn't know who to turn to in in various

332
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,880
situations about how to provide, you

333
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
know, formula and food for their family.

334
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,240
And so it often goes beyond just

335
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,279
immediate health uh concerns, but

336
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,959
actually starts talking about what is

337
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,720
the financial stressors, what are the

338
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,240
social situations that they're in, what

339
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,920
what are they stressing out about work,

340
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
and this is an employer sponsored

341
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,920
program for them. So we we really feel

342
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,000
like that trusted relationship is really

343
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,040
key and then of course compliance having

344
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,519
the team to back it up.

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,560
>> Great. Thank you. Um and one more

346
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,079
question is um and and I'm not sure if

347
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
you can answer this. Um are there

348
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,320
opportunities for personal measurement

349
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,440
of body capabilities such as integrating

350
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
with sensors?

351
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
>> Yeah, so we do have integrations with

352
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
things like Apple Health Kit and Google

353
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,399
Health. Um we also have various

354
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,920
wearables integrations. So, we're able

355
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,360
to collect some of those endpoints and

356
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,680
integrate into our platform. We have

357
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,279
these check-ins that you can either um

358
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,560
passively ingest with these wearable

359
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,240
integrations or you can actually

360
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,519
self-report. So, maybe you have your own

361
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,120
tools, you have things that you don't

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
want to link or can't link to our

363
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
platform. Um, but then you can actually

364
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
just self-report. Here's my blood

365
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,040
pressure, here's my, you know, resting

366
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,360
heart rate, here's my um exercise, diet,

367
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,519
sleep patterns. And so being able to

368
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,440
collect all those biometric uh data

369
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,360
points and then integrate them into our

370
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
algorithm which generally on average I

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,800
think for the members processes

372
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,480
something like 25,000 data points we

373
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,959
have about every member to really

374
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,200
surface the right content and the right

375
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,639
um interventions to to every individual

376
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,480
so that they have that personalized

377
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
relevant experience.

378
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
>> Right. Well thank you so much. I think

379
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
our time is up at this point. We have a

380
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,880
couple more speakers. So uh again for

381
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,639
the audience you know contact um Yuan or

382
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,160

383
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,199
