1
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,519
Okay, Tar has just joined us, I believe.

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,359
>> Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,640
>> Hey, TK.

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,079
Well, welcome. Uh and just as a a brief

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,320
introduction, um I'm really very proud

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,600
to introduce Tar Mansour to everyone. uh

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,440
he graduated from MIT

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,960
about six years ago or seven years ago

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,640
and he was actually in this class and so

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,680
uh we're really very pleased that he has

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,719
come as a guest lecturer and his

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,800
background he left when he left MIT he

13
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:04,000
joined really the giants of Wall Street

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,080
um Goldman Sachs, Citadel and

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,040
Bridgewwater. daughter. I'm sure most of

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,640
you are very familiar with those names.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:20,000
And three years ago, he uh started Khi

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,960
with uh Luana Lopez Laura uh another MIT

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,960
student uh and I think it's been a

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,159
phenomenal success especially in the

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,280
last month. So let me hand it over to

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:36,000
Tar to share his experiences and details

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
on Kelshi.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
>> Well yeah well first of all thanks for

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
having me Peter um you know really

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,240
really excited to be back in the class.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,360
I know the one I did last year um and I

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,799
think I did the year before that um and

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
uh maybe I'll talk a little about

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
background uh uh you know sort of

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
leading time. So, the way I'm thinking

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
about doing this is just I'll talk a

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,119
little about the story of Cali, how we

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
decide to do it, what is the long-term

35
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,399
vision, what we're trying to achieve.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,000
Um, and then we'll do a little bit of

37
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,119
Q&A. Um, uh, and then basically we see

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,759
how it goes from there.

39
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,080
>> Excuse me, T. Just a quick question. Um,

40
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,599
your your video isn't uh on for us. I

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
don't know if you can turn it on. That

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,000
would be great.

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
>> It should be on, but let me check. It's

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,640
on for me, so it's on on Zoom. So, let

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,120
me check. Let me double check. One sec.

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,680
Oh, that's great.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
We can see you now.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,400
>> Oh, great. Great. Sorry about that. I

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,239
think I'm in a little bit of a unstable

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,720
uh uh unstable Wi-Fi. Um so, yeah, I

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,720
mean I I um maybe I'll talk a little bit

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,519
about my my background. I I really like

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,319
going back to to to this class because a

54
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,040
lot of sort of the interest um in

55
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,000
financial markets and math um I think

56
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,080
stem from the class. So I I was born in

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,080
California. I grew up in Lebanon. I

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680
think one of the

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,400
things that I basically really enjoyed

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,599
doing in in in middle middle school and

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
high school is I I actually really love

62
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,840
math. I I really really like math and um

63
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,879
I think felt like MIT was the right

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
place to go. Um

65
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,519
if for someone who basically really

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
loves math and and so got into MIT and

67
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,640
the thing I realized is the best

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
application of math is is finance. Um so

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
started working in in a number of um

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
whether it was like sell side or buy

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,280
side. So so banks like Goldman Sachs, I

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,239
worked at Citadel, I worked at small

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
prop a few small prop shops. Um and then

74
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,720
the thing I realized is like I would say

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
like I realized two things. I mean one I

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,200
like trading. I really like enjoy

77
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,920
trading but I I I I realized I prefer

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
sort of building more. I I I like I like

79
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
the sort of notion of building new

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
products, building something new that is

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,120
sort of tangible

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,599
and two um when I was at Goldman I mean

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,319
I think a lot of the things um that

84
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
we've sort of seen is that like you know

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,120
financial instruments do get developed

86
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
over time they take a long period of

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
time but there is a lot of opportunities

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,799
to basically develop new things and

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
there's always needs for a lot of new

90
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
things. One example in 2016 is that a

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,200
lot of people were actually trying to

92
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,040
get a hedge or an exposure to Brexit um

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
and they didn't really there weren't

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,079
really like the right instruments for

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,079
that. People use traditional financial

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,919
instruments like stocks and options and

97
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
others to get that sort of binary

98
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,360
exposure that people were looking for. U

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
and um it was just not perfect. it was

100
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
not as it was was a proxy was indirect

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
and and it was super expensive um

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,280
because it was what we call over the

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,800
counter OTC traded um and so what we

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
thought you know and it was kind of

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
really early at the time like well what

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
if we have a financial market so we have

107
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
a financial market for equities so that

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,840
prices equities one that prices credit

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
like bonds and so on one that prices

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
commodities and we have financial

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
markets for currencies what if we had a

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,199
financial market that prices basically

113
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
any question about the future any event

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,880
that is in the horizon that that is

115
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,479
meaningful economically or socially or

116
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,040
culturally. And I think the the thing

117
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,320
that became very apparent is

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,240
one if if such a market were to exist,

119
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,199
it could it has the potential to be the

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,639
biggest financial market of all. Um

121
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
mostly because it's just broader than

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,240
anything else that came before it. And

123
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,919
two, um there were a lot of regulatory

124
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,680
issues with that with that type of

125
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,919
market. Basically, historically, US has

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,120
made these uh illegal or unregulated.

127
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,639
They haven't let anyone do it. And you

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
know, at the time, we were very naive.

129
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
Um we

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
we thought, well, that sounds like a

131
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,919
problem we could solve. Um and

132
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,440
uh we just got into it. So, we decided

133
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,960
to start a company. Uh I didn't go back

134
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,120
to Citadel and and uh um and so we just

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
decided to start Koshi. And the premise

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,080
is really like it's like you know how

137
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
about what if we build sort of the first

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199
large scale operation market and we want

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,440
to do it as a financial exchange a

140
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
regulated financial exchange. Um so that

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,880
this can become an asset class that's

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,039
traded one day by the large hedge funds

143
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,360
and institutions and and brokers and so

144
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,039
on and so forth. Um and you know when we

145
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,759
first started it was it was tough. So I

146
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,759
think that the the the the the

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
well well any company is really tough to

148
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
start but I think this was particularly

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
tough because like we it was kind of

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
funny story was like we called pretty

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,280
much every single securities derivatives

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,280
lawyer in the country and asked them

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,160
like hey we're trying to do this like

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,680
what what you know can you help us um

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
and the answer was basically like

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
everybody sort of like the range was

157
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
like either being laughed out of the

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
room all the way to sort of like hey

159
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,479
this is this is just not going to work

160
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,160
like the the CFTC and the regulators

161
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,280
just like never wanted to do anything

162
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,639
like this. And

163
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,319
the reason we kind of kept going is

164
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
because none of the answers are actually

165
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
intellectually satisfying. Like there

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
wasn't a kind of a clear answer like

167
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
okay why they're like well because of

168
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,039
you know there's they could be

169
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
manipulated like okay but like that's

170
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,240
solvable same it was solve with the

171
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
stock market. Um and then the other one

172
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
is like well it could be gambling. I was

173
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
like, well, why is it gambling and you

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
know something like uh you know a grain

175
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
futures not I mean you know some people

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,400
are specking on on grain futures and

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
sure some people are hedging on great

178
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
future but it's the same thing for

179
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
Brexit like a lot of people are exposed

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,120
to Brexit and

181
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
um we kept going we basically got the

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
company uh regulated uh we took three

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
years so we took two years and a half to

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,919
three to basically get it reg regulated

185
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,440
and we basically launched the first

186
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
legal exchange or legal prediction

187
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
market in the US after that um it took

188
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,280
us a very long time was it was very long

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,800
journey. Uh but we got the exchange, we

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,599
got the clearing house. Uh well, we got

191
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,639
the exchange at the time and we got up

192
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
and running. Um and you know um I think

193
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,120
Peter has seen the sort of journey of

194
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,360
the company. Um we um we we started

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,360
running and then we we we grew a lot and

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,080
then we had a bunch of sort of like I

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,479
would say like issues and and and

198
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,639
um and and infighting between us and the

199
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,680
federal government, the CFTC uh

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
especially this kind of prior

201
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
administration which was kind of really

202
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,039
tough on financial financial services

203
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
and financial innovation. Um and the big

204
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,479
thing that happened is they didn't let

205
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
us list the election market uh which we

206
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,080
always believe is kind of one of the

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,759
biggest markets uh of all basically we

208
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,879
uh it was a you know we took a very long

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,360
time to make that decision. It was very

210
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,720
tough one uh but we ended up suing the

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
federal government. So we were really

212
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,879
one of those sort of first you know uh I

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,319
would say examples of a of a of a

214
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,680
regulated company suing its own

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,520
regulator. Um is very tough and painful

216
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,120
decision to make at the time. Obviously

217
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,240
it was the right one now. uh looking at

218
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,560
looking back in retrospect um and we won

219
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,000
earlier this fall and and so that win

220
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,519
was actually the first time in a hundred

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
years that you can actually trade

222
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,279
legally on the election in the US and

223
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,279
that opens up a lot of opportunities

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,440
beyond the election. Uh because what the

225
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
lawsuit was about is like you know it's

226
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
really expanding the universe of of

227
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,480
things that are considered financial

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,800
instruments now. Um, and so where Kashi

229
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
is at now, um, you know, we've grown a

230
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
lot over the last few years, but

231
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,000
definitely the last month. Um, we have,

232
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
um, um, we've done over a billion of

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,279
volume in the last in the last month

234
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,640
alone. And, um, uh, you know, now kind

235
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,040
of as we think about our future

236
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,200
expansion plans, um, we're getting into

237
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
a number of different categories. Um,

238
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
you know, financial services, like just

239
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
just basically like financial markets,

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
sports. We want to basically have a

241
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,320
market for every single piece of news

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
that's out there in the world. And uh we

243
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,880
want to over time what we're doing is

244
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,600
like we're integrating some of the large

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,080
brokerages where we're going to have um

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,519
um you know people can come to cash.com

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,959
to trade the asset but also if you want

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,880
to trade the asset from your own

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
brokerage account like 041k in your

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
stocks you'll be able to do that on

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,680
Schwab, Robin Hood, Fidelity and so on.

252
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,760
um we'll talk a little bit about sort of

253
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,880
um you know kind of finishing the

254
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
narrative of arc and then I'll talk some

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,320
of sort of personal stuff going from

256
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,399
being a student to starting a company

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,080
and so on but one of the things that um

258
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,760
you know was interesting throughout the

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,480
journey is uh a lot of what it basically

260
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,399
ends up taking is is just perseverance

261
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,839
um uh around um uh basically

262
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,600
perseverance towards the goal that

263
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,519
you're trying to achieve. Um, we, you

264
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
know, you know, I mentioned in the

265
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,640
beginning that we were naive when we

266
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,640
first started and in retrospect, I think

267
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
that was actually one of the best things

268
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,120
that or I'd say one of the best tools

269
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,040
that we had actually being naive. Uh,

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,959
because a lot of the people that like if

271
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,120
if we knew how hard it would be, we

272
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,399
probably just wouldn't have done it. Um,

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,519
and there's something to be said about,

274
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,839
you know, when you climb a mountain,

275
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,760
people tell you um just look at the next

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
step, one step at a time. uh don't look

277
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,720
at the at the summit just because you

278
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
know when you look at summit you get

279
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,399
tired. Um and I think there's a lot to

280
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,240
be said. I think this applies to pretty

281
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,680
much anything meaningful in life. I

282
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
think just doing anything meaningful

283
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,399
basically requires a lot of

284
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,120
perseverance. Um the company has raised

285
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:02,560
um u more than $100 million from a few

286
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:05,200
investors. Sequoia um KKR Schwab itself

287
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,040
uh YC and a bunch of others in Silicon

288
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Valley. Um, and um, I think that's about

289
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,399
it. I think I covered most things. Um,

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,680
Peter, I was thinking we could do a

291
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,360
little bit of Q&A and then we can sort

292
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,480
of orient the conversation some of the

293
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
places that the students want to hear

294
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,279
about.

295
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,160
>> Yes. Great. Thank you, T. And let's see,

296
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,120
with questions just uh, so Tar can hear

297
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,120
you, we'll hand you a microphone or

298
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,399
we'll pass a microphone to you.

299
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
>> One, two.

300
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,959
>> Okay. I don't know where you can see me

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,240
from. Um this so yeah this is um like

302
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,399
really fascinating. I I I um I'm just I

303
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,720
have a question which is like what what

304
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,279
is the difference between like this and

305
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
like a betting market? Like um to me it

306
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,480
sounds like the same like you're you're

307
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,040
betting on an event. Um because surely

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,720
like if someone wanted to hedge against

309
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,200
Brexit, they could just go onto a bet

310
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
betting market and bet you know a

311
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,120
certain quantity of money on on whether

312
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,120
Brexit happens.

313
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
Um, a few things. So, there's a lot of

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,880
similarities. I mean, and I would say

315
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,160
there's a lot of similarities between

316
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
betting markets and just any traditional

317
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,399
financial market. There's a lot of

318
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,480
people that like are speculating or

319
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
betting or gambling on a lot really a

320
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,399
lot of markets including crypto and

321
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,079
stocks and really anything. But I think

322
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,760
like it's it's a bit more of a

323
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,519
structural difference. Like first of

324
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
all, this is an exchange. People are

325
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,240
trading against each other. We're not

326
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,920
there's no book there's no bookie.

327
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
There's no concept of bookie. And

328
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,480
actually any institution that wants to

329
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,399
hedge against Brexit would never do it

330
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,880
in a vetting market. Um just because you

331
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,399
know the prices are set by the bookie.

332
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
Uh they would do it probably with an

333
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,600
investment bank which is what they're

334
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,880
doing right now. Uh but the prices are

335
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
kind of bad at the investment bank. It's

336
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,760
like over the counter you know you

337
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,360
negotiate bilaterally with the

338
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
investment bank instead of just

339
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
basically doing it on on exchange where

340
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,440
like there's other people that are

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,720
independently pricing the events uh uh

342
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
so that you can basically know what the

343
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,800
right price is to basically make the

344
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,000
transaction at. Um I I I think like

345
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,839
there are a lot of similarities and

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,279
frankly like I I I haven't you know we

347
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,800
we don't really discern them quite quite

348
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,000
much. I I think like over time the two

349
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,240
are converging and they're going to be

350
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,760
end up being one and the same. Uh the

351
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,240
fundamental difference I would say like

352
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
from a regulatory or legal perspective

353
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
but also like sort of like why is it the

354
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,519
financial instrument is like are you

355
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,440
trading on natural risks or are you

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
trading on artificial risks? Right?

357
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
Right. So, like when you go to casino

358
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,600
and you roll a dice, um that's like a

359
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,639
risk that you're creating for the

360
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,800
purpose of entertainment. Whereas, you

361
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
know, um Brexit, that's that's not a

362
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
risk that you're creating for the

363
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,519
purpose of entertainment. That's a risk

364
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
that exists that some people have and

365
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,720
they're exposed to and they may want to

366
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,920
basically transfer it to someone else

367
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,360
and and so that's sort of the

368
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,399
delineation of why this is a financial

369
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,920
market and why um you know uh uh having

370
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,639
it on a on a financial market is

371
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,839
appropriate. Um but yeah, I mean I think

372
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
the two main difference like it is an

373
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,320
exchange like we have an order book

374
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,760
people are trading it the same way as a

375
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,279
stock market the same way they trade in

376
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,120
a stock market and then two um it's it's

377
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
it's risk that exists and so people can

378
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
basically do what they want with that

379
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,800
risk whether they want to get exposed to

380
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,399
it more by speculating or they want to

381
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
expose get exposed to it less by

382
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
hedging.

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,639
>> It's a great question.

384
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,800
>> Thanks. Can I just ask a quick followup

385
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
which is like is and this has just come

386
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
to my mind so it may be a silly question

387
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,680
but is there any like has there been any

388
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,519
like arbitrage opportunities between

389
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,920
like the betting markets and and this

390
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,760
exchange?

391
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,120
>> Yeah. I mean well well we're the only

392
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,880
legal one in the US. So there there's

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,959
kind of I mean in terms of there more

394
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,639
there's more arbitrage

395
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,680
between us and traditional financial

396
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,040
assets. So with the election for

397
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,519
example, people were arbitrage like a

398
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,800
lot of hedge funds were arbitrageing um

399
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:33,040
the election market with um uh other

400
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,160
assets like crypto or or like S&P and so

401
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,600
on and that we see we see a lot of that.

402
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,399
>> Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. That's

403
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,399
fascinating. Thank you.

404
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
I think Stephen, I don't know if you can

405
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,360
give him uh I don't know if you can

406
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,360
unmute yourself or

407
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,000
>> question.

408
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,519
>> Can you hear me?

409
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,800
>> Yep. Yep.

410
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,800
>> Yeah. Um I'm also like interested in

411
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
careers in in trading as well and I find

412
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,440
it fascinating as well. So it's good to

413
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,519
hear that you were um interested in that

414
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,519
um and did that as a career. I was just

415
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,959
wondering how did your experiences

416
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,320
working um in trading kind of help you

417
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,480
to um or if if those skills helped you

418
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,480
with um like what you pursued at Pulse

419
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,480
or

420
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,040
>> um I I would say like um

421
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
maybe like a few things. So, so, so one,

422
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,560
I mean, it's always good to get

423
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,959
firsthand exposure into how things are

424
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,880
done in a market that you're you're like

425
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,399
trying to be trying to to to disrupt.

426
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,760
It's like good like you have to have a

427
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,360
reasonably good understanding of how

428
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
things work. And the thing I'd say is

429
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,320
like it's interesting like if you stay

430
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,320
in an industry for too long, it actually

431
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,040
gets a bit harder to disrupt it. you get

432
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,959
too conditioned for to how things are

433
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,399
done and and uh you you maybe you get

434
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,639
maybe you it gets harder for you to

435
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,639
become to to have any degree of of

436
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
diabete which I so I think it's not a

437
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,399
very good thing but I think some degree

438
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,920
of experience is good so that you have b

439
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,680
like based on understanding of what your

440
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,279
end customer how your end customer

441
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
basically thinks about the world and how

442
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,440
they use different products and adopt

443
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,959
them. Um, the second thing I think is

444
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
I would say I learned a lot from the

445
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,680
from the Citadel culture. Maybe less

446
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
from Goldman and some of the others, but

447
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,360
Citadel

448
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,079
u I really enjoyed working at Citadel.

449
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,199
Um, I I really like a lot of the aspects

450
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,079
of the culture and the way that things

451
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,680
are done. And I would say like it it was

452
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,399
interesting because I think had sort of

453
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,160
this like ultimate version of um

454
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
um

455
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
let's call it like sort of like

456
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,880
performance-driven culture but but but

457
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,639
and what I mean by that is like it's a

458
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,959
full meritocracy is very little sort of

459
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
like management layers even if you're

460
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,800
young they will give you a lot of

461
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,680
ability to sort of take risks and and do

462
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,519
big things. Um, and they're uniquely fit

463
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,800
to do that because in trading that

464
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,360
something that's very unique to trading

465
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,959
is that you you have a P&L. It's

466
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
undeniable whether you're doing well

467
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
versus not. Uh, you know, if you make

468
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,720
money, you're doing well. If you're not,

469
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
you're not. Uh, whereas in a lot of like

470
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
in tech and others like there's a lot of

471
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,959
politics like you know, the boss likes

472
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,600
you versus not. I mean, there's just

473
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,120
like a lot lot of noise and and I think

474
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,559
we try to kind of bring that to to to

475
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,400
the culture of the company as much as we

476
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
can. We're very flat as a company. like

477
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
we have a lot of people, you know,

478
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,160
they're a few years out of college, a

479
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
lot of them are from MIT, you know,

480
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,840
they're they're running huge huge chunks

481
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,320
of the company already and with teams

482
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,520
and so on. Um, and and and just because

483
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,720
like, you know, for us it's very similar

484
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,240
like if you do well, you basically grow

485
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,600
extremely fast within a few months of

486
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,120
the company and if not then um and and

487
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
so and that comes a bit from the trading

488
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,760
culture, I would say.

489
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,760
>> Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you.

490
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,960
Uh I can feel in a question. Uh hey,

491
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
good to see you back in the class.

492
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
>> Um

493
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,799
>> good seeing you.

494
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,039
>> Good to see you. So uh can you talk a

495
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,000
little bit about uh your margin

496
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,400
requirement and also maybe uh central

497
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,400
clearing I guess uh you know you have

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
two parties right taking the opposite

499
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,480
side of a contract. I mean the payout

500
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,679
let's say is 100%. They they may have

501
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,919
paid you know a percentage of that total

502
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,919
payout. When the market moves do you

503
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,880
require them to post a variation margin

504
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,919
or how do you how do you monitor that?

505
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,280
>> Yeah. So we we are fully cash collarized

506
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
right now. So what it means like people

507
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
put the money up front for their

508
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,559
positions

509
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,160
um and then we basically mark to market

510
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,000
every day. Actually mark to market on a

511
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,559
real-time basis. So we we we do it real

512
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
time. Um

513
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
we are going to introduce leverage next

514
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
year I think and that's going to be

515
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,799
pretty interesting. We're thinking about

516
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,720
you know kind of our margin model is

517
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,480
going to be um and maybe for the class

518
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,000
to explain. So so in a lot of financial

519
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,679
markets

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,600
you what what people consider kind of

521
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,440
margin or leverage is like when you buy

522
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,480
when hedge funds basically buy let's say

523
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,000
you know um an interest rate future or

524
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,520
like S&P future uh let's say they want

525
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
to buy like a million dollar worth of

526
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
S&P future. They don't put up a million

527
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
dollars with the clearing house and the

528
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,280
exchange. They put up, let's say,

529
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,240
$100,000 or $10,000, which would be 10%

530
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,640
1% margin. And then as the thing moves

531
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,840
over time, you know, the clearing house

532
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,799
asks you to, you know, if you if you

533
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,640
made a little bit of money, the clearing

534
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
house pays you. And if you lost, the

535
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,880
clearing house asks you to put up a bit

536
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,760
more margin to cover your losses. And it

537
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,360
goes like that over time. Uh, Gaus is a

538
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,520
simpler model where like we actually ask

539
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,600
for 100% upfront. We tell everyone like,

540
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,760
"Hey, give us all the money up front so

541
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,360
that there's no risk in the system." And

542
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,799
you're always sure that anything you

543
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,160
lose is like what you lose up front,

544
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,320
like what you put up front. You cannot

545
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
lose more than that. Um, over time,

546
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,360
we're going to start introducing

547
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
leverage, which is like we don't take

548
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,320
100% up front. Um, and that's what Jake

549
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,679
was asking about. And I think it's a

550
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,039
complicated that's a complicated thing

551
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
because regulators are becoming very

552
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
strict about how we do this and we have

553
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
to be very we need to make sure that

554
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,240
nothing like 20 2008 can happen again.

555
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,600
Um and so there's a lot of like

556
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,200
requirements around how this needs to be

557
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,520
done. Um and

558
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,360
uh um you know so we expect to basically

559
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,720
increase maybe margin like end of next

560
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,039
year potentially um uh and you know

561
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,799
we'll see how that goes. We do have some

562
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,240
products where for example if there's a

563
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,760
lot of strong correlation between two

564
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,159
products we return some collateral to

565
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,480
the participant um and we've already

566
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
started doing some of that. Um but you

567
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,679
know over time we'll do more and more.

568
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,679
Yes it's a great question.

569
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,320
Yeah. So I I have a question on like

570
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,679
kind of how the projections for the

571
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,520
company have changed since the election.

572
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,520
Like I assume there's a lot more volume

573
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,880
going through Koshi during that election

574
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
period. Have you guys been able to

575
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,880
retain a lot of that trading volume or

576
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,039
did you see a huge falloff and like how

577
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,919
did just the election general change

578
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,880
where you see the company going?

579
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
>> Yeah, I mean I think I think it's like

580
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,760
the election. So, it's obviously it's

581
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,440
super huge, but it's interesting because

582
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,679
our volume right now is actually higher

583
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,919
than it was um in the days leading up to

584
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,679
the election. So, and I think that's how

585
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,280
exchanges work like once you kind of

586
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,280
acquire a lot of like acquire and on

587
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,960
board and open accounts for customers,

588
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,159
they kind of retain they stick they do

589
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,559
other products. Now, we're seeing a lot

590
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,559
of uptake in crypto um we're seeing a

591
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,240
lot of optics in our economics product.

592
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,360
We're seeing uptake on a lot of the

593
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,960
politics like who's going to be in the

594
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,320
cabinet, who's gonna there's kind of all

595
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
these questions about like what what's

596
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,000
government going to look like in the

597
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
next year. Um and then you have a lot of

598
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,679
like you know crazy categories like

599
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,120
weather people like come and are very

600
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,559
active on sort of daily weather markets

601
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,240
and then entertainment markets and so

602
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,000
on. So we see a lot of opportunities

603
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,159
across all these categories. Um and uh

604
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,360
yeah I mean I don't think like so you

605
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,640
know it's not going to be the same

606
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
levels that what we've seen in the kind

607
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,559
of two days leading up to the election

608
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
but I think we're we're we're you know

609
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,919
at a much higher level than what we were

610
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,760
prior to the election. Now it was a huge

611
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,720
think of it as like a huge marketing

612
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,320
marketing moment for the company. Um and

613
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,720
sort of and that enabled sort of the

614
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,720
product to go mainstream.

615
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,799
It's

616
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,760
>> yeah good to see you. Yeah. Um

617
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,919
>> seeing you.

618
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,000
>> Yeah. Um a a question. So uh can you uh

619
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,559
reveal how what's the percentage between

620
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,080
institutional clients and and

621
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,440
individuals uh on culture at the moment

622
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,159
>> right now I say the breakdown of volume

623
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,720
is like 30 40% institutional uh and the

624
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,200
rest is retail um um and I expect it to

625
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,400
basically go towards 50/50

626
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,320
um over time um

627
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,320
it's interesting like institutions do a

628
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,120
lot more volume But you can charge them

629
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,640
less whereas retail like you know

630
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,039
individual customers they do less volume

631
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
but they can be charged much more and

632
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,039
you know historically you know people

633
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
have seen the business model of being

634
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,240
kind of institutional first like the

635
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,799
large exchanges like you know NASDAQ or

636
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,200
CME they're mostly institutional

637
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,240
um uh but I think it was kind of a

638
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,840
strategic mistake and I think they're

639
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,080
waking up to it. They're realizing like,

640
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,600
oh god, like people on Reddit and

641
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,280
Twitter and and average people now hold

642
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,120
a lot of the power, right? Like, you

643
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,559
know, they can decide that a company

644
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,559
like Nvidia is going to be worth, you

645
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,400
know, a few trillion dollars like and

646
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,080
and and that wasn't possible before.

647
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,919
Like people are richer now. People are

648
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
more involved in the financial market.

649
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,919
Um, and they're less price sensitive.

650
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,559
And so you see companies like Coinbase

651
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,159
are doing incredibly well. And yes, they

652
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,320
have much less like Coinbase volume on a

653
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,000
yearly basis is around like I think like

654
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,919
50 to 60 billion. Um, CME's volume is

655
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,559
like a quadrillion, right? Like it's

656
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,640
like not even comparable. Um, but

657
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,720
Coinbase charges a lot more, right? They

658
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,760
they charge you a lot more per per

659
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
dollar traded. Um, and and I think we

660
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,559
see that same balance and and I think

661
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,080
that the you know, it's interesting like

662
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,480
the thing that we see

663
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,240
and I see this trend sort of continuing

664
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,919
in the next few years, especially with

665
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,520
the Trump administration. um like

666
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:21,679
there's a very strong appetite for new

667
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,279
like new financial markets and new media

668
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,120
like there's a lot of distrust in the

669
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,880
system both in the sort of Wall Street

670
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,320
and financial markets but also media

671
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,799
people just don't don't really believe

672
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,000
the kind of pundits and traditional

673
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,200
social authorities and and I think like

674
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,039
prediction markets are very uniquely

675
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,200
suited to be at the intersection of both

676
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,080
and that's a fun like that's a like

677
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,760
that's a retail first market. It's like

678
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,600
a retail first and then the institutions

679
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,520
follow rather than institution first and

680
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,080
then figure out how to get the retail to

681
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,120
adopt essentially. Um and and we're

682
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,640
seeing that. We're seeing that.

683
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,960
>> Right. Very interesting. Thank you,

684
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,480
>> Stephen.

685
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,640
Yeah. I had a question about because you

686
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,080
said that you were trying to also get

687
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,120
into sports as well, right? Uh, so I was

688
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,480
wondering if you like plan on offering

689
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,400
like or similar things to like other

690
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,799
sports books and stuff like traditional

691
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,080
bets like money lines and and stuff like

692
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,360
that or would it be more of like the

693
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,159
more more like a broader prediction type

694
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,120
sports bets?

695
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:32,159
>> We um

696
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,640
um that's a good question. Uh both

697
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,000
basically is the way I put it. Uh I I

698
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,760
you know I think uh both um you know the

699
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,880
the the prediction stuff is the one

700
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,880
that's more interesting because that's

701
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,799
the one that like people and news thinks

702
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,000
about like what are some of the kind of

703
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,799
big things that are going to happen in

704
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,720
the next few few few months or years and

705
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,400
then the money line is just like very

706
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,400
retentive like people come back and they

707
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,240
do it over and over and then they engage

708
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,559
with the product meaningfully in a very

709
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,919
consistent way. So I think that yeah I

710
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,120
think that the answer is both. We have

711
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
some regulatory work to do on that

712
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,480
front, but the the next administration

713
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
is gonna be very favorable. I mean,

714
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
Trump himself has been coding our

715
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,960
markets a lot. He loves the market. He

716
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,679
loves the company. He's I think it's

717
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,360
gonna see a big shift from, you know, um

718
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,799
an administration that was somewhat

719
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,960
anti- financial innovation to admission

720
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,159
is going to be very very pro financial

721
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,400
innovation and prediction market

722
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,039
specifically.

723
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,559
>> Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

724
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,279
>> So, Tar, I feeling another question. Uh

725
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,520
I don't know if you can talk about the

726
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,640
revenue of the company. Is the company

727
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,360
profitable so far or the revenue model

728
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,200
is from a commission model just to kind

729
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,760
of give students some idea how uh why

730
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,640
you know the investors are interested in

731
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,720
owning the company.

732
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,640
>> Um the company can be profitable if you

733
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,320
want to but uh we don't right now. Um

734
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,679
and you know it's you know often times

735
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,279
it's a little bit of a counterintuitive

736
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,600
thing but I think you know increasing

737
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,120
the like

738
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,919
growth at this stage is more important

739
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,559
than profitability in a lot of cases. Um

740
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,760
and because and the reason why exchanges

741
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,679
like exchanges are very popular

742
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,039
businesses. They're very hard to set up.

743
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,159
It's unbelievably hard to get an

744
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,840
exchange up and running. It's just

745
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,279
really really difficult. But when it's

746
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,640
up and running and you have liquidity

747
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,159
it's actually one of the best form of

748
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,760
businesses. It's some of the most

749
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,400
profitable businesses are exchanges

750
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,840
actually. Um uh and so right now the

751
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,720
strategy is basically like hardcore

752
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,440
expansion just grow grow go mainstream

753
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,720
get people used to the asset. um we're

754
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,159
making revenue but it's just like we're

755
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,760
reinvesting it all into marketing and

756
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,279
growth and then over time we're

757
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,520
basically like you know as we deserve

758
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,960
taper taper and as we get to even larger

759
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,120
scale basically like you know turn on

760
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,039
the the profit machine and the source of

761
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,559
revenue it's interesting like we make

762
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,240
money on um uh on tra trading fees like

763
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,520
like CME or New York Stock Exchange you

764
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,279
take you take a fee of every transaction

765
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,240
like if you put $100 on cash we take one

766
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,360
to $2 and then uh on market making so we

767
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,039
have a separate arm it's a bit like

768
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,640
Citadel market making on this product

769
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,600
and they're already kind the one of the

770
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
prime market makers. They have

771
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,159
competition so they compete a lot

772
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,559
against SIG which was one of our major

773
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,039
partners and then there's a few other uh

774
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,520
prop shops or like market making like

775
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,200
like a hedge fund in the in the the firm

776
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,799
and then three over time right now we

777
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
make it all free and open source but the

778
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,480
data is very valuable. We have a lot of

779
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,039
very valuable data about like trends and

780
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,720
where where the word is going um and and

781
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,159
and and there's a lot of demand to kind

782
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,760
of like get the data but for now we're

783
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,039
just like making it open source. Anyone

784
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,399
can use it. Anyone can make use of it

785
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,440
over time. We can basically capture

786
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,440
value at that as well.

787
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,919
Just a follow up on that. Uh you know

788
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,880
you mentioned Citadel SIG those market

789
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:46,480
makers. Uh how do you incentivize them

790
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,520
to uh you know come to uh Koshi and uh

791
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,080
are there any requirements of how tight

792
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,399
the bid offer the spread they need to

793
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,559
make um when they make market on certain

794
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,000
contracts?

795
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,120
>> Yeah. So no there definitely

796
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
requirements. So, so you know, I'll give

797
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,720
you an example. In the election market,

798
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,200
there had to be one cent spread with a

799
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,399
million dollar on each side, uh, at

800
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,799
least. Um, and it was funny because Jeff

801
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,120
Yas, the founder of SIG, actually texted

802
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,559
Elon and asked him if he wanted to do a

803
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,559
$100 million trade on Koshi uh during

804
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,039
the the election, but then Elon was too

805
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,799
concerned of conflict of interest and

806
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,840
uh, and a bunch of things, but and they

807
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,520
could have done it with one cent. So,

808
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,559
the spreads were very very tight. I'm

809
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,320
saying this because like they could have

810
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,640
done they could do up to $100 million

811
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,799
within like one cent slippage uh which

812
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,320
was which is really awesome and so yes

813
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,000
there are requirements around spread and

814
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,000
and and

815
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,679
u and and depth. I think the way we

816
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,120
think about like the ecosystem needs to

817
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:47,760
be or the way that it's structured

818
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,279
um um um uh you know you give some

819
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,640
incentives at the beginning of market so

820
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,159
that after that you basically let let it

821
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
do and their incentives basically they

822
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,559
they're getting flow they're trading

823
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,159
against a bunch of other people and then

824
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,159
they hope to make money market making

825
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,720
and doing like getting better ass spread

826
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,159
essentially and so that's a sort of like

827
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,240
it I would say like the structure and

828
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,159
it's pretty common structure in in in in

829
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,159
the traditional markets I think your

830
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,760
question is good Because the stock

831
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,000
exchanges, they do a lot of incentive

832
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,120
because stocks, there's a lot of stock

833
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,159
markets. There's like a lot of stock

834
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,840
exchanges. They're very competitive with

835
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,679
each other because of the way that the

836
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,799
SEC has set up rules. In the CMC world,

837
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
there's not a lot of competition. It's

838
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,960
actually very monopolistic in nature.

839
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,440
Like each one has their like CME has

840
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
interest rate swaps and and S&P. ICE has

841
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,399
all the energy stuff. And I think we may

842
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,679
be able I think looks like we're going

843
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,240
to be able to dominate anything that's

844
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:36,080
event related over time. Uh, so um I'm

845
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,480
just intrigued as to how you've gone

846
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,480
from like just like working in like um a

847
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,360
company like Citadel or Goldman to just

848
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,520
having this idea of this um exchange and

849
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,520
like actually just being able to make it

850
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,960
because to me it seems like even if I

851
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
had like an idea of like oh this would

852
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,600
be a great thing to turn in into an

853
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,240
exchange like just the idea of actually

854
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,320
making that happen seemed really um like

855
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,399
hard to achieve. So, like how from like

856
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,919
like from the idea to actually like

857
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,840
getting it into a reasonable um like uh

858
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,120
product, how did how did you like what

859
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,120
did you have to do? Did you just like

860
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,880
have to literally start emailing people

861
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,600
in the industry and then start like

862
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,279
working your way up? How did that work?

863
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,080
>> Yeah.

864
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,520
>> So, yes. Yes. That's it. I mean, that's

865
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,120
literally it. like I there's one of the

866
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,640
um

867
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,240
um

868
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,960
I I'll say a few things about this and

869
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,480
because I thought about this a lot. So,

870
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,080
um,

871
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
it was a tough decision to leave Citadel

872
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,679
like when I and I I don't I think Peter

873
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,399
you and I had a conversation about this

874
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,120
as well. Like I I think at the time like

875
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,200
we um

876
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,519
you know Citadel pays a lot of money,

877
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,039
you know, like like even as a first-time

878
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,559
it's like crazy and and so like you know

879
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,600
I didn't come from a very privileged

880
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,519
background. So like I remember I had a

881
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,880
conversation with my parents like like

882
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,080
hey I wanted to start this company like

883
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,440
oh what is it about? I was like oh this

884
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
thing called prediction. viously they

885
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,960
had no idea, you know, what what what I

886
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,840
was talking about and I was like, "Yeah,

887
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,360
yeah, I mean, there's another problem."

888
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,880
So, it's like illegal in the US now. And

889
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
and you know, and I want to do this and

890
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,399
and they're like, "Okay." And and so

891
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,440
like you have to leave your job. I was

892
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,799
like, "Yeah." And then they obviously

893
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,080
got inflamed. They were like, "Well,

894
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,840
what are you talking about? Like these

895
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,360
guys are paying all this money. Like

896
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,720
what doesn't make any sense?" And and I

897
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,600
think like the thing that pushed us to

898
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,799
do it is like I I think I kind of like,

899
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,240
you know, some people make decisions

900
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,640
based on regret minimization. It's like

901
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,799
in 10 years, what part would I regret mo

902
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,880
most? And I just thought I would regret

903
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
if I hadn't done it. I just thought like

904
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,399
I would be very regretful if I didn't do

905
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,600
this or at least try or give it a shot.

906
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,200
And so I I I just had to do it. And then

907
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,000
I really like the idea. I just like

908
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,279
really love like I love the idea of

909
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,279
basically creating a market where you

910
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,120
can price anything and making the world

911
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,559
just smarter about the future. Um

912
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,480
so then like okay like what did we

913
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,640
actually do?

914
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,640
uh

915
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,760
the the simplest way to describe

916
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,000
like like what it takes to build a

917
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,360
company. So, so Mark Anderson has this

918
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,720
code, I forgot if it's Mark Anderson or

919
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,399
Ben Harwoods, one of the 286C guys, um,

920
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,200
about how like when he talks about to a

921
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,360
lot of CEOs, he basically has this kind

922
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,960
of whole thing about like all the, you

923
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,480
know, the the the pretty like the good

924
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,679
CEOs usually respond with like, okay,

925
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,240
like when he asked them, "How did you do

926
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,799
it?" They say, you know, it was like a

927
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,640
great strategy, uh, you know, great sort

928
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,799
of execution, we had all these great

929
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,200
decisions, blah blah blah blah blah. And

930
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,399
then he says, "The absolute great CEOs

931
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,960
um usually their answer is um is we

932
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,200
didn't give up. We just we just pushed

933
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
harder than anyone else." And and I I

934
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,480
think there's a lot of truth to that. I

935
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,399
I really do. Like because like when

936
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,519
you're young, like people say, "Well,

937
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,360
when you're young, you have to wait and

938
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,399
get experience to build a company." And

939
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,440
there's pros and cons to both. When

940
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,120
you're too experienced, I think it's

941
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,000
harder to be to be a little crazier and

942
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,519
do like bolder, crazier ideas. Uh but

943
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
when you're younger, you kind of don't

944
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,240
know much about anything really. Like

945
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,640
you don't know how to manage people. you

946
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,320
don't know how to uh you know raise

947
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
money. you don't do any and you just

948
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,880
have to stumble like you just have to

949
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,360
kind of like run and and fall and then

950
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,480
stand back and run and fall again and

951
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,159
stand back and then you do it enough

952
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,440
times then you get used to falling and

953
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,119
then getting used to falling is actually

954
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,159
one of the best superpowers you can ever

955
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,480
have literally like I think the the

956
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,919
capacity to kind of fall and stand back

957
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,679
up I think is the single best

958
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,520
determinant of the entrepreneurs that go

959
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,079
furthest really and and you can look at

960
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,760
it even you don't need to look at small

961
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
private companies like or big private

962
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,079
companies you can look at public like

963
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,760
massive large companies like you know

964
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,440
just look at the stock price of Meta and

965
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
Tesla and see how it goes. It's never

966
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,879
it's just not straight to the right.

967
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,800
It's you know goes to the [ __ ] for a

968
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,760
few years then goes back up and then it

969
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,280
it repeats and and every cycle it goes

970
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,320
higher than the prior cycle and they

971
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,079
keep going. So, so I I think that's

972
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,280
really what it is. And I I you know kind

973
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,639
of when I think about sort of my younger

974
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,720
self like what is the type of advice I

975
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,399
would give you know I I think take more

976
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,920
risks and this one of the things I

977
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,760
learned a lot from my co-founder Lana

978
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,280
like she's always she's always been risk

979
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,160
loving. She never really really worried

980
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,440
about much. I I was more of like a

981
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,960
person that would think about optimizing

982
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,440
my career and what's the highest

983
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,079
expected value path and like you know

984
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,680
how how and what I learned over time

985
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,119
from the company from earlier is like

986
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,599
actually you just need to take more

987
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,839
risks just taking risks is a very good

988
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,119
is a is a very good way to live a life

989
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,640
because like what's the worst case you

990
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:31,280
fail and then you do it again um

991
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,280
and um I I would say number two is like

992
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,119
um pick something and just stick with it

993
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,400
like just try to pick something. If you

994
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,680
don't know what it is yet, that's okay.

995
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
Like, take a few years to figure that

996
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,880
out. But once you feel like you really

997
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,160
like and enjoy working on something, you

998
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,800
just pick pick something and just stick

999
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,839
with it. Like, just go for it and, you

1000
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,599
know, have conviction. Um, and usually

1001
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,960
the results the results end up being

1002
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,440
pretty positive. It's a very very tough

1003
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,119
road. I mean, Professor Gaming can tell

1004
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,880
you about all a lot of the stuff we had

1005
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,079
to go through to get here. It's a very

1006
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
tough road, but if you have conviction,

1007
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,200
you're excited about what you're working

1008
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,800
on, I think you can get very very far.

1009
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,280
>> That's great. So, did did you ever set

1010
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,720
in your mind like um essentially like a

1011
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
stop loss where you thought like right

1012
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
well if this person like you know I've

1013
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,359
asked I've asked this many people if

1014
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,720
this person says no maybe it's not

1015
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,000
actually possible or did you just never

1016
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,000
have that in your mind you just kept

1017
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
going

1018
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,119
>> you know what I' what I've learned um

1019
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,640
not really basically I mean like

1020
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,000
definitely not like a people driven

1021
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,400
thing like like what I've learned is

1022
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,720
like also a lot is like don't don't

1023
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,160
really listen to authority figures. Like

1024
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,240
you'd be surprised by the extent to

1025
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,440
which like

1026
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,359
people just don't really know what

1027
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,359
they're doing. And and by people I mean

1028
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,359
like not like average I'm talking like

1029
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,480
like the president of the United States

1030
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,119
like the the the Supreme Court judge,

1031
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,640
the you know Elon Musk, like like Mark

1032
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,000
Zuckerberg, like people don't really

1033
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,160
know what they're doing really like

1034
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,520
everyone is figuring it out on the fly.

1035
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,440
And it's interesting because like

1036
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,040
if anyone had the answer of whether

1037
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,920
something is going to be a multi-billion

1038
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,880
dollar company, sorry about the noise by

1039
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,920
the way. Um if anyone had the answer of

1040
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,320
if anything was going to be a

1041
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,839
multi-billion dollar company, they would

1042
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,200
just do it like why like you know why

1043
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,119
why didn't they just do it? So so in a

1044
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,359
lot of cases like you cannot really get

1045
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,720
the answer from outside. Like it's it's

1046
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,400
interesting like you really can't you

1047
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,320
just have to have it have it inside you

1048
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,240
and you may be wrong. That's a risk. You

1049
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,760
may be wrong and you may fail and it

1050
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,760
might suck but that's a risk that you're

1051
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,880
taking and um um but it has to come from

1052
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,680
within you. It's like do you have a

1053
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
conviction in this thing and do you

1054
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,240
believe it it can work one day and if

1055
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,560
you do then you know go for it.

1056
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,640
>> That's amazing. Thank you so much.

1057
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,320
>> So Tar, if I could just chime in there.

1058
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,280
I think what uh Tar

1059
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,359
um has is passion,

1060
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:56,880
um persistence

1061
00:37:51,359 --> 00:38:00,320
and energy and you know knowing how hard

1062
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,599
he worked and how inspiring he was um

1063
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,079
that inspiration you know led to

1064
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,839
significant investments from top people

1065
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,000
in finance and so you know I think it's

1066
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,200
you know a testament to those

1067
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,320
characteristic He mentioned also um it's

1068
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,920
a great uh benefit to have a good

1069
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,440
partner and Lana Lopez Laura really I

1070
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,280
think is a great uh partner with Tar and

1071
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,599
they've uh helped each other achieve

1072
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,599
this. though.

1073
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,880
>> Yeah. No, I really appreciate I mean

1074
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
maybe like my last few kind of parting

1075
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,040
words unless there's any other

1076
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,240
questions. I mean I think like

1077
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,119
um you know kind of I was still at MIT

1078
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,440
and I don't know how many of you are

1079
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,359
sophomores, freshman, juniors, seniors.

1080
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,440
But here's all the stuff I would tell

1081
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:54,160
myself if I was still at MIT. Like um I

1082
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,800
would take more classes like Peter's

1083
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,720
class and less classes that are sort of

1084
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,280
purely theoretical and like far removed

1085
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,800
from from practical many practical

1086
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,560
things. Um I would probably study a

1087
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,599
little less and have a little bit more

1088
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,800
fun. Um, and I would worry a little bit

1089
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,400
less about the opt optimal career paths

1090
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,040
and just sort of explore what interests

1091
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,400
me more. Um, it's it's crazy the extent

1092
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,160
to which a lot of these things matter,

1093
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,599
much less than you think. And um uh uh

1094
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,119
and a lot of life is just actually

1095
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,160
trying things out and seeing what works

1096
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,599
and just making sure you're excited

1097
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,680
about the things that you're working on.

1098
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,760
Um, but yeah, if you guys have any

1099
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,720
questions, reach reach me. Just please

1100
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
don't share the email, but it's

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,000
know, congrats to to you guys making it

1106
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,920
to MIT and hopefully get out of MIT. Um,

1107
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,119
and really excited to to be here. Thank

1108
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,359
you for having me.

1109
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,800
>> T, before you go, I have to ask you this

1110
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,280
question. Uh, what was the most

1111
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,359
memorable thing you learned from this

1112
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,160
class when you took it? And do you

1113
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,960
recall anything, you know, interesting

1114
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,040
you heard from this class?

1115
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,359
advice to the students. Yeah,

1116
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,960
>> I I I I think I think there was like I

1117
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,440
really like that every mathematical

1118
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,040
concept had an application towards

1119
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,040
finance

1120
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,160
and and I think there was like a very

1121
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,920
probable thing essentially like it was a

1122
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
very very probable thing was like okay

1123
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,960
well you know you kind of learning this

1124
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,240
mathematical concept it's pretty cool in

1125
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,400
of itself but then when you apply it to

1126
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,160
finance you see there's likeual real

1127
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,320
practicalities to the whole thing um and

1128
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,680
um I think that stuck with me like I I

1129
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,880
that that because a lot of the other

1130
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,880
classes I was taking was basically

1131
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,720
mostly pure math or like you know kind

1132
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,240
of very removed from industry whereas

1133
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,760
here like I remember one of the projects

1134
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,839
we had to do was um there was this paper

1135
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,760
we had to write

1136
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,960
u um and I think the one I wrote it's

1137
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,440
been a while it's been like I don't know

1138
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,880
now like six years seven years but the

1139
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,480
paper I had to write was um

1140
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,599
we were running some form of regression

1141
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,720
it's kind of complicated form of

1142
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,000
regression on on

1143
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,599
Now I remember I wrote a paper that was

1144
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,480
trying to kind of use reinforcement

1145
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,079
learning to predict the stock market. Um

1146
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,720
and it was like I think our final paper

1147
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,800
of the class and

1148
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,160
that was pretty hard. I I don't think

1149
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,440
our model worked as you would expect. Uh

1150
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,880
but it was really interesting just

1151
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,720
trying like I think that was very useful

1152
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,839
after when I got went into trading like

1153
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,200
you know people would be talking about

1154
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,480
like markup chains and like how they

1155
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
wanted to apply them at Citadel and I

1156
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,000
kind of had already done that in the

1157
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,720
past and and had already applied them

1158
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,400
and when I used it at Citadel you know

1159
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,000
um the P like holy [ __ ] this guy's a

1160
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,760
genius I'm like you don't know anything

1161
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,400
like that people do this every day you

1162
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,000
know um and that was the next MIT guy by

1163
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,280
the way who's now you should Google him

1164
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,160
John Termas he's one of the most

1165
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,200
successful portfolio managers on on on

1166
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,680
Wall Street um you know like one he's

1167
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,800
he's a G like totally this this desk is

1168
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,960
one of the best performing desks at

1169
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,200
Citadel um the reports is that

1170
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,800
apparently they made $2 billion in 2022

1171
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,160
alone and they've been making more since

1172
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,119
then and then they were impressed by

1173
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,680
some of the stuff that I learned in this

1174
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,079
class that I was applying on the desk so

1175
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,119
um and I think this goes to kind of the

1176
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,280
broader thing that I was I was

1177
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,760
mentioning like I think it's just good

1178
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,520
to be practical just just very good to

1179
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,200
be practical like get very very smart

1180
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,599
but also be practical because a lot of

1181
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,720
the world is and you see it left

1182
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,240
like like the people that have run

1183
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,599
the largest company, even the largest

1184
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,359
hedge funds are not exactly the

1185
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,960
smartest. Maybe Jim Simons is like an

1186
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,880
exception, but they're not exactly the

1187
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,839
smartest. LTCM blew up and those were

1188
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,119
the smartest guys. Um, you know, um, a

1189
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,480
lot of the others like Steve Cohen and

1190
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,040
and some of the others, they're pretty

1191
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,480
smart, but they're more well-rounded.

1192
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,480
They're just more much more wellrounded

1193
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,599
than just being the best at math. and

1194
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,000
and and I think there's a lot of

1195
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,000
learning to that.

1196
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,079
>> Great. Thank you.

1197
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,240
>> Well, great. Well, thanks thanks so much

1198
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,680
for having me everyone and hopefully

1199
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,400
we'll catch up soon.

1200
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,560
>> Great. Thank you very much, TK.

1201
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,560
>> Thank you.

1202
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,640
But um but I think his his comments

1203
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,119
about

1204
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,400
um basically having passion and

1205
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,319
persistence and energy you know you can

1206
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:28,160
really achieve many things and achieve

1207
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,560
your dreams. So uh I do want to you know

1208
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,079
encourage you all to you know take stock

1209
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,200
of that. Um and just as a general

1210
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,800
comment about my career, um I started

1211
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,599
off in academics and then found

1212
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,839
consulting projects to be very

1213
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,880
stimulating and engaging and I decided

1214
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,480
to leave academics and start my own

1215
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,480
company and ended up uh starting a

1216
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,560
couple of hedge funds and then doing

1217
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:02,160
investment management for 20 years. Um

1218
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,000
then uh 10 years ago I uh had the

1219
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,200
opportunity to come back to MIT and

1220
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,160
teach and I've been savoring that uh

1221
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,480
experience as well. So um don't be

1222
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,920
afraid of changes in your life and you

1223
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,720
know changing your paths and uh you know

1224
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,000
taking risks you know leads to great

1225
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,000
opportunities. So

1226
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,040
hopefully you'll all benefit uh from

1227
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,040
that kind of uh perspective. All right.
