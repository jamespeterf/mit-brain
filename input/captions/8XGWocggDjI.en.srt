1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,719
in this video let us look at an

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,279
application of the probabilistic method

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,439
to graph Theory we'll prove what is

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,480
known as The Crossing number inequality

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,560
now what is the Crossing number of a

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,439
graph if I give you a graph sometimes

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,439
it's possible to draw the graph on a

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,040
plane without Crossings for example the

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,960
complete graph on four vertices can be

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,800
drawn on the plane without having any

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
pair of edges cross such graph is called

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,480
a planer

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,719
graph but sometimes it's not possible to

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,399
draw such a graph on a plane and the

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,559
classic example of such a graph is K5

16
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,039
the complete graph on five

17
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,960
vertices and then in that case maybe you

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,840
want to know what's the minimum number

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,320
of edge Crossings you can have in any

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,239
possible drawing of this

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,119
graph so the Crossing number of a graph

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,119
is defined to be the minimum number of

23
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,680
edge Crossings of a drawing of G of this

24
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,560
graph G on a plane using continuous

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,600
curves as

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,640
edges it is a classic fact that K5 the

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,880
complete graph on five vertices does not

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,159
have a planer drawing but it is possible

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,200
to draw this graph using only one

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:31,280
Crossing and we can do this by adding

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,079
one vertex to this K4 drawing and draw

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,280
edges like this and the final Edge we

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,560
need to do a crossing over

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,040
here okay so this example illustrates

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,640
that the Crossing number of K5 is

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,280
one if you give me a graph with lots and

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,759
lots of edges should I expect that its

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,880
Crossing number is necessarily

39
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,640
High turns out that's what the Crossing

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,280
number inequality always

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,600
guarantees the theorem says that in a

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,079
graph G with vertex set e vertex set V

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,400
and Edge set e

44
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,480
if e this Edge set is at least four

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,959
times the number of

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,360
vertices then the Crossing number of G

47
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,160
is at least the following quantity so on

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,879
the order of the number of edges cubed

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,400
divided by number of vertices squared

50
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,800
here C is some constant some absolute

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,519
constant

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
okay so this is a theorem that we'll

53
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:40,959
prove in this video before proving it

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,239
let me illustrate U one Cory to uh yeah

55
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,040
let me stay one Cory to illustrate how

56
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,040
to think about this

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,800
result

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:57,800
if the number of edges in this graph

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,360
is on the order of the number of

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,080
vertices squared so

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,560
this notation here means that it is

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,799
larger than some

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,519
constant v^ 2 so here C doesn't have to

64
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,280
be the same as a c

65
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,640
earlier

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:20,280
then plugging this hypothesis into the

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,879
theorem we obtain that the number of

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Crossings of G

69
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:31,760
is at

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,760
least on the order of V to the 4th power

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,519
so if has a lot of edges then the graph

72
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,319
must have a lot of Crossings and in fact

73
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,640
this is the right order of magnitude

74
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,519
because you can only have at most e s

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,080
number of Crossings each pair of edges

76
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,720
cross at most

77
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,280
once even if you just lay out all the

78
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,920
vertices in general position on the

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,920
plane and draw the edges at straight

80
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,760
lines okay so in the rest of the video

81
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,439
let me demonstrate the proof of the

82
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,439
Crossing number

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,519
inequality I'll split the proof into

84
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,199
three

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,199
steps the first

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:31,720
step is an analysis of planer

87
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,720
graphs namely graphs with no Crossing

88
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,160
the following turns out to be true that

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,600
if G is a planer

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,320
graph so planer means that it is

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,440
possible to draw G in the plane without

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,680
Edge

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,639
Crossings then okay so in other

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,320
words The Crossing number of G is equal

95
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,880
to zero okay so then the conclusion is

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,120
that the number of edges of G is at most

97
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,880
three times the number of

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,479
vertices another way to say the

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,960
conclusion is that the average degree of

100
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,960
this graph is at most

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,280
six this conclusion can be

102
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,080
deduced

103
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,639
from a fact from topology known as

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,639
Oilers

105
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,960
formula which says that if you draw the

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,720
graph in the plane in some way so for

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,759
example this is some

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
drawing then the number of vertices

109
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,440
minus the number of edges plus the

110
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,120
number of faces equals to two here by

111
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
face we count each individual cell as

112
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,280
well as the outside cell so this drawing

113
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,639
has three

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,199
faces and it has four vertices and five

115
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,720
five edges and you can verify that this

116
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:07,080
Oiler identity is true in this case but

117
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,319
it is also true in

118
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,440
general starting with Oilers formula we

119
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,680
can then put some bounds on the number

120
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,680
of edges and faces and vertices relating

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,360
them to each other using some

122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,319
inequalities to derive this conclusion

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,680
and so let me not do that step I refer

124
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,000
you to the lecture notes if you want to

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,000
see the

126
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,560
details the second step of the pro

127
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:45,360
Pro allows us to go from one Crossing to

128
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,360
many Crossings

129
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,759
okay so here's what

130
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,759
happens so

131
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,560
given a graph

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,720
G it may not be planner so maybe it will

133
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,000
require some Crossings to draw G in the

134
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,080
plane but starting with such a Crossing

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,120
we can delete some edges to make it

136
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,120
planer right so given G

137
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
by

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,199
deleting The Crossing number of G

139
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,400
edges we

140
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,240
can make

141
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,599
it pler okay so if you had so an earlier

142
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,360
example of K5 where this is not planer

143
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,199
but there's only one Crossing and by

144
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,560
deleting one of the edges corresponding

145
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,560
to that

146
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,240
Crossing and we remove one Edge and we

147
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,560
end up with a planer

148
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,440
graph well in this planer graph the

149
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,759
inequality in step one must be satisfied

150
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,240
so the number of edges of G minus The

151
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,520
Crossing number of G so these are the

152
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,159
deleted

153
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,720
edges must be at most three times the

154
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,720
number of vertices of

155
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,720
G

156
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,680
rearranging this

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,440
inequality we obtain the lower

158
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:27,440
bound on the Crossing

159
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:31,400
number being the number of edges minus 3

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,400
* the number of vertices

161
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,039
so the idea here is really to go from

162
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,240
one Crossing namely that if this

163
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,880
inequality e less than equal to 3 V is

164
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,680
not satisfied then we get at least one

165
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,560
Crossing but then keep on deleting these

166
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,440
Crossings we can go from one Crossing to

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,720
many

168
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Crossings let's pause and examine this

169
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,800
bound that we just proved it is a valid

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,120
bound but it's not that great for

171
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,440
example in this corollary when e is

172
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,279
under the order of quadratic and number

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,920
of vertices the conclusion that we will

174
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,040
get at this stage is also quadratic in

175
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,519
the number of vertices which is not as

176
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,600
high as we would like which is the

177
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:19,360
fourth power in the number of

178
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,399
vertices so this brings us to the

179
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,440
third step and this is a step where

180
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,120
we'll use the probabilistic method and

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,279
this step I'll call the bootstrapping

182
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,240
step where we go from a weak bound to a

183
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,920
much stronger Bound by using

184
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,160
sampling in this step

185
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,959
let's consider some P while decide this

186
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,279
P later on so to be decided but it's

187
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,279
some number between zero and

188
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:57,360
one and let's consider a subgraph of G

189
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:01,320
obtained by keeping

190
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,320
every vertex

191
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,200
of

192
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,200
G

193
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,200
with

194
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,920
probability P independently at

195
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,800
random and deleting the other vertices

196
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,279
when we delete the other vertices we

197
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,440
also throw away all the edges that are

198
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,440
adjacent to the deleted

199
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,880
vertices this process then produces a

200
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,760
different graph G

201
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Prime which contains a subset V of

202
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,320
vertices those V Prime so those are the

203
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,560
vertices that are kept by this random

204
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,560
process and then V and then e Prime is a

205
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,839
set of edges that were kept namely the

206
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,399
edges of G that fall between the

207
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,920
remaining vertices in V

208
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,680
Prime let's think about this graph G

209
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,040
Prime here well it is a graph so

210
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,279
whatever we proved in step two still

211
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,440
applies to this smaller

212
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:24,880
graph namely The Crossing number of G

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Prime is at least the number of edges in

214
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,880
this G Prime minus three times the

215
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:37,680
number of vertices in this G

216
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:39,240
Prime okay so this is a true and valid

217
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,760
inequality

218
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,079
let's well remember that g is given as a

219
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,200
graph is deterministic but we introduce

220
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,399
some Randomness to produce G Prime G

221
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Prime is a random

222
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,760
graph so this inequality is true for

223
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,240
every instance of this random

224
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,079
graph but it's also Al true than in

225
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,880
expectation so let's take the

226
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,639
expectation of both

227
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,800
sides expectation on the left and the

228
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,199
expectation on the right which by linear

229
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:18,360
of expectations we

230
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:18,360
can distribute the expectation into each

231
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,720
term

232
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,760
okay let's think about the various terms

233
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,320
the easiest one to think about is the

234
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,160
expected number of vertices that remain

235
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,720
while each vertex is kept with

236
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:44,920
probability P so the expected number of

237
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,240
remaining vertices is p * the original

238
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,160
number of

239
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,480
vertices next the expected number of

240
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,959
edges well an edge is kept if both its

241
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,560
end points remain and the probability

242
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,839
that both its end points are chosen is

243
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,279
p^ s

244
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:07,560
so this quantity is p^2

245
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:11,000
time the original number of

246
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:15,000
edges and finally and the slightly

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,360
tricky one is the expected number of

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,199
Crossings now if I have a Crossing in my

249
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,199
original graph

250
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:33,920
G one way to go about thinking about G

251
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Prime is to what take the same planer

252
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,880
drawing take the same drawing of G on

253
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,519
the

254
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,600
plane and use that drawing for G Prime

255
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,279
so G Prime is obtained by keeping some

256
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,040
of the vertices and so if we use the

257
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:53,880
same drawings then this Crossing is

258
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,880
kept with probability P to the 4th

259
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,320
now G Prime is a different graph it's a

260
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,199
smaller graph so potentially there's a

261
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,560
different way to draw G Prime that

262
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,759
produces even fewer

263
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,000
Crossings but nevertheless we have an

264
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:35,240
inequality because we could have always

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,240
kept the cross the drawing from

266
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,399
G and so we do always have this

267
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,079
inequality here so so this inequality

268
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,519
comes from keeping the same drawing but

269
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,079
keeping in mind that it doesn't have to

270
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,959
be an equality because we could have

271
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,800
chosen a different drawing for G

272
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,959
Prime

273
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,920
okay so we derived this inequality here

274
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,079
and by bringing this P to the 4th power

275
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,240
to the other

276
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:09,959
side and rearranging we obtain the

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,600
inequality that the Crossing number of G

278
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:18,160
is at least P to Theus

279
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:22,079
2times the size of the edge set * 3 to

280
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,000
the pus 3 * the size of the vertex set

281
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,560
of

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,519
G

283
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,399
okay P was some parameter that we we

284
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,639
have yet to specify and from this

285
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,680
expression then we can optimize for the

286
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,519
value of

287
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:44,480
P so and one way to do this and because

288
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:49,360
we only look for a bound that is up to a

289
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,279
constant factor is to set P to be

290
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,120
four time the number of vertices divided

291
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,120
by the number of edges of the

292
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,519
graph and it is important here that the

293
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,279
hypothesis of the theorem the number of

294
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
edges is at least four times the number

295
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,839
of vertices so that this p is indeed

296
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,519
between 0o and one if P ended up being

297
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,240
some number bigger than one then this

298
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,079
proof would not have made sense it would

299
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,279
not make sense to choose with

300
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,519
probability bigger than one but p is

301
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,199
between zero and one so this makes sense

302
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,680
and with this choice of P continuing the

303
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:29,079
earlier expression we find that it is

304
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,079
equal to

305
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,720
1 over 64 * the number of edges cubed

306
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:40,360
divided by number of vertices squared

307
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,920
and that finishes the proof of the

308
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,399
result showing that the Crossing number

309
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,120
inequality holds with C being the

310
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,000
constant 1 over 64 although the precise

311
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
value is not so

312
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,639
important this is a beautiful

313
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:59,160
demonstration of the probabilistic

314
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,800
method and let me Recall review what

315
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,319
happened in this

316
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,280
proof first we looked at what happens to

317
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,720
planer graphs those with no Crossings

318
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,520
and here we derived some bound on the

319
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,160
number of edges that such a graph can

320
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,439
have and then we said that if you start

321
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,199
with a graph and then remove all its

322
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,400
crossings by removing one Edge according

323
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,079
to its each Crossing we can then deduce

324
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,840
some lower bound on the number of

325
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,080
crossings from the first step

326
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,120
then it gives us this fairly weak bound

327
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,520
lower bound on the number of

328
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,520
Crossings and the final step I think is

329
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,720
the most interesting mathematically is

330
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,640
this bootstrapping step where starting

331
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,039
from a fairly weak

332
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,960
bound we then take our graph G and

333
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,559
Sample it down to a smaller subgraph and

334
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,440
apply the weaker bound to the smaller

335
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,520
subgraph this allows us to boost the

336
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,559
weak bound into a much stronger bound

337
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,080
that turns out to be the what is claimed

338
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,400
in the result in the

339
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
theorem so this finishes the proof of

340
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
the Crossing number

341
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
inequality and it's just one of many

342
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,360
beautiful demonstrations of the

343
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,840
probabilistic method in combinatorics

344
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,840
and graph Theory
