00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,319
If you have a couple economist friends,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,640
you know that they don't get excited

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,599
very often. But one of the very few

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,519
things that gets economists excited is

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,920
the appearance of not just any

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
technology, but a general purpose

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,320
technology. And this is a high bar.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,039
These are the technologies that

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,760
interrupt and accelerate the normal

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,600
march of economic progress. And examples

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
of these are the steam engine which

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,679
kicked off the industrial revolution.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
About a century later, we started to

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,320
electrify things. The internal

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,480
combustion engine also merits this

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
category. And most recently, the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,239
appearance of the computer probably

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,879
qualifies as a general purpose

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,040
technology. So, here we are. It's very

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,360
early in the history of generative AI,

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,800
but I think it's pretty clear that this

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,600
technology is going to be very

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,520
pervasive. We're going to see it in I I

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,440
believe every industry.
