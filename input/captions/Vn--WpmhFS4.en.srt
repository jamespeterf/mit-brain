1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,840
good

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,600
afternoon

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,600
so here we

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:26,720
are and let's see where where we are we

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:30,880
have uh introduced this energy versus

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,600
entropy diagram to summarize Concepts

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,640
and we have obtained these important um

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,280
inequalities that I called generically

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,280
clavus

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,680
inequalities that essentially um talk

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,399
about say something about how much

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,320
entropy uh must be exchanged between two

13
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,039
systems if these two systems start in a

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,719
stable equilibrium States

15
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,320
and they need to exchange energy with no

16
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,320
other uh

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,320
effects

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,520
so if this is the curve for stable

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,960
equilibrium stat for system a and this

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,360
is for system B we suppose that the

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,640
system a starts in this state and that

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,799
we want to extract this much energy from

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
it and give it to system

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,600
B okay we realize that the there is no

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,680
way to since there are no States below

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,560
the initial State we need to extract

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,560
also some

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,680
entropy

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,520
uh

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,560
okay but the problem is that system B so

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,520
if we extract entropy from system

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,960
a uh that entropy can only go into

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,479
system B because there are no other

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,960
external effects

35
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,719
but starting from this state system B

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,239
and receiving this much

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,720
energy the amount of entropy that it can

38
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,200
accommodate is only this much which is

39
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,680
called s Max so that's the maximum

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,680
amount of entropy that needs to

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,160
accommodate whereas for system

42
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,480
a this is the minimum amount of entropy

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,599
that it needs to uh give to system be in

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,440
order to find a state with this lower

45
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,159
energy level so we are left with a

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,319
possibility of possible states that are

47
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:46,239
on these dashed lines for system a and

48
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:52,519
for system

49
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:55,840
B that U correspond to entropy transfers

50
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,640
within the range Allowed by these

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,440
constraints that we have described okay

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,239
so that turns out to

53
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:08,120
be writable as a couple of

54
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,200
inequalities the Claus traditional

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,640
statement is as we've seen it for

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,560
infinitesimal amounts of energy

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:20,879
transfers this is for finite but the

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:26,480
concept is the same uh so today I wanted

59
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,480
to talk about some traditional uh

60
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,280
results

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:37,360
uh and uh we still need to Define what

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,319
we mean by heat okay first of all we

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,720
Define what we mean by work so work is a

64
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,480
mode of interaction in which there is no

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,000
entropy transfer and no uh transfer of

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,000
amounts of

67
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:58,400
constituents

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,959
okay uh so that's for example what

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,480
happens uh in in a weight process in a

70
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,760
weight process

71
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,480
if during the entire process there are

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,959
no external

73
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,319
effects then the weight

74
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,799
process experiences

75
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,840
a the system experiences a work

76
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,400
interaction as you may read here it says

77
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,800
that the weight process may be a

78
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,360
diabatic we call a diabatic process a

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,720
process in which uh there are only work

80
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,039
interactions and then we say well a

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,160
weight process may be a diabatic why why

82
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:40,919
maybe and not is a diabatic well

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,160
because a weight process is uh a process

84
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,160
in which the only net external

85
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,440
effect is uh the lifting or or lowering

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,520
of a of a

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,759
weight the net effect but you could have

88
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,400
some temporary effects that are

89
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,400
initially done and then undone

90
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,120
uh and in thata which may not be

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,039
describable by lifting or lowering a

92
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,720
weight so in that case it's still a

93
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:14,360
weight process but uh during the uh the

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,800
process there were interactions that

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,080
were may not be uh

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,560
work but for Simplicity if you want to

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,360
fix ideas

98
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,560
uh a good example of diabatic process is

99
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:37,120
a is a weight process in which there are

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,120
no entropy transfers all along the

101
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:46,720
process anything that has an entropy

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,720
transfer we call it non work so non

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,400
work

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,199
uh is a very broad class of proc of

105
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,199
processes of types of

106
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,000
interaction and uh in this broad class

107
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,919
there is one limiting condition that we

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,520
call heat interaction so we will see in

109
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,800
a moment and why what's defining idea

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,680
behind what we call

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,319
heat

112
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,880
uh it is a limiting process and it

113
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:23,560
doesn't exhaust all the possible non

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,599
work interactions so not all non work

115
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,120
interactions are

116
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,319
heat and in fact I already anticipated

117
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
the the

118
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,199
the last time that

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,759
uh uh this during a heat

120
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:42,919
interaction we have a very well defined

121
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,880
ratio between the energy that is

122
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:49,319
exchanged that we call Heat and the

123
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,400
entropy that is exchanged and the ratio

124
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:57,440
is equal energy to over entropy is the

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,360
temperature at which that interaction

126
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
occurs so much that therefore in order

127
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,280
to characterize a heat interaction we

128
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,280
only need to say it's heat we

129
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,919
uh how much energy is transferred and

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,919
what is the temperature at which it is

131
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,280
transferred

132
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,639
but what's the defining

133
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,639
Criterion for

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,199
heat okay one way to put it is we

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,160
we want to Define an interaction which

136
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,080
is completely distinguishable from

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,639
work so an interaction in which these

138
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,319
two systems say system a and system

139
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,879
B exchange energy and

140
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:52,520
entropy and nothing no fraction of the

141
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,479
energy that is exchanged between the

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:59,639
two can be recognized as

143
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,440
work what does it mean all right we do

144
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,800
it operationally let's say that uh we

145
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,960
extract some energy uh from system

146
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,879
a and let's suppose that we intercept

147
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,680
that energy and before giving it to

148
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:19,960
B we feed it to some

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,840
Machinery some Machinery that will try

150
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:27,000
at its best to split that energy into

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,879
part that is recognizable as work and

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,120
the rest

153
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,519
okay so

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,000
this sometimes I mean traditionally you

155
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,000
would call it a Carno engine or let's

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,919
but let's call it cycling Machinery

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,200
cyclic because it U uh it has to return

158
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,519
to its initial State and so whatever it

159
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,000
does it's not because you consume the

160
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,160
machine but because of the operations of

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,160
the

162
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,160
machine okay so in this situation

163
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,399
suppose we extract this much energy and

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,720
this much entropy we fed it to the uh to

165
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,440
the engine to the Machinery how much

166
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,959
work can we extract well this is a

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
standard problem in thermodynamics that

168
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,720
gets solved by writing energy and

169
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
entropy

170
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,000
balances so we write energy and entropy

171
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:29,800
balances for the uh systems a and system

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,279
B uh we also assume that um

173
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:38,399
uh the system a and system B uh in begin

174
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,399
and end in stable equilibrium

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,880
States and we write this bunch of

176
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,200
equations if you count the equal signs

177
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,399
it's how many equations 1 2 3 four five

178
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,399
six seven eight

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,079
equations considering the initial

180
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,760
temperatures as fixed

181
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,920
parameters the variables here are the

182
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,920
valious entropy

183
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,959
exchanged and the energy and entropy

184
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:18,160
changes for system a and system

185
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,279
B so you can uh if you count them I

186
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,079
think there are

187
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,120
nine variables eight equations cannot

188
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,120
solve the system but you can solve it

189
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,360
solve it for a ratio of those two of of

190
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,959
two of those variables and we choose the

191
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,040
ratio that we are interested in uh

192
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,839
namely the work that has

193
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:45,480
been separated out of that

194
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:49,079
stream over the in Inlet energy Inlet

195
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,040
into the cyclic engine so and this ratio

196
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:56,600
as we all know because we've all taken

197
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:00,160
thermodynamics before it's the carau

198
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,040
ratio uh between the uh two initial

199
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,639
temperatures of uh these

200
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:11,839
systems okay so this says that if these

201
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,839
two temperatures are

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,920
different this ratio is not

203
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,399
zero it's a definite

204
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:27,160
number it could be suppose the system B

205
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,839
is at 300 K 6 ma is at 600 K this is 300

206
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,040
over 600 is a half so

207
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,760
-2 is 50% all right so that means that

208
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,279
uh the cyclic engine here could split

209
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:44,519
50% of the received energy from a and

210
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:46,399
make it uh go into the work

211
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,320
Channel

212
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:54,079
sure if we want to uh complete the the

213
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,079
job once uh we have split this energy

214
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,360
and give it to the weight then we take

215
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,760
the weight back and give that energy to

216
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,639
system B so the end result is the same

217
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,399
we transfer the energy from A to B with

218
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,839
no external effects but in between we

219
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,000
manage to recognize a part of what What

220
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,279
flows from one system to the other as

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,279
work that's not what we want to call

222
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,800
heat we will call heat only in the limit

223
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:28,000
in which this ratio goes to

224
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,920
zero and that goes to zero only in the

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,920
limit in which the two

226
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,120
temperatures get equal or very close to

227
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
one

228
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,800
another and

229
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,880
U in terms of that train of inequalities

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,720
that we have seen the cus inequality

231
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,519
last time uh that interval of values if

232
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,399
the two temperatures are equal shrinks

233
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:59,959
to a single value and therefore uh we

234
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,120
get a definite uh uh

235
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,600
entropy transfer for a given energy

236
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,639
transfer and that's how we get the

237
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:14,279
famous equation that Delta s the entropy

238
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,199
exchanged is the energy exchanged over T

239
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,199
So Q over

240
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,920
T and of course I have stressed it so

241
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,639
many times but we notice that we have

242
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,320
defining heat here using

243
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,279
entropy usually it's the other way

244
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:40,440
around the traditional expositions start

245
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:43,519
from a uh some uh hand waving definition

246
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:48,000
of heat and then some definition of

247
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,600
temperature and then Q overt becomes the

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,800
entropy and that's the hand W I call it

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,040
the hand waving

250
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,519
euristic uh definition of

251
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:03,040
entropy that to be frank with you is

252
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,880
what got me started with this subject

253
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
because I was so unhappy of the way I

254
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,560
was explained the subject that I want

255
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,399
you to study

256
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,079
more it's funny you you you you hate a

257
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,800
subject because you don't understand it

258
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,279
and then you become to love it because

259
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,279
you no you want to understand

260
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:29,839
it all right but how does this

261
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:31,320
definition um match with our usual

262
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,959
understanding because if I ask you

263
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,639
what's heat well heat is the energy that

264
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,279
is transferred between our systems at

265
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,880
different temperature you would say well

266
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:47,560
we just said no heat is the energy is

267
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,560
transferred between systems at the same

268
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,880
temperature so is there something

269
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,959
wrong and in fact there isn't because

270
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,120
think of uh the typical model that we

271
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,120
adopt in uh heat transfer now suppose we

272
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,519
have two systems at different

273
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,320
temperature and we put them in

274
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,440
contact in the region of

275
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,440
contact

276
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,440
uh

277
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,199
there the their initial equilibrium if

278
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,320
they had the temperature initially as

279
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,759
soon as they go get in contact in the

280
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,440
region of contact you get non

281
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,440
equilibrium

282
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,440
situation but

283
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,720
we may

284
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,360
describe uh

285
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,040
this system as a composite of many

286
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,880
smaller

287
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,880
systems Fu mechanics you would call them

288
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,759
infinitesimal fluid

289
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,519
elements uh um in in a two-dimensional

290
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,440
problem you could have infinitesimal

291
00:15:52,519 --> 00:16:00,199
slices of your of your solid or

292
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:04,040
body uh and then then you may you may

293
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:06,480
assume that we'll return when we do non

294
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,880
equilibrium we return very much to this

295
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:18,360
idea but we we subdivide our

296
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:20,199
system uh in such a way that each local

297
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,680
subsystem it's still known in

298
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:26,440
equilibrium State not not but not too

299
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,120
but it is not too far from equilibrium

300
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,519
okay so it turns out that we can assume

301
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,519
that

302
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,800
U this is a what we do when we describe

303
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,399
a temperature

304
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,759
distribution in our

305
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,160
solid okay temperature distribution

306
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,639
means that there is a temperature at

307
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,759
each location so that means that each

308
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,600
infinitesimal element is close enough to

309
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,319
a stable equilibrium state that you can

310
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,880
assign the temperature of that stable

311
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:58,880
equilibrium state

312
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,400
okay and the fact that the temperature

313
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,640
distribution is typically except extreme

314
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,799
cases uh

315
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,199
continuous means that if you look at uh

316
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,839
uh from the small partitioning point of

317
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,679
view uh each element has a temperature

318
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,319
which

319
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,840
is differs only slightly from the

320
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:34,000
adjacent element and so on by continuity

321
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,039
so each lamina or each element is at a

322
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,080
temperature very close to the

323
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,120
temperature of the near of the

324
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,240
neighbor and therefore the interaction

325
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,720
between them is an interaction in which

326
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,960
there is exchange of energy and entropy

327
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,080
and in which the two uh adjacent

328
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,200
elements have almost the same

329
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,440
temperature which fulfills our

330
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,400
definition of a heat interaction so

331
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,720
locally it is a heat interaction at the

332
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,240
local temperature and then with the

333
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,480
other element it's another heat

334
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,640
interaction at the lower temperature and

335
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,640
so or higher temperature and so on

336
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:22,440
okay this describes what I just

337
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,440
said the for a say a

338
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:30,720
solid so suppose we concentrate on this

339
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,520
infinitesimal element of of solid or

340
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,799
Continuum in which uh um the coord is

341
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,280
only like say one dimensional coordinate

342
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,240
is between X and X Plus DX so it's

343
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,000
infinitesimal

344
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,440
thin and it is in

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,679
contact with the element to the left and

346
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,000
to the element to the to the right and

347
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:58,240
for simp Simplicity let's just study a

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,080
steady state situation here and make the

349
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,080
energy balance and the entropy

350
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,320
balance so if I make the energy balance

351
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,840
to this

352
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,240
lamina uh it's a I should put on the

353
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,720
left hand side the rate of change of uh

354
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,960
the uh energy of the lamina and on the

355
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,400
right hand

356
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,240
side the net contributions of the

357
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:29,360
interactions to which that lamina is

358
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:30,919
subjected so it receives a q dot that's

359
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,159
now I'm assuming it is a heat

360
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,919
interaction so it's ites a q Dot from

361
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:40,960
the left and it gives Q dot to the

362
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:44,559
right if the if what comes in to the

363
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,480
left and goes out to the right is

364
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,720
balanced same

365
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,120
rates the energy balance says that the

366
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,080
rate of change or the rate of

367
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,280
accumulation of energy of my system is

368
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,640
zero so that property doesn't change

369
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,640
with time

370
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,080
for

371
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,679
entropy the entropy balance should be

372
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,159
written this way uh left hand side the

373
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:17,880
rate of change of the property so the r

374
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:22,000
rate of change of the entropy of this

375
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,320
um see this is our system the

376
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,200
lamina on the right hand side I have two

377
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,960
terms the the terms having to do with

378
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,880
the net uh

379
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,960
entropy received by

380
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,799
interaction and the last term is the

381
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,440
entropy produced by

382
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,440
irreversibility within the

383
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:48,200
system

384
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,400
so from the left the entropy that is

385
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,880
received the rate of which entropy is

386
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,039
received is Q dot over T and T here is

387
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,400
TX T of location

388
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,400
X from the right

389
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,320
there is an outflow of entropy which is

390
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,919
Q over T but here the temperature is

391
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,520
different it's t at X Plus

392
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,000
DX

393
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,720
okay one with a plus because it's

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,200
entering one with the minus because it's

395
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,840
leaving and that's the entropy balance

396
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,279
so if we assume a steady

397
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,919
state steady state

398
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:28,880
means the state doesn't change with time

399
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,760
the state is what it's the properties so

400
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,240
the proper none of the properties

401
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,720
changes with time including entropy so

402
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,000
St State implies that the stdt is equal

403
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,840
to

404
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,159
zero

405
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:48,120
then using this expression we can

406
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,120
compute the entropy produced by

407
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,480
irreversibility and

408
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,120
uh

409
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,919
we we recognize here TX and TX Plus

410
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,720
DX if I divide that by DX that's an

411
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,640
incremental ratio so that's the

412
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,640
derivative of t with respect to

413
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,760
x uh

414
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,960
t^2 at the denominator so this is the

415
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,000
result it says that the entropy produced

416
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,480
by reversibility is proportional to the

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,559
heat that goes

418
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,960
through divided by t^2 then multiplied

419
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,559
by

420
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,600
the dtdx X is the gradient in

421
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:36,320
temperature in the X

422
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,679
Direction with the minus sign in

423
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,720
front so this tells us a few things

424
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,720
first of all it tells

425
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:51,799
us in which direction

426
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,159
Q can exist for a given temperature

427
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,880
distribution because the entropy

428
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,600
produced by irreversibility can only be

429
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,960
uh positive or zero if you if we were in

430
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:08,480
a reversible case but it cannot be

431
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,240
negative so it means that Q dot here I

432
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,400
have t squ so it means that Q dot must

433
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,279
have opposite sign uh of the gradi in

434
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,640
temperature so the Q dot flows in the

435
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,720
direction of decreasing uh

436
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:30,440
temperature which is of course what we

437
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,440
know what Claus told us uh uh

438
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,679
in another way the other

439
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,480
day the the point though is that uh

440
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,480
let's look at what uh what kind of model

441
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,080
we're doing by assuming by assigning a

442
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,080
temperature

443
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,600
here it's really an approximation that

444
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:58,039
we are making so in the in the whole of

445
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,200
heat transfery mechanics when we when we

446
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,600
make the local equilibrium assumption it

447
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
is an

448
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,360
approximation which is

449
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,000
good in order to assign local properties

450
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,960
like temperature pressure chemical

451
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,799
potentials to the fluid

452
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:25,080
elements but we should not take it too

453
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:27,200
literally because if we were truly in a

454
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,600
equilibrium

455
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,919
State this things couldn't happen and

456
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,159
look at it this way U let's say that

457
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:41,399
this is the E sucess diagram of my uh

458
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,399
system here the lamin the infinitesimal

459
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,760
element uh

460
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:51,600
now uh yeah I think I it bigger here

461
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,600
okay

462
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:59,559
now so the

463
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,559
state I I draw the state of this lamina

464
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,919
just a bit off the stable equilibrium

465
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,919
State

466
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,520
curve and let's see what happens there

467
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,520
okay so this is the

468
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,399
state the lamina receives both energy

469
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,399
and entropy from the

470
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,919
left so that energy and entropy from the

471
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:27,320
left that received from this side

472
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,919
Uh

473
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,960
u so the left hand from the left hand

474
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,120
side there is a pull that tries to put

475
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,080
this pull the state up because want to

476
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,039
receive

477
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:44,919
energy and to the right because it

478
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:47,520
receives an entropy given by q do/ t

479
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,760
Okay the

480
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,919
net result is that the state is pulled

481
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,919
in this direction it wants to move

482
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,279
there on the other hand

483
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,120
there is also an interaction to the left

484
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm sorry to the right which takes

485
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:12,760
things away it takes a energy down so it

486
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,200
pulls down the same amount so these are

487
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,159
balanced and therefore the state will

488
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,840
remain at this

489
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,880
level

490
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:28,960
but it pulls to the

491
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,039
left a different value because

492
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,080
the temperature is

493
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:38,039
different and here I at X Plus DX the

494
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,760
temperature I assume it's

495
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,039
smaller so this

496
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,919
ratio since it's a denominator smaller

497
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:51,520
than denominator means bigger so it

498
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:54,600
means that this pull uh to the left

499
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,919
is higher than the pool to the right so

500
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,440
there is an

501
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,600
unbalance and if if there were if there

502
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,640
weren't entropy produced by

503
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:10,000
irreversibility this state would follow

504
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:13,960
the imbalance and go backwards okay

505
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,240
so that to say that that is to say that

506
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,000
I need this

507
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,320
irreversibility to be produced locally

508
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,039
in order to maintain the steady state of

509
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,039
that fluid

510
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:32,000
element but in order to produce entropy

511
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,760
by r ibility I must not be at stable

512
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
equilibrium because at stable

513
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,600
equilibrium system is happy and it

514
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,760
doesn't uh uh rearrange things in order

515
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,840
it already it is in the maximum entropy

516
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:51,080
there is no uh tendency to produce

517
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,720
more so this is to say that

518
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,760
uh there is a bit of a

519
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,320
contradiction or at least that we have

520
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,799
to be careful in understanding what the

521
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,760
actual assumptions are this state is a

522
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,559
non equilibrium State otherwise it

523
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,880
couldn't produce entropy by

524
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,399
reversibility but it is close to a

525
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:15,320
stable equilibrium State and therefore

526
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,559
we can use uh the idea of

527
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,240
temperature and assign it to the fluid

528
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,159
element but indeed what it is is the

529
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,039
temperature that would be reached if I

530
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,120
took that fluid element and isolate from

531
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:32,559
the rest and let it relax to equilibrium

532
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,399
because if I shut the interactions left

533
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,399
and right this non-e equilibrium state

534
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:41,240
will

535
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:44,279
spontaneously move to stable equilibrium

536
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,600
and then it will have a

537
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:50,840
temperature and that's the temperature

538
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,840
that we assign to this non equum

539
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,760
State this is interesting

540
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,240
because it is the local equilibrium

541
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,480
model

542
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,120
that we are used to use in in in flu

543
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,200
mechanics

544
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,360
but you can

545
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,240
improve and people are doing uh

546
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,039
extensions of fluid mechanics treatment

547
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,799
in which you deal with this little

548
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:25,039
difference in entropy because uh maybe

549
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,080
you can assign a temperature but the

550
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,440
entropy of this state is slightly less

551
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,200
than this the temperature than the

552
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,320
entropy of a a truly equilibrium State

553
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,399
at that temperature and that difference

554
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,880
in

555
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,880
entropy does

556
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:50,039
some sometimes has

557
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,039
uh as as an importance for certain

558
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
applications

559
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:03,279
okay so now I want to uh talk about um

560
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,559
these

561
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,760
um very traditional ideas of heat

562
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,120
engines heat pumps and Refrigeration

563
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,279
units and see the energy and entropy

564
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,399
that flows and uh and also uh it gives

565
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:21,000
us the opportunity to Define what we

566
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:25,000
mean by first and second law efficiency

567
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
of devices like this

568
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,720
so let's start from what

569
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,880
we uh are seeing so let's do it uh our

570
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,080
own

571
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,200
way suppose

572
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,240
we we we take the closest inequalities

573
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,200
that we have seen the other day and

574
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,640
remember that these subscri

575
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,080
subscripts over the extreme

576
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,960
inequalities

577
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,880
uh indicate uh what the condition should

578
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,080
be for the strict equality to be to hold

579
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,480
and

580
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,639
here if you

581
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,720
remember we have an strict

582
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:18,000
equality if the system is in a stable

583
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,279
equilibrium State and ends in a stable

584
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,760
equilibrium State and it is a reservoir

585
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,600
so that the second derivative is equal

586
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,720
to

587
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,399
zero so

588
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,399
let's consider our system to be a

589
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:38,159
reservoir at temperature

590
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,480
ta I drop the subscrip one because for a

591
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,880
reservoir there is always one

592
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,519
temperature for all

593
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,639
states and let's assume that also system

594
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,240
B is a reservoir so also for B here I

595
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:51,240
have an equal

596
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,360
sign

597
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,639
okay uh because because I also assume

598
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,840
that the final states are stable

599
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:07,600
equilibrium all right so then either

600
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,279
this or that in if the two temperatures

601
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,760
are different and here we would like to

602
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:17,120
consider reservoirs at different

603
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,080
temperatures even large

604
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,519
differences

605
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:27,000
um there is no way that uh this left

606
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,799
extreme can be equal to the right

607
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,559
extreme and

608
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,039
therefore

609
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,039
somewhere there must

610
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:41,360
be uh some irreversibility either in

611
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,840
system a or in system

612
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:50,440
B so as to make this

613
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:54,039
uh things this train of equalities and

614
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,399
inequalities satisfied

615
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:59,799
so so it is necessary if I transfer

616
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:01,840
energy from a reservoir to another

617
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,159
Reservoir at a different temperature it

618
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,799
is necessary that some entropy be

619
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,480
generated by

620
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:11,519
reversibility uh in either one because

621
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,519
there are no other systems

622
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:15,320
around but suppose

623
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,799
we

624
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,399
interpose a

625
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,399
Machinery between that

626
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,919
exchange well in that case

627
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,760
it is

628
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:37,159
possible to have things uh to operate

629
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,200
without irreversibility so without

630
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,200
entropy uh

631
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,480
production this is the entropy balance

632
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,000
for the

633
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,080
Machinery it says that well if the

634
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,639
Machinery produces some um entropy by

635
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:04,320
reversibility it must be equal to the

636
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:07,000
difference between what it puts out from

637
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,000
what it

638
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,359
receives and uh this is the energy

639
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,359
balance for the Machinery it says that

640
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:23,040
uh it can produce work if it can

641
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:28,159
manage

642
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:32,679
to give to Reservoir B less and energy

643
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:37,760
than it receives from Reservoir

644
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,760
a okay so we

645
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,599
can

646
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,599
assume

647
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,079
that everything it is possible to assume

648
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:53,280
that everything has no entropy produced

649
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:57,720
by reversibility so

650
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,599
no no no Delta s here in system a no

651
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,599
Delta s ear in system B and also no

652
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,119
Delta s ear in system

653
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,040
X in that

654
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,520
case from the entropy point of view the

655
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,119
Machinery simply passes the entropy that

656
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,720
comes from Reservoir a and gives it to

657
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,720
Reservoir

658
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:24,079
B but it also recognizes that the

659
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:27,720
Machinery is made there just to

660
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,560
recognize that um in order to pass that

661
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,000
entropy to system

662
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,200
B it doesn't need to give it all the

663
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,760
energy it received from a there is an

664
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:44,320
unbalance difference which can be

665
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,160
um which which can be transferred

666
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,040
out by means of an interaction in which

667
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,040
there is no entropy transfer

668
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:59,640
work okay so that's the

669
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,640
idea of the Heat

670
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,079
engine Machinery that received

671
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,640
heat from a reservoir at high

672
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,319
temperature this is a heat engine

673
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,680
between thermal reservoirs because you

674
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:14,000
could have also heat engines between

675
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,359
systems that have that are not

676
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,960
reservoirs okay I take a a big uh piece

677
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:24,760
of Steel out of a steel making plant and

678
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,880
I want to recuperate the energy that it

679
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:33,599
has before it cools down that's way of U

680
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,880
um um recovering uh energy from

681
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,119
industrial processes and of course as I

682
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,400
cool it

683
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:44,400
down the the piece of Steel decreases

684
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,400
its temperature and so it's not a

685
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,960
reservoir that doesn't mean we cannot

686
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,680
compute also for that situation what is

687
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,960
the maximum work that you we can extract

688
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,240
but that's another

689
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,160
situation and for example the maximum

690
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,240
work we can extract in that case is not

691
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,079
the

692
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,160
carau

693
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,000
coefficient whereas here if you do

694
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:13,200
energy and entropy balances and here

695
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,640
they are uh I'm going sort of quickly

696
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,079
here I'm not going to into the details

697
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:22,200
just give you uh some ideas on by

698
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,920
following the flows of the entropy but

699
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:28,119
here are the full um glory of the

700
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,520
balance equations for um uh

701
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:34,720
for the

702
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,359
Machinery um from which you can

703
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,119
compute the

704
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,000
work okay here is the result so the work

705
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,680
that the Machinery the useful effect

706
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,480
that the machiner can produce is equal

707
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,839
to a

708
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,520
fraction of uh the heat that it receives

709
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:55,920
from the hot Reservoir and that fraction

710
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,760
is the caral

711
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,760
coefficient between those two

712
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,480
temperatures and then there is also a a

713
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,119
terms which detracts and that is

714
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,599
proportional to the entropy that is

715
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,560
produced by reversibility within the

716
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:17,760
Machinery it has a minor sign so if you

717
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,359
if the Machinery does produce entropy

718
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:25,720
that will detract and will will allow

719
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,720
you to get less work than the maximum

720
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:42,720
okay let's view it from the point of

721
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,960
view of entropy flows actually maybe we

722
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,960
can also do

723
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,960
it

724
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:57,319
uh in terms of uh e sucess diagrams

725
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,720
so this is system a reservoir

726
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,119
a and this is Reservoir

727
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:12,760
B and I'm extracting some

728
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:18,599
energy so I want

729
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,599
to take this much energy out of

730
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:32,359
his clearly there no stage here so I

731
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,280
need to extract also some

732
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:36,280
entropy at least this

733
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,359
much but in order to extract that

734
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,599
entropy I need another system that's why

735
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,119
I need the reservoir

736
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:56,319
B that picks up that

737
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,319
entropy and so it will end up here

738
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,960
it will end up

739
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,839
here provided uh since there are no

740
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,240
states to the right of the maximum

741
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:14,240
entropy uh I need also to provide some

742
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:18,119
energy and that energy is this much it's

743
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,119
Q uh received by

744
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:29,319
B okay so the difference between this

745
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,319
and that is the work you can also

746
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:36,280
if I if I draw a line with the slope of

747
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,280
of reservoir a

748
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,359
here this is the

749
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,960
work that I have extracted actually this

750
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:48,560
is W

751
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:53,680
rev because I have

752
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:58,119
assumed that system B takes just barely

753
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:01,000
the uh uh entropy that uh we need to

754
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:06,960
that is being received by System a so it

755
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:10,319
flows uh the entropy comes from uh from

756
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,560
a the Machinery doesn't add because it's

757
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,480
reversible it doesn't produce additional

758
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,079
entropy it simply as to uh transfer it

759
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,079
to system

760
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,280
B

761
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:30,200
and the energy that is required to

762
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,040
transfer uh uh that to system B is less

763
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,319
than QA and therefore there is a

764
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,200
difference and that difference can be

765
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,520
transferred in an interaction where

766
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,599
there is no entropy transfer which is

767
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,800
work so this is the reversible operation

768
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,599
if we have an irreversible operation so

769
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,400
if the Machinery is irreversible like

770
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,000
most practical machineries and therefore

771
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,000
it produces some entropy that entropy

772
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,200
will also need to be disposed of into

773
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,160
the uh environmental

774
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,480
Reservoir and therefore it will

775
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,960
require more

776
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,200
uh more energy to follow so in so the

777
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,160
system B I need to add not only this

778
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:21,040
entropy but also the entropy that is

779
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:23,319
produced by irreversibility so that is s

780
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,319
here produced in a machinery and the

781
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:31,760
Machinery is called M okay

782
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,760
so system B ends up

783
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:45,319
here the amount of u q is

784
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:48,480
higher and therefore the amount left the

785
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:54,040
difference which is what will be

786
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,040
transferred as work is less

787
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,559
okay good

788
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:05,400
so we have seen it in in various ways

789
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,400
now typically one defines the

790
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,920
efficiency

791
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,920
actually you

792
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,480
know uh most of you probably remembers

793
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:18,440
that

794
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,520
um this ratio is not called carau

795
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,200
coefficient like I'm calling it but it's

796
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:27,960
called carau efficiency okay which is

797
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,880
true in the sense that I can

798
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,400
define an

799
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,119
efficiency we are going to call it here

800
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,119
first low

801
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,920
efficiency as the ratio of the useful

802
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,319
work so the

803
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,760
work uh divided by uh the the energy of

804
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,599
the resource that you have used in this

805
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,400
case the resource is the hot Reservoir

806
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,520
so the energy extracted from the hot

807
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,920
Reservoir so this ratio is the first low

808
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,920
efficiency

809
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,920
and the result and the the result of the

810
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,079
energy balances shows

811
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:11,680
that U the the Caro coefficient is the

812
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:14,760
upper limit of this efficiency which is

813
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,359
reached when s here is equal to

814
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,640
zero so the car

815
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:26,280
coefficient is equal to the first LW

816
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,280
efficiency for the reversible engine

817
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:36,440
what is

818
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,440
somehow um inconvenient of first LW

819
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,800
efficiencies is

820
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:47,240
that you know usually want say if

821
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,359
something is 50%

822
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,480
efficient uh I would I would say oh why

823
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:58,319
why aren't you doing better no there

824
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,319
there is 50% room for improvement

825
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,400
uh not here though because uh there's no

826
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:11,079
way suppose you have a TA is equal 600

827
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,520
and 600k and TB is 300K so the carau

828
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,920
coefficient is 1 half

829
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,119
50% that's the maximum you can do

830
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:24,960
there's no improvement you cannot

831
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:28,960
improve so it would be better to have a

832
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,960
to call efficiency or to

833
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,920
so people have introduced the second low

834
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,880
efficiency which Compares what you

835
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,440
actually

836
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,640
obtain and put it in the numerator to

837
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,000
the maximum that you could have

838
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:49,040
obtained given the constraints and the

839
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,960
physical laws so without violating

840
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:57,119
anything uh okay so in that case this

841
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,400
ratio for the reversible uh case is one

842
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,640
so it's

843
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:06,400
100% And so if the efficiency is 100%

844
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,400
there's no room for

845
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:18,400
improvement if it is not uh 100% or one

846
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,040
it means that there is a something that

847
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,960
reduces that

848
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:27,079
and that something is the entropy

849
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,520
produced by irreversibility so uh by

850
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:33,240
thinking in these terms this second low

851
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:35,200
efficiency allows you to

852
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,839
identify uh the

853
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:43,880
actual

854
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:46,839
um places in your um Machinery or power

855
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:51,079
plant uh

856
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:54,200
that uh that are the the sites where

857
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,319
entropy gets produced by irreversibility

858
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,200
because that the higher the entropy

859
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:02,760
produced by reversibility the Lesser

860
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:06,920
this efficiency so the more room for

861
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,119
improvement and in fact a lot of energy

862
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,119
uh technology

863
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,079
engineering uh is

864
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,880
into uh improving this efficiency that

865
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,680
means identifying where the

866
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,119
reversibilities are and removing them or

867
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:26,280
reducing them optimizing from that point

868
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,280
of view

869
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:34,800
okay so let's

870
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,559
uh do even more

871
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,359
quickly uh the same idea but for a

872
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,359
refrigerator

873
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,559
unit it's again a situation in which I

874
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:50,640
have two reservoirs ta and

875
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:53,800
TB and uh

876
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,359
I identify the

877
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:01,520
environment as

878
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,520
the system at higher temperature

879
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,880
now

880
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,880
and the other

881
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,559
system at the lower

882
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:16,119
temperature is for example the

883
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:19,559
refrigerator cell the the the the room

884
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:22,040
in that you want to keep refrigerated so

885
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:25,400
and you want to keep it refrigerator so

886
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,839
it seem typically uh there are heat

887
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,319
losses from the walls of this uh uh

888
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,240
refrigerator you need to compensate by

889
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:37,160
removing

890
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,760
heat so the the unit wants to extract

891
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,839
heat from a low

892
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,599
temperature from a temperat from a

893
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:45,680
reservoir which is at lower temperature

894
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:45,680
than the uh

895
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,720
environment so if we go on our

896
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,559
uh do again

897
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,559
the

898
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,559
construction

899
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:11,520
here now I want I have my system B which

900
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:17,960
is the refrigerating refrigerator uh

901
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:21,720
room you want to uh extract

902
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:24,240
energy and uh as usual in order to

903
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,440
extract energy you need to extract also

904
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:31,079
entropy so this is QB

905
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,079
out and this is

906
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:36,720
s

907
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:42,359
the

908
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:48,160
out so if I have this entropy going uh

909
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:48,160
somewhere I need to put it to another

910
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:58,000
system now this system a which is my my

911
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,839
environment is there

912
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,880
and I would like to give

913
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,880
it uh this much

914
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,359
entropy but in order to give it I I also

915
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:17,359
need to give some uh energy which is

916
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,359
actually

917
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,640
higher than this

918
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,720
one because the the because it's the

919
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,599
environment is hotter so it has a higher

920
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:34,200
slope so if I plot here the

921
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:34,200
slope of system

922
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,760
B this is the the energy that I extract

923
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,760
from system

924
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:49,480
B

925
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,400
okay but I need to give to a more energy

926
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,079
in order for it to accommodate the

927
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,839
entropy that I must extract from B so

928
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,319
this much

929
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:02,000
is the

930
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,000
work that I need to

931
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,160
spend

932
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,640
okay and of course if the Machinery is

933
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,000
irreversible and it produces also some

934
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:21,520
entropy by irreversibility not only I'm

935
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,119
not I must accommodate this much entropy

936
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,960
but but I must

937
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,559
accommodate even

938
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,559
more that's the reversibility of the

939
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,359
Machinery this

940
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:40,760
much so system a must go up there and

941
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:43,240
therefore I need to spend more work so

942
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:50,839
this is what was W

943
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:50,839
rev and this much is W uh say IR

944
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:01,040
revers okay now also here

945
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,040
the Carno

946
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,160
coefficient or similar does play a

947
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,319
role

948
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,079
usually in practice when you buy a

949
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:16,440
refrigerator you

950
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:18,480
uh um you want to know what the cop the

951
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:23,680
coefficient of performance is which is a

952
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:26,280
first flow uh ratio it's the ratio of

953
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:28,359
the useful the cooling effect which is

954
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,000
the energy you extract from the low

955
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:33,119
temperature

956
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
cell to the uh

957
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:43,160
work typically electrical work that you

958
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,160
need to spend in order to uh this to do

959
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,040
this and this

960
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,079
cop has the highest

961
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:00,200
value and then there is a term which is

962
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,880
always is positive and that is bigger

963
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:06,359
and bigger the

964
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:09,359
more IR revers irreversible is your

965
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:09,359
Machinery

966
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:17,079
okay also here

967
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,079
cop is typically a number greater than

968
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,839
one doesn't give you an indication of

969
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,799
what

970
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:29,559
the room for improvement is

971
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:33,559
the second LW efficiency

972
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:37,839
instead does and again we can Define it

973
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:43,520
as the actual use useful effect divided

974
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:46,280
by uh the best uh useful effect the

975
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,240
maximum useful effect you could obtain

976
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,480
uh with a reversible

977
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:57,839
Machinery that

978
00:53:51,480 --> 00:54:01,020
two as a maximum value equals to one

979
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,960
100% in that case there is no room for

980
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,480
[Music]

981
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,880
improvement and it's less than one due

982
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,880
to the entropy produced by

983
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,160
diversability the last of these series

984
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,280
of

985
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,880
uh of

986
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,359
traditional uh machineries say is the

987
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,599
heat

988
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:28,400
pump the heat pump it's very similar to

989
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,640
a

990
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,359
refrigerator more or less the same

991
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,440
equations except that

992
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:40,880
now what switches is the position of the

993
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,240
environment of your environment the

994
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,839
environmental rest

995
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,760
OFW whereas for the

996
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:51,359
refrigerator you

997
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,160
were uh extracting energy from something

998
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:57,559
which is colder than the

999
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:02,000
environment in the heat pump you want to

1000
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:04,760
put energy in a a a reservoir which is

1001
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,760
hotter than the

1002
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,960
environment so now the environment

1003
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,960
system

1004
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,319
be but the idea is more or less the same

1005
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,400
that

1006
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:21,440
um except that the useful effect now is

1007
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,359
not the cooling of B but is the heating

1008
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,079
of a you want to heat up something like

1009
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:29,599
the house in a

1010
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:32,119
and using heat pump which is nowadays

1011
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,880
been done

1012
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:40,119
worldwide at least in places where you

1013
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:43,559
need Heating in the winter time

1014
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:46,480
and so the useful effect effect is QA

1015
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,920
therefore you define a different cop

1016
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,440
it's called cop but it's

1017
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,400
different different

1018
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,799
definition

1019
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,680
uh and uh

1020
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:02,200
this time you

1021
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:08,559
put in the numerator the useful effect

1022
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:11,319
which is the heat uh given to the

1023
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:14,880
hot

1024
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:18,240
system divided by the work that you have

1025
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,240
spent in order to do

1026
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,160
it and

1027
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:27,359
again the second law

1028
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,280
efficiency is the ratio

1029
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:32,920
between the useful

1030
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,680
effect of your actual machinery and the

1031
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,079
useful effect of the reversible

1032
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:41,000
Machinery so uh that uh it would be

1033
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,400
equal to one for a reversible machinery

1034
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and it's less than one if there is

1035
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:51,000
entropy produced by your Machinery here

1036
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
okay

1037
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,680
so since now we are talking about some

1038
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,680
practical

1039
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,280
aspects let's talk

1040
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,799
about

1041
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,720
uh another chapter of of themodynamics

1042
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:19,559
that has to do with establishing the

1043
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:22,039
properties of substances at stable

1044
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,280
equilibrium and let's see this is an

1045
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:27,280
important

1046
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,280
chapter uh

1047
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:36,440
many scientists have devoted their lives

1048
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,440
in constructing the properties of

1049
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,240
substances for

1050
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:46,079
example to

1051
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,640
stay

1052
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:53,359
uh here

1053
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:57,799
um Professor Kenan in

1054
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:59,920
1940 uh maybe earlier um spent a lot of

1055
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:05,319
time developing the steam

1056
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:08,799
tables which is uh the properties of

1057
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:12,319
water so how do we measure properties of

1058
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,319
substances in stable

1059
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:23,359
equilibrium well much of uh

1060
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:26,680
uh um the tools that we have is

1061
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,319
uh to is related to the the conditions

1062
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,039
for Mutual stable equilibrium that we

1063
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:33,000
have

1064
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,440
developed like equality of temperature

1065
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,960
equality of pressure the quality of

1066
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,960
chemical

1067
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,599
potentials the the good thing is that if

1068
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,599
you have a

1069
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,559
thermometer what is a thermometer

1070
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:54,839
thermometer is a is a

1071
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:59,079
system in which in some way you have um

1072
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:01,839
put a scale in which you can read uh uh

1073
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:04,079
the uh the value of the temperature then

1074
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:08,839
what you do you you you stick it in

1075
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,839
contact to the system you want to

1076
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:17,440
measure and

1077
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:19,319
uh you leave enough time so that you

1078
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,640
convince yourself that the two systems

1079
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:22,839
have reached the mutual equilibrium and

1080
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,599
if you are convinced that they are in

1081
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:27,480
mutual equilibrium then the theory says

1082
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,680
that the two temperatures are equal so

1083
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,559
by

1084
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,760
by uh

1085
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,880
reading the the temperature of the

1086
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,160
thermometer you have measured the

1087
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,440
temperature of system a of which you may

1088
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:42,400
know

1089
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:45,640
nothing so it's an indirect uh uh

1090
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,640
measurement of a

1091
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,799
property

1092
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,720
similarly the

1093
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,359
monometer you can construct the

1094
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,160
monometer as uh so that you can read out

1095
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:01,799
a scale

1096
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:05,039
uh the value here you put it in

1097
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:08,440
equilibrium Mutual equilibrium with your

1098
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:12,039
system by drilling a little hole in this

1099
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:17,000
uh in the boundary and uh and um with

1100
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:20,280
either a little piston or some um

1101
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,280
moving interface like

1102
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,280
here

1103
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:30,000
um if you're convinced that they are in

1104
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,000
mutual equilibrium reading the pressure

1105
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,920
of B gives you information about the

1106
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,760
pressure of system a so this is one way

1107
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,599
of measuring

1108
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,720
it

1109
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,079
yeah

1110
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:50,799
uh this is just to remind U of that

1111
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:57,799
proof that I don't want

1112
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:57,799
to go into details all but that it shows

1113
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:06,720
why the pressure can be

1114
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,720
measured by measuring a force per unit

1115
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:13,480
area

1116
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:15,160
anywhere in on the boundary of your

1117
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,720
system so you take the boundary of your

1118
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,280
system when it is in stable equilibrium

1119
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:23,079
drill a

1120
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:26,520
hole and substitute that piece of wall

1121
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:29,359
with the movable wall and then you find

1122
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:32,319
a force per unit area that keeps that

1123
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:34,839
wall where the original one was once you

1124
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:37,559
found it that you have measured the

1125
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:40,280
force per unit area that

1126
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:42,359
balances the pressure pressure of your

1127
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,960
system and when you are in stable

1128
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:48,079
equilibrium that Force per unit area is

1129
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,720
equal no matter where you go and do this

1130
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,720
uh

1131
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:56,839
procedure whereas off

1132
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:59,319
equilibrium it can be

1133
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:05,720
uh you can always measure force per unit

1134
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:07,799
area but it may be non uniform not equal

1135
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:10,599
everywhere and there is no pressure

1136
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:10,599
because you're not in

1137
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,839
equilibrium

1138
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:19,200
other another kind of measurement that

1139
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,640
we

1140
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:27,839
can

1141
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:31,760
do is like uh uh the so-called Jew

1142
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:35,039
apparatus in which you input some

1143
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,599
mechanical energy in your substance or

1144
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:40,799
in

1145
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:45,119
your in a piston or in a in a variable

1146
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:48,319
volume or in a constant volume container

1147
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:52,160
you put some energy in

1148
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:57,520
wait for the system to go to a new

1149
01:02:52,160 --> 01:03:02,960
stable equilibrium and measure uh

1150
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:06,480
how much um they measure the how much

1151
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,640
the temperature has changed for your

1152
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,480
system

1153
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:15,680
so mg Delta Z represents the ra the

1154
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,279
amount of energy that you have put in in

1155
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:22,359
the form of of work so you produce a

1156
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:26,160
work interaction uh and put energy into

1157
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:28,279
your system let it relax towards uh

1158
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,279
until it reaches equilibrium so new

1159
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:31,720
temperature compute the difference

1160
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:35,079
between the new temperature and the

1161
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:38,480
initial temperature delta T this ratio

1162
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:40,240
turns out to be equal to this the

1163
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,960
partial derivative of this property that

1164
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,559
we we're going

1165
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,319
to Define in the moment and that's

1166
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:50,160
that's the property that we call heat

1167
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:53,000
capacity at constant pressure it's a

1168
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:57,359
stable equilibrium State Property we

1169
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,359
obtain it from the fundamental relation

1170
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:04,640
there is one heat capacity uh for for

1171
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,960
when that is equal to the same ratio

1172
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,000
when you do the experiment at constant

1173
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:14,160
volume and there is another heat

1174
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,160
capacity when you do it at constant

1175
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,599
pressure so let's start from the

1176
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:23,160
constant

1177
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:26,160
pressure because G this gives us also a

1178
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,160
procedure

1179
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:34,039
to

1180
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:36,760
Define um the enthalpy so and to get to

1181
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:40,359
this derivative

1182
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:42,240
that turns out to represent this result

1183
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:44,480
of this measurement so it's important

1184
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:47,359
because it is the way in which you

1185
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,359
measure that

1186
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:57,480
property Let's Do It um starting from

1187
01:04:53,720 --> 01:05:01,920
the fundamental relation in energy

1188
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,920
form and this is its

1189
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:06,160
differential so

1190
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:13,760
H in a moment we will see that um this H

1191
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,920
is a

1192
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,599
particular uh transform of the

1193
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,000
fundamental relation which when we

1194
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:24,760
change variables but for the moment

1195
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:28,200
let's just take it for um as a abrupt

1196
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:31,000
definition let's say that we call H the

1197
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:34,839
sum of energy plus the product of

1198
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,839
pressure and volume we call it

1199
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:44,839
enthalpy then by taking the differential

1200
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:46,720
of this expression and recalling that

1201
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:51,760
the differential of a product is equal

1202
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,760
to P DV plus

1203
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:59,240
VDP and where I see da I

1204
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,119
use the differential that I have written

1205
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:03,319
up here so I substitute and this is what

1206
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:06,160
I'm left

1207
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:09,039
with from this

1208
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,880
expression I can view this

1209
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:15,000
expression as a the

1210
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,079
differential

1211
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:23,960
so you see the the independent variables

1212
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:26,319
are under the D so uh DS DP DN so I I

1213
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,400
can

1214
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:32,240
since if so this is would be the

1215
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:35,279
differential of a function in which H is

1216
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,279
a function of s

1217
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:43,799
pnn and also the coefficients of the

1218
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:47,839
differential are the partial derivatives

1219
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:49,760
so for example the t is the partial of H

1220
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:52,440
with respect to

1221
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:56,000
S the partial of what the partial of

1222
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:58,960
this function so the partial of a

1223
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,000
function in which the enthalpy is

1224
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:07,680
expressed as a function of s p and

1225
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,680
N so that's the

1226
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,520
temperature now in the business of

1227
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,200
measuring

1228
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,520
uh

1229
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,920
properties we like to have instruments

1230
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:29,799
okay so we have a thermometer measures

1231
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:32,920
temperature bar monometer measures the

1232
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:36,319
pressure there is no energy

1233
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:39,599
meter there is no entropy

1234
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,960
meter we measure energy and entropies

1235
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,920
indirectly

1236
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:47,119
through

1237
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,400
uh temperature and

1238
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,400
pressure and

1239
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,520
volume so let's do that also

1240
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,640
mathematically so you look at this um

1241
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,039
equation here and this other equation

1242
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:06,200
then consider it as a system of two

1243
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:08,680
equations in which you want to eliminate

1244
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:11,480
the property that is hardly

1245
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:13,799
measur difficult to meas hard to measure

1246
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:16,679
which is the entropy so for example

1247
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:18,839
solve

1248
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:22,440
this

1249
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:25,000
um expression this function here as a

1250
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,719
function instead of t as a function of s

1251
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,480
write it say s is a function of

1252
01:08:27,719 --> 01:08:33,279
T and then take that s and put it in the

1253
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:38,120
original function up

1254
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:41,040
there you manage to find H as a function

1255
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:45,000
of tpn so you change the independent

1256
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:48,040
variables to ones that can be easily

1257
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,920
measured temperature and

1258
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,679
pressure so this new function and this

1259
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:55,520
is the way you have obtained it so we

1260
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:57,520
have a precise way recipe to obtain that

1261
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,719
function if we start from the

1262
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:03,000
fundamental relation

1263
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,199
is of this function you can take

1264
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,560
derivatives for example derivative of H

1265
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:10,080
with respect to

1266
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,359
T is what we call the specific heat

1267
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,880
sorry the heat

1268
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:17,480
capacity uh at constant pressure and it

1269
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,719
is a function of T and

1270
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:23,319
P so pressure and temperature we can we

1271
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,400
can measure heat capacity we can measure

1272
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:28,719
with one of these with this uh

1273
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:31,719
instrument here and so this is a fully

1274
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,719
measurable

1275
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:42,000
function a similar

1276
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:45,120
procedure we can follow to define the

1277
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,480
heat capacity at constant

1278
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,080
volume so we start again from the

1279
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,080
fundamental

1280
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:55,480
relation and notice that the temperature

1281
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,000
which is the derivative of partial

1282
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:01,040
derivative of e with respect to

1283
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,239
S is uh being a function of this

1284
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,199
variable I mean a derivative of function

1285
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:07,280
of these variables has the same

1286
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,719
independent variables so it's also a

1287
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:12,320
function of

1288
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:14,360
sbnn and also here play the game of

1289
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:19,719
eliminating

1290
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:23,320
the uh not so easy to measure property

1291
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:23,320
entropy so

1292
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,760
solve this as s s function of T and

1293
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:32,960
substitute up there to obtain that the

1294
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,400
energy a new function in which the

1295
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,120
energy is expressed in terms of the

1296
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,360
independent variables temperature and

1297
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,640
volume these

1298
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,719
are things that are easy to measure

1299
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,159
because temperature you measure with the

1300
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:46,159
uh

1301
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:52,199
thermometer volume you measure with

1302
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:55,640
the the

1303
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:57,920
stick okay so the first derivative of

1304
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:01,679
this function the partial of e with

1305
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:05,960
respect to T is

1306
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:09,199
called the uh heat capacity at constant

1307
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:11,159
volume and it is the thing that you

1308
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:14,120
measure with the other other the Jew

1309
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:18,000
apparatus at constant

1310
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,000
volume soain

1311
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,360
that but we can also do this other uh

1312
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,600
procedure to take uh okay the

1313
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,840
temperature like before here but now we

1314
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,040
make a system also with the pressure the

1315
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,640
pressure is the derivative of e with

1316
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,520
respect to

1317
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,760
V and being a derivative of a function

1318
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,159
with these independent variables it also

1319
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:44,199
has the same independent variables

1320
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:44,199
eliminate entropy also from these

1321
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:51,760
two that results in a relation between

1322
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,560
pressure volume and temperature which we

1323
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,159
call the equation of State pressure

1324
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,840
volume and temperature tempature are

1325
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:03,840
also easily measurable

1326
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:06,760
stuff that's the equation of state and

1327
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,840
the partial derivatives of this equation

1328
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:12,000
of state so the derivative of V with

1329
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,320
respect to

1330
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
T

1331
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:21,120
says how much the volume of your

1332
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,199
substance changes as as you vary the

1333
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,760
temperature as you heat it up so it's

1334
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:28,440
the

1335
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,000
a coefficient of expansion if you do it

1336
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:34,600
divided by V it's the the percentage

1337
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:39,320
increase in volume per given amount of

1338
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:42,239
given increase in temperature uh

1339
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:46,120
and uh and you can measure this when you

1340
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:48,760
do uh the experimented constant pressure

1341
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:52,280
or the second the other derivative

1342
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,280
derivative of V with respect to

1343
01:12:52,440 --> 01:13:01,239
P it says

1344
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:04,639
uh how much uh the substance get reduced

1345
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:09,400
in volume if I increase the

1346
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:12,800
pressure so the reduction is minus Delta

1347
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:18,040
V per unit of uh increasing pressure and

1348
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:21,040
again if I divide by V is the uh

1349
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,040
percentage

1350
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:28,400
uh reduction in volume

1351
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:31,159
so this when you do the experiment uh

1352
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,120
increase the pressure at at constant

1353
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:36,880
temperature this is the isothermal

1354
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:39,080
compressibility of the

1355
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,679
substance being derivatives of the

1356
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:44,080
equation of State they are function of

1357
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:47,040
TMP and these are easily measured

1358
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:50,719
because it's simply relates measuring

1359
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,719
changes in volume measuring

1360
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:59,880
temperatures so the differential of the

1361
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:01,880
equation of State done

1362
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:05,280
at fixed

1363
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:09,320
amounts uh is

1364
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,600
has these two coefficients isobaric

1365
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:16,040
expansion and isothermal compressibility

1366
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,040
appearing uh directly

1367
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:22,440
here there are other things that you can

1368
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:25,159
measure in other experiments for example

1369
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:30,520
an interesting one

1370
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:30,520
is the speed uh of sound

1371
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:39,040
propagation should be an off here

1372
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:42,400
and or the jewel Thompson coefficient in

1373
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:44,719
in the expansion of a of a gas in a

1374
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,760
throttle which occurs at constant

1375
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,440
enthalpy you measure the change in

1376
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:51,960
temperature

1377
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:55,760
over drop in pressure and it can be

1378
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:59,719
positive and negative and uh that

1379
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:01,480
allows you that is related to um the

1380
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:04,320
things the properties that we have

1381
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:08,159
already defined before

1382
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:14,679
so and also the the May relation shows

1383
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:15,880
that um CP CV Alpha p and uh Capa T are

1384
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:18,400
not

1385
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,600
independent so you don't need to measure

1386
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:24,000
all four of them you just need to

1387
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:24,000
measure three

1388
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:39,960
um let me skip that one for a moment no

1389
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,920
no it's not no I need it I need it okay

1390
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:45,560
in order to measure chemical

1391
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:49,400
potentials I do need first to show that

1392
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:54,360
chemical potentials can be written as

1393
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:54,360
functions of temperature and pressure

1394
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:02,239
so because you see uh if the chemical

1395
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:06,280
potential is defined as the partial of e

1396
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:11,320
with respect to n at constant s and

1397
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:17,000
V but that way it isn't easy to measure

1398
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:23,280
because of the S so UI is the partial of

1399
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:28,040
e with respect to n i at constant s v

1400
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,040
and all the other uh ands

1401
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,880
held well I shouldn't say that where

1402
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,120
where the where the function that I am

1403
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,199
taking the derivative of is a function

1404
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,199
of SV and all the

1405
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:43,800
ends

1406
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:47,960
however this when you view it this way

1407
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,840
it's not easy to measure because I don't

1408
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:52,280
have an energy meter and I don't have an

1409
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,280
entropy

1410
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,280
meter so the trick is to change

1411
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:02,800
variables and one way to do it is to uh

1412
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:06,480
Define a function which is called the

1413
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,400
Gibs um free

1414
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:11,560
energy uh for the moment think of it as

1415
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:17,159
just an arbitrary definition so I say

1416
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:17,159
take defined as energy minus TS plus

1417
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:22,040
PV write the

1418
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,880
differential use the differential of a

1419
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,400
fundamental relation in order to express

1420
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,840
de

1421
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:30,800
and here is what you're left

1422
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:34,800
with this expression shows that you can

1423
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:37,480
view this function G as a a function of

1424
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,360
the independent variables that appear as

1425
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,840
under the D of the differential so the

1426
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:46,960
temperature the pressure and the

1427
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:49,120
amounts so G has as say natural

1428
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,760
variables TP and

1429
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:53,760
n and from and since this is the

1430
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,840
differential of that function the

1431
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,840
chemical potential

1432
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:06,080
can therefore be written now also as a

1433
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:06,080
uh the partial of G with respect to

1434
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,040
ni and since it is a partial of G which

1435
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:14,120
is a function of T pnn it's also

1436
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:18,080
function just t

1437
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:20,679
pnn Okay so the chemical

1438
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,480
potential we would like to measure it it

1439
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:27,960
is very important to determine the

1440
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,960
properties of uh multicomponent

1441
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,639
systems but it cannot be measured

1442
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:37,560
directly there is no

1443
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:41,000
uh chemical potential

1444
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:43,400
meter however it can be measured in

1445
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,600
directly via the definition of what we

1446
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,920
call the partial pressure of a component

1447
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,840
in the

1448
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:53,360
mixture here the experimental setup is

1449
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:56,560
this I have my mixture in which I have

1450
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:59,960
many components and they are in a stable

1451
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:02,440
equilibrium State they are at some

1452
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:06,080
pressure some temperature and they have

1453
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:06,080
their chemical potentials and so

1454
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:14,760
on so what I do is to drill a hole in

1455
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,760
the wall somewhere of my

1456
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:21,920
system and substitute the wall with a

1457
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:25,360
membrane a semi oror medium or a semi-

1458
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:31,960
peral membrane where only MO ules of

1459
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:31,960
type I can cross the others

1460
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:41,320
don't

1461
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:44,960
okay so I put on the other side I I I

1462
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,560
put on the other side uh molecules of

1463
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:50,199
substance

1464
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:52,040
I and uh with the Piston I I keep them

1465
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:55,199
there and I measure the force per unit

1466
01:19:52,040 --> 01:20:00,159
area that is necessary

1467
01:19:55,199 --> 01:20:02,239
to keep them uh uh in U in mutual

1468
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:05,840
equilibrium when I reach Mutual

1469
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:11,000
equilibrium between this this little

1470
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:14,679
system I I the double script I we use as

1471
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,880
a way to to say that it is a pure

1472
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:22,120
substance so in this little

1473
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:25,520
box uh there is only substance

1474
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:28,719
I there is whereas in the mixture there

1475
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:31,480
is substance I mixed with other

1476
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:34,320
stuff okay when we are in mutal

1477
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:37,840
equilibrium cross this

1478
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,080
membrane we have proved um also the

1479
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,159
other day

1480
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:45,679
that the conditions for mutal

1481
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:45,679
equilibrium are equality of

1482
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,239
temperatures so the temperature of

1483
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:53,040
system I I must be equal to the

1484
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:54,800
temperature of the mixture and the

1485
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:59,760
quality of chemical potentials for for

1486
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,760
this for the substance that can be

1487
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:06,239
exchanged uh so the substance is I and

1488
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:07,960
so I need that the chemical potential of

1489
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,840
substance

1490
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:12,840
I of the

1491
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:16,920
mixture must be equal to the chemical

1492
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:20,800
potential of the pure substance I just

1493
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:23,800
on the other side of a semm membrane

1494
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,800
okay

1495
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:32,159
okay here I also put the uh functional

1496
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:36,360
dependence because I used what we just

1497
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:40,000
proved before that the chemical

1498
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:43,600
potential or functions can be can be

1499
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,080
written as functions of T andp and so

1500
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,320
these are the functions that we're going

1501
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,320
to use for this

1502
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:58,840
measurement okay and so

1503
01:21:54,960 --> 01:22:01,320
by looking at this equation

1504
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:06,120
which

1505
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:09,600
is required by the condition for Mutual

1506
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:15,040
equilibrium we see that uh inside the

1507
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:19,639
independent variables are all

1508
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:21,520
easily measurable things

1509
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:25,000
temperature

1510
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:28,719
pressure and also this pii

1511
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:32,280
it's the pressure of the system on the

1512
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:34,480
other side of the semi membrane we call

1513
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:37,080
that pressure the partial pressure of

1514
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,800
constituent I in the mixture it is a

1515
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,000
property of the

1516
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,600
mixture and it can be

1517
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,480
measured and by measuring it and by

1518
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,840
knowing how the chemical potential of

1519
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:52,960
the pure substance depends on so if I

1520
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,320
know this for the pure substance I can

1521
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,520
infer from that measurement

1522
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,679
the chemical potential of the

1523
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:03,760
constituent in the mixture this is how

1524
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,760
we characterize uh

1525
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,520
mixtures so here is a little summary of

1526
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:16,960
properties that we have talked about so

1527
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,960
far energy

1528
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:23,400
entropy also the volumes and the

1529
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,480
parameters that enter in the uh the

1530
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:27,360
amounts of constituents entering the

1531
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:30,040
definition of our

1532
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:32,320
system these things are these properties

1533
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:36,320
are defined for all

1534
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,320
states equilibrium and non

1535
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,880
equilibrium then we defined some other

1536
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:48,840
properties uh based on the fundamental

1537
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:51,719
relation for stable equilibrium

1538
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:53,320
States so clearly these are defined only

1539
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:55,679
if you have a fundamental

1540
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,320
relation uh so it's they're definally

1541
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,440
for stable equilibrium

1542
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:03,520
States temperature pressure chemical

1543
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:06,960
potentials the enthalpy that givs free

1544
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:10,199
energy the enthalpy because it it's it's

1545
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,560
a a e plus

1546
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:16,199
PV uh and P is the pressure pressure is

1547
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:19,199
defined only for stable equilibrium or

1548
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:23,280
the Gibs free energy as the p and the T

1549
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:26,320
also so it also is defined only for

1550
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,320
stable equilibriums

1551
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:35,159
St and then we can also we also defined

1552
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,320
the these four properties today uh the

1553
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:38,840
heat

1554
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:41,719
capacities

1555
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:45,000
the coefficient of expansion and the

1556
01:24:41,719 --> 01:24:47,760
coefficient of com uh

1557
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,159
compressibility these

1558
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:53,880
ones also are restricted for equilibrium

1559
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:56,840
States but they're even more restricted

1560
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,159
because some of those uh mathematical

1561
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:03,119
steps

1562
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:03,119
that for example if I go

1563
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:10,119
back

1564
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:13,159
here when I do this eliminating one

1565
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:18,400
variable uh I can do that

1566
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:24,719
uh only if some derivative uh is not

1567
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:24,719
equal to zero so for example uh if um

1568
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:33,080
the the partial of t with respect to S

1569
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:38,280
is equal to zero I cannot invert that

1570
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:40,560
function because it's not uh it's not

1571
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:44,360
monotonic uh

1572
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,719
and and this is what happens for example

1573
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,320
when I

1574
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:51,560
have two phase

1575
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:55,480
States like liquid and Vapor

1576
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:57,280
coexisting in that case uh

1577
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:01,159
some of these

1578
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:03,040
functions uh are not defined or which is

1579
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:06,199
the same

1580
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:09,119
uh take up infinite value infinite

1581
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:15,320
values

1582
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:15,320
okay okay so we go back to

1583
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:20,600
here

1584
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,080
now this

1585
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:27,719
also

1586
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,719
says that if we do our

1587
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,920
measurements and we can for a given

1588
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:36,320
substance or for a set of

1589
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:39,840
mixtures

1590
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:42,840
develop or measure experimentally these

1591
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,000
functions the alpha p is a function of

1592
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,320
TP and

1593
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,520
composition Capa T is a function of

1594
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,360
temperature pressure and composition the

1595
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:52,159
specific heat at constant PR I'm sorry

1596
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,639
the the heat capacity at constant

1597
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,560
pressure is a function of temperature

1598
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:57,760
pressure and comp iOS and the chemical

1599
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:00,719
potentials as a function of temperature

1600
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,880
pressure and composition if I have all

1601
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,800
these

1602
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,600
functions then with these functions I

1603
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,920
can

1604
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,800
reconstruct the fundamental relation so

1605
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,280
I know everything that I need to know

1606
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,040
about the stable equilibrium states of

1607
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,960
that

1608
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,840
substance and

1609
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:22,119
actually the Reconstruction is done

1610
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:25,760
through uh these relations here for

1611
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:25,760
example the energy

1612
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:31,800
uh this expression for the energy

1613
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,199
here can be

1614
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:38,639
related to these properties in this

1615
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:40,800
way so if I

1616
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,800
integrate from one temperature to

1617
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,560
another from one pressure to another

1618
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:49,199
this

1619
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:52,119
expression I can get variations in

1620
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:55,440
energy the entropy also is related this

1621
01:27:52,119 --> 01:27:58,000
way the enthalpy is related that

1622
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:00,520
way and

1623
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,880
uh and these are General forms that are

1624
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:06,920
valid for any pure

1625
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:12,320
substance if you also need to

1626
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:14,400
consider uh mixtures then you need to

1627
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:19,400
generalize this to use the Expressions

1628
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,400
where also the N

1629
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:26,119
appears so in this way we have uh

1630
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:35,239
uh a way to

1631
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:35,239
measure the fundamental relation of

1632
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,800
substances

1633
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:42,560
okay

1634
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,400
now

1635
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:50,400
yeah yeah we have five minutes I can do

1636
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,520
this I want to

1637
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:56,000
show that

1638
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:57,560
um some of these

1639
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,840
function like the enthalpy and the GS

1640
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,840
free

1641
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,520
energy

1642
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,920
uh are obtained

1643
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:10,960
as LeAndre

1644
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,800
transforms of the fundamental relation

1645
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,320
legan transform is a particular

1646
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:20,159
procedure

1647
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:21,920
that we can explain uh in this way with

1648
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:24,760
start with a function of a single

1649
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,920
variable

1650
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:32,719
so suppose you give me a function of a

1651
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:34,280
single variable like U uh any function

1652
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:37,480
but to

1653
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:40,679
simplify let me suppose that this

1654
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:43,920
function is a

1655
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:48,760
um either convex or concave and

1656
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:53,320
monotonic monotonic so that I can uh um

1657
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:55,840
invert and play with it okay so usually

1658
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,080
we Define a function I'll call it f of f

1659
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,080
of

1660
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:05,880
Y meaning

1661
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:08,040
that for each value of y I get the value

1662
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,040
of

1663
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:15,080
F and as I move y the function tells me

1664
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,920
how F

1665
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:22,000
moves but there is an alternative the

1666
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:24,760
idea of Leandra is that there is an

1667
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,960
alternative description

1668
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:33,600
because that function also has a tangent

1669
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:35,199
and has a line tangent to every

1670
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:40,880
Point

1671
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:44,400
okay so this tangent is

1672
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:47,400
characterized by two uh items one that

1673
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:50,920
we will call uh

1674
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:55,320
Lambda which is the angular the

1675
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:59,239
coefficient the slope of the line

1676
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:02,280
and this other value here that I we call

1677
01:30:59,239 --> 01:31:05,840
L which is The

1678
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:08,840
Intercept at y equal

1679
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,840
Z

1680
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:19,760
okay so the idea Leandra is that uh you

1681
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:23,920
can if you

1682
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:25,840
draw like it's a sketched here this

1683
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,840
slopes at every point of of the line you

1684
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:31,600
get a family of

1685
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:33,920
lines the envelope of which is your

1686
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:36,159
original

1687
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:39,920
curve

1688
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:41,560
okay each line is characterized for a

1689
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,159
given

1690
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:47,400
Lambda for a given

1691
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:51,119
Lambda by an

1692
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:54,440
L I change the point so I take another

1693
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:55,560
Lambda suppose I want some this l this

1694
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:59,679
this

1695
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:04,639
much okay so I fix Lambda so say this is

1696
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:04,639
Lambda one now I fix Lambda

1697
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:11,199
2

1698
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:14,920
and that gives me L of L of

1699
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:19,280
two so selecting

1700
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:22,639
a uh a value of

1701
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,719
Lambda specifies select the point in

1702
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:28,400
which the

1703
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:32,719
tangent as that slope of the original

1704
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:37,560
curve and therefore when you place the

1705
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:41,119
your line there it also selects an

1706
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:43,400
intercept so there is a relation between

1707
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:46,560
Lambda and

1708
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:49,880
L and that relation is the Lend

1709
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,880
transform of your

1710
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,560
function the procedure

1711
01:32:54,480 --> 01:33:01,800
is uh runs this way that you

1712
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:07,800
U you take the function you write the

1713
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:10,920
equation for the U partial for the

1714
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:13,679
derivative and

1715
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:16,360
then you define

1716
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,440
l by the geometrical construction so

1717
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:20,600
it's the function

1718
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:24,880
f

1719
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:28,080
minus this distance here

1720
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,080
okay and this distance

1721
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:38,639
here is equal to the horizontal

1722
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:43,760
segment times the slope so the tangent

1723
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:50,480
of this angle so this Lambda so L is

1724
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:50,480
equal to F minus Lambda time

1725
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:58,920
y so it corresponds to that

1726
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:01,960
description and uh I think the time is

1727
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:08,800
up for today so we'll yeah we'll pick it

1728
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:08,800
up from uh from here uh the next uh time
