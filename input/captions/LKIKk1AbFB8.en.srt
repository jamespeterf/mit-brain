1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,359
and now I am going to uh you know put

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
myself in the game here

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,040
proverbially and uh share a little bit

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,719
of of research that you know this is I

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,879
would say a mashup of of several

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,840
different research projects but the goal

7
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,359
here is to zoom out from some of uh

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,720
John's focus on Workforce challenges in

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,119
the US and then like I mentioned earlier

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
present a bridge between these Workforce

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,720
challenges and then some of the

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,480
technology and Innovation topics that

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,599
we're going to talk about in a moment

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,960
and I know a a global audience here so

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,920
feel free to uh offer questions and and

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,360
uh comments in the chat on any

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,960
disagreements or bones to pick with um

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,840
my characterization of of global

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,199
manufacturing many of you who live it

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,879
every day uh might see the data that I

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,399
present quite differently so um here we

22
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,960
go so this I want to

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,480
start by uh introducing a kind of

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,480
metaphor with manufacturing so I I think

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,199
about uh Manu ufacturing as one of the

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,320
purest forms of economic competition and

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,680
when we talk about uh tradable

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
Industries Industries where uh we're

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,560
producing value that is consumed

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,040
elsewhere that these are the industries

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
that have the biggest impact on any

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,920
Regional or even National economy these

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,640
are export driven Industries in large

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,680
part um they're they're competitive and

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
and I think the metaphor of a game in

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,240
which uh both employers but also nations

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,600
are competing with one another um to to

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,680
outdo and and essentially out earn the

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,240
other um we we need to kind of Define

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
the rules kind what is what is really

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,200
driving this competition and for a long

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,960
time the the rules of the game um

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
centered on people like Sam Seer and

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,560
this is this is Sam Seer he's from New

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
Hampshire he works at a company called

46
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,600
hypertherm um and and he's actually I

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,719
think a great Target for for a program

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,520
like John's where he previously had

49
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,520
never really seen a robot on the factory

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,960
floor a few years ago he moved into this

51
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,719
company that's investing a lot in

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,600
Automation and also investing a lot

53
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,640
internally in their training and then he

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,000
was able to get um training to to

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,160
maintain uh robots and and automated

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,319
cells and now he's a a support

57
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,000
technician earning more in that job and

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,800
and I think I think Sam is kind of a

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,640
nice backdrop for this discussion

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,879
because for a long time we thought the

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,360
game was a race to the bottom in terms

62
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,080
of of wages and labor costs that the

63
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,360
winners of the game would be the ones

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,120
that could offer mostly commodity

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,920
products Goods at the lowest price and I

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
think over time we've realized that for

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,440
some items there there might indeed be a

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,879
race to the bottom where the lowest cost

69
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,040
producer wins but that this isn't all of

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,319
the story that actually um some uh

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,720
countries and some employers can offer

72
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,519
far higher wages and offer a higher

73
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,720
quality product even if they can't

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,319
compete on price they can still um

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,400
compete and develop a profitable Factory

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,480
so race to the bottom isn't quite it in

77
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,319
in the United States given that in many

78
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,760
conts we we can't compete in the race to

79
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,879
the bottom and nor um do many American

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,799
employers want to compete we we've

81
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,519
pivoted to think about the game as

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,519
inventing the future as the goal of a

83
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,599
manufacturing economy should be to

84
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,000
support um new inventions and new

85
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,239
Innovations where the R&D side of a

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,440
business really takes the lead and the

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,360
production follows and is really in

88
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,280
support of new technology and

89
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,200
Innovations now what I think has been

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,159
challenging about this it Chris love

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,640
will talk a little bit about this in the

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,360
biospace moment is that to try to

93
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,720
separate invention from production or

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,319
try to uh I would say let's say

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,040
subjugate production in in The Pursuit

96
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,120
Of Invention this is a lot of what was

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
happening with the manufacturing

98
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,560
Innovation institutes which were focused

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,879
mostly on developing new technologies

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,879
not necessarily on improving production

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,799
techniques and and and productivity um

102
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,000
that you really see um Innovation suffer

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,400
if if productivity is there so a lot of

104
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,920
um I think really striking examples of

105
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,920
companies that tried to innovate in the

106
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,959
US and produced in China and eventually

107
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,319
they found more and more of their

108
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,400
engineering Talent going to Asia to

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
locate near production so it turns out

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,799
that I think invention and production go

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,919
more hand inand um s such that a game

112
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,120
that's really just defined by who

113
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,160
invents the most is an incomplete story

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,680
as well now what I found in in going

115
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,919
around to factories um in in the years

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,680
after covid um was this re-evaluation of

117
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,919
of that rule of inventing and uh an

118
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
understanding that in order to sustain a

119
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,840
domestic economy in order to support

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,680
needs like National Security that

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,039
countries in in many cases might need to

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,600
play their own game that they might need

123
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,240
to support their own needs even if it's

124
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,639
not cost competitive and a lot of the uh

125
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,360
market for defense Contracting and I'll

126
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,919
focus on the United States for a moment

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,840
is is motivated by that um by that where

128
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,759
where companies aren't interested in

129
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,080
competing in commercial markets and

130
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,199
instead are producing based on very

131
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,080
lucrative defense contracts and and

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,639
these companies I think are part of the

133
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,000
reason why John showed that we've

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,080
actually in the United States declined

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
in our overall productivity over the

136
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,240
last 10 years because there's a

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,440
motivation to produce something to spec

138
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,039
and often times is something very hard

139
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,560
to produce but not necessarily to

140
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,160
produce it more competitively there's

141
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
some of the same motivations in in

142
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,800
medical devices and and farm as well so

143
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,520
um so I think this playing your own game

144
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,440
is is okay to some degree but what the

145
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,319
result is is that in places like New

146
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,120
England where I live or in Ohio uh over

147
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,520
40% of uh small and medium manufacturers

148
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,160
have at least one defense contract so

149
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,880
there's a lot of Reliance on uh public

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,800
markets that are kind of insulated from

151
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,680
commercial pressures and not as much of

152
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,120
this more traditional competing to

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,639
export goods and competing to um produce

154
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,560
the the highest quality good at a

155
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,080
competitive price so what I think we've

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
seen in the past couple years and what I

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,600
want to focus on is is a a game that

158
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,600
kind of that that synthesizes some of

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,080
the um elements of each of these

160
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,479
previous three and I'm just going to try

161
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
to summarize it as as winning the

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,360
frontier and and what that means is that

163
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,840
as new technologies come about as

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,080
they're introduced so we could talk

165
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,599
about new nuclear technologies at MIT we

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,000
have a company that's trying to design a

167
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,039
new version of a a nuclear reactor um as

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,759
new Computing Technologies come out as

169
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,960
new battery technologies coming out

170
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,280
where are going to be the places that

171
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,919
are a developing the most advanced

172
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,880
versions of these Technologies and able

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,440
to produce them and that what that's

174
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,800
what I think winning the frontier means

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,759
is that you're able to produce these

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,520
Technologies and scale them up um in a

177
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,560
sort of complimentary ecosystem and and

178
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,280
I think why that's so important and why

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,000
it's not necessarily uh a global effort

180
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,160
to Wi the frontier but oftentimes a more

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,960
localized one is that we just see

182
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,759
clusters of manufacturing Excellence

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,240
happen when when it comes to different

184
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,120
products and it's very difficult to

185
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,319
maintain with maybe the exception of the

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,400
semiconductor supply chain to maintain a

187
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,759
very globally distributed uh value chain

188
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
that continues to innovate at a very

189
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,280
fast pace okay so so what does the

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,520
winning winning the frontier look like

191
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,520
what does it mean I want to give kind of

192
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,800
a recipe of what this means so I think

193
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,120
the recipe needs to start with invention

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
that that we we still care about the

195
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,840
development of new of new products of

196
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,000
new technologies and that's kind of the

197
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,080
invention outcome what are the

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,720
ingredients that go into invention you

199
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,800
know Don talked about um Talent that's

200
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,120
certainly important there's also a lot

201
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,479
of Technology development effort that

202
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,639
relies on and then there's certainly

203
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,919
risks so there's kind of the um the

204
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,800
technology Capital the risk capital and

205
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,639
then the human capital that all are

206
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,360
ingredients in this in this recipe but

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,400
as I mentioned before invention isn't

208
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,120
sufficient uh so let me just go into the

209
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,560
kind of the global Dimension here so I'm

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,199
going to focus on four different

211
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,039
countries and how they have been

212
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,159
competing in these along these different

213
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,280
ingredients one the United States um two

214
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,840
is Germany three is Japan and four is

215
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,240
China and then I'll I'll I'll show some

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,960
data on how um they've competed so I

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,280
imagine each of you have uh in the

218
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,039
audience have a sense of how these

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
different countries have competed but I

220
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,599
I'm going to um propose that that this

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,800
is the the breakdown of of competition

222
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,840
here is that when it comes to invention

223
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,720
the United States still according to

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,960
traditional data points excels at each

225
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,039
of these categories we have a lot of uh

226
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,479
risk capital in the private markets we

227
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,120
have pretty strong technology devel

228
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,440
vment coming out of um you know Advanced

229
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,599
Innovative companies as well as

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
universities we have excellent

231
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,279
engineering institutions in a um an

232
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,399
engineering Workforce and then finally

233
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,279
we're pretty darn good at at inventing

234
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,320
um new new types of Technologies as well

235
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,600
and then other leading manufacturing

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,040
markets typically excel in one or the

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,040
other of these Dimensions you see the

238
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,640
German engineering Workforce is really

239
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,600
uh excellent in terms of Technology

240
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,079
development and uh adoption Additionally

241
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,120
you see Japan in in South Korea is is

242
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,000
really excellent and then uh in terms of

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,720
risk Capital um the this the Chinese

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,560
Communist Party in the Chinese

245
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,680
government has offered a ton of risk

246
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,839
Capital to to subsidize the growth of

247
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,399
manufacturing firms um that's allowed

248
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,480
them to support some Innovative

249
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,240
Industries so a different type of risk

250
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,920
Capital but certainly um very effective

251
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,120
um in the short term so I'm I'm going to

252
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,079
start with this and I'm going to add a

253
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,000
few elements to the recipe here that I

254
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:31,160
think fill it out and get Beyond just

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
invention so if we look at at how this

256
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,440
invention story has evolved over time

257
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,320
you'll see this is just a um a plot of

258
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,200
manufacturing related patents so you

259
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
could think about patents that relate to

260
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,480
inventions that relate to the factory

261
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,839
floor if you were to expand this to

262
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,399
Computing patents or patents of of new

263
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,440
products in uh biologics the United

264
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
States the the pink line which is the US

265
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,440
would would be uh far higher but just

266
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
looking at manufacturing Investments

267
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,279
over time you see that the the US began

268
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,519
in the 1980s um as the the leader in

269
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,279
this type of invention a lot of R&D

270
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,800
Talent has begun to focus on different

271
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,079
problems but Japan and and and later

272
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,880
just in the last 10 years China have

273
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,440
really accelerated their investments in

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,760
these areas and and and I would say this

275
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,880
is turned them into um you know

276
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,040
inventive

277
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,680
powerhouses Germany um is much more on

278
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,800
par with the United States these days

279
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
despite being um significant smaller

280
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,880
economy so I think that's significant to

281
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,440
call out as well okay so now we get from

282
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,640
invention and and like I talked about

283
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,360
that inventing the future is this

284
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,240
insufficient idea we also need to think

285
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,639
about how would you produce the things

286
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,480
that you invent because there's this

287
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,360
positive feedback loop between inventing

288
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,320
um new Goods producing them learning

289
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
from production and then improving the

290
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,120
inventions and and what we see in in the

291
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,079
production numbers is really that the

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,320
United States over the last uh 45 years

293
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,839
has has depleted its production capacity

294
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,920
that no longer um Can it

295
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,639
produce um you know produce at the level

296
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,680
of other countries and a lot of the the

297
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,600
challenge is not just that uh there

298
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,000
aren't uh incredibly productive and

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,200
effective American factories there still

300
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,360
are but because American manufacturing

301
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,279
has been in Decline it's had difficulty

302
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,360
recruiting new workers it's had

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:20,200
difficulty um encouraging you know um

304
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,440
recruiting New Capital to subsidize risk

305
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,040
um in production not necessarily in

306
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,160
invention so that it's fallen behind

307
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,320
these other countries so so what do I

308
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,880
mean by that in in practice here's just

309
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,040
a a plot and ites doesn't come up to the

310
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,720
present I can explain a little bit why

311
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,880
on how uh you know we get missing data

312
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
after the Trump Administration um but

313
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,880
this is looking at manufacturing exports

314
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,240
and what I think the story is here is

315
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,440
that we have really three equilibria of

316
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,959
manufacturing economies um that are

317
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
exporting to the rest of the world one

318
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,279
equil one equilibrium is kind of uh I

319
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,040
would say Korea Taiwan and China which

320
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,680
are heavy exporters we don't have

321
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,360
Chinese data here but exporting at

322
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,519
upwards of 20% of their GDP are come

323
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
from manufacturing exports so these are

324
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,600
very much manufacturing driven economies

325
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,120
where production you know is is

326
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,160
dominating the market the the second

327
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,000
excuse me there um you know the second

328
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,600
equilibrium it comes from comp countries

329
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,360
like uh you know Germany um in in some

330
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,920
cases you know Mexico even though the

331
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,600
Mexican manufacturing economy has been

332
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,480
hit pretty hard over the last uh over

333
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,760
the last decade but but really we could

334
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,680
think about that as Germany and Japan um

335
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,120
being in this this lower equilibrium

336
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,519
still significant chunk of the

337
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,440
manufacturing economy about 20% of GDP

338
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,600
in Germany comes from manufacturing um

339
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,680
and that's been stable even as precious

340
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,680
for the industrialization have come in

341
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,920
um and that would I would say is a

342
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,639
middle tier um equilibrium manufacturing

343
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,160
is still very important but it's it's a

344
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,839
diversified economy and then finally at

345
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,519
at the lower level where only you know

346
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,199
less than 5% of GDP come from

347
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,800
manufacturing exports and only about 10%

348
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,440
of of overall employment comes from

349
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,240
manufacturing is is the United States um

350
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,680
and it's it's on par with with France

351
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,320
which has suffered from similar

352
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,639
de-industrialization so so what does

353
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,279
that mean for the us to have

354
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,160
manufacturing as more of a marginal play

355
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,920
more of a marginal role in the economy

356
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,360
it's that while there are all sorts of

357
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,240
res economic resources focused on on

358
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,920
invention of new technologies there

359
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,800
aren't the same resources focused on how

360
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,199
to produce them well so you get this

361
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,839
Detachment between invention and

362
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,680
production which I imagine many of you

363
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,800
are are very familiar with so so why

364
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,160
this kind of long-winded context is

365
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,639
because part of the the Trends today of

366
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,480
bringing invention back closer to

367
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,800
production depend on the you know the

368
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,920
bending of the curve for the United

369
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,639
States and the United States to play

370
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,880
catchup which is what I'll I'll focus on

371
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,440
a bit in a moment um okay so what are

372
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,360
the ingredients for for doing production

373
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,600
well that are that are different and and

374
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,800
what are kind of missing in the United

375
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,920
States but present in other countries so

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,639
there's mechanical Talent on on the left

377
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,720
which John uh Lou is talking about where

378
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,240
um the US manufacturing Workforce and

379
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,560
and the the production Workforce in

380
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,800
particular um has just you know uh the

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,079
investment in that Workforce has

382
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,560
declined dramatically the second is is

383
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
technology adoption which is actually

384
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,880
related to Mechanical Talent the more

385
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,240
talent you have on the factory floor the

386
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,320
better able you are to adopt new

387
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,399
technology so you see in John's numbers

388
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,320
and I'll show you more numbers in a

389
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,639
moment that technology adoption in other

390
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,160
countries has accelerated um and and

391
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,079
reached far higher levels than in the

392
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,320
United States where only um you know 12%

393
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,399
of uh of us manufacturers have any

394
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,399
robotic automation at all less than a

395
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,240
third in many cases have soft any type

396
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,000
of advanced software on the factory

397
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,880
floor and then finally I I want to talk

398
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,079
a little bit about Capital markets so we

399
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,279
have um a lot of investment in

400
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,720
traditional risk Capital supporting new

401
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
higher growth businesses that are

402
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
focused on invention in the United

403
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,680
States but we don't have Capital to

404
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,120
support operational risks for example so

405
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,639
any asset intensive investment in

406
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,240
manufacturing the United States isn't

407
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,560
hasn't been supported in public public

408
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,040
markets um really since the 1980s which

409
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,399
which marked kind of the transition to

410
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,839
focus on asset light companies and

411
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,279
supporting um you know companies that

412
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,839
might have a small manufacturing

413
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,399
footprint in the United States but

414
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,240
really are just system integrators and

415
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,480
relying on on the real production the

416
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,519
industrial base coming from abroad and

417
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,000
that that shift in um your support for

418
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,639
operational risk um essentially

419
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,560
disinvestment in operational risk I

420
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,519
think limited what manufacturers could

421
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
do even if they wanted to uh produce

422
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,560
things Dom ially so that's a missing

423
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,040
piece in in US manufacturing currently

424
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,800
and just to give you some data points on

425
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,720
this um one is you John showed you the

426
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,560
Manu robot adoption as a as a proportion

427
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,759
of overall manufacturing I want to show

428
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,199
you just robot adoption overall and over

429
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,480
time to show that in in China um largely

430
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
subsidized by the central government

431
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,440
robot adoption has has grown pretty

432
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,720
dramatically you've seen some growth um

433
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,079
in in Japan as well but in the United

434
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
States has actually been been pretty

435
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,800
flat over the over the last 10 years and

436
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,160
at a pretty low level as a share of the

437
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,240
manufacturing economy um okay so finally

438
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,480
I think one of the missing pieces and

439
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,639
one of the things that even in uh places

440
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
like the Department of Defense they

441
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,680
don't like to really you know consider

442
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,839
and talk about is the industrial Base by

443
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,480
which I mean real commodity production

444
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,480
of components that everyone relies on

445
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,440
but no one really thinks are um you know

446
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,160
are you know High added value no one

447
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,040
really wants to produce in um High wage

448
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,800
markets and I I think it's it's

449
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,279
important not to ignore that the

450
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,680
industrial base has really Consolidated

451
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,279
in um in one place uh particularly for

452
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,720
Advanced Technologies still that rely on

453
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,600
commodity components those components

454
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
are primarily um coming from China and

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,560
and there hasn't been much

456
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,319
diversification Beyond maybe Taiwan

457
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,000
taking some of that market share okay so

458
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,800
I I'm then going to shift from this kind

459
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,480
of uh very broad overview of uh kind of

460
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,079
the global manufacturing Dynamic of just

461
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,919
four countries to look at what went

462
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,280
wrong in in the US context

463
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,880
so the United States if if we look at

464
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,079
this kind of breakdown the United States

465
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,079
actually used to be in in the late 1800s

466
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,760
and early 1900s um very good at

467
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,959
operational Risk Technology adoption and

468
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,959
mechanical talent and you can see in

469
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,919
this plot that between about 1950 and

470
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,319
1980 you have all of these indicators of

471
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,280
manufacturing performance investments in

472
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,600
new technology the red line um

473
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,880
employment the yellow line productivity

474
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,360
value added wages all going up and to

475
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,320
the right it's a very positive

476
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,840
equilibrium and then in the 1980s some

477
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,840
something happens that that's pretty

478
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,799
dramatic this is the onset of

479
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,240
competition from Japan and really a

480
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,039
conscious effort at the federal

481
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,960
government level frankly to disinvest

482
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,000
from manufacturing and shift Capital to

483
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,679
other sectors and in sectors that are

484
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,960
more focused on invention and less on

485
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,320
production a you know uh essentially

486
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,919
pulling capital and in the the failure

487
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,120
of of companies in the public markets

488
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:06,159
that were more asset intensive um and

489
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,360
then in the 2000s really a move a pretty

490
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,159
intensive mood to toward globalization

491
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,520
and and the consequence that I think is

492
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,559
is easy to ignore is that not only was

493
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,720
this a reduction in employment and a

494
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,200
flattening of wages which you might

495
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,039
think you know the flattening of wages

496
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,039
is because of pressures to race to the

497
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,799
bottom but it's also a flattening of

498
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,880
investment in new technology of taking

499
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,120
those operational risks so the red line

500
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,200
there's this blip with the early in

501
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,080
about 1998 with early investments in

502
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,559
computers but then since since that time

503
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,120
uh investments in new technology have

504
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,280
been pretty flat just like we see with

505
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,120
robot adoption numbers so this is not

506
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,880
really recipe to to compete or to to win

507
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,080
the frontier in both invention and

508
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,480
production and and how I've begun to

509
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,280
think about this is that one of the

510
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,360
consequences of of this disinvestment

511
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,120
over the last 40 years is that we have a

512
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,960
Lost Generation of manufacturing

513
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,280
innovators and Manufacturing workers so

514
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
here's just a plot of the age

515
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,039
distribution

516
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,159
in manufacturing um in you know the last

517
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,480
couple years is the blue distribution

518
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,440
and then in 2000 is the the red

519
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,520
distribution now the red distribution

520
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,039
where the majority of workers are in

521
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,320
their uh 30s and 40s and then you have

522
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,080
kind of equal tails on either side

523
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,840
that's a pretty normal distribution for

524
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,240
for any industry but the blue

525
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,240
distribution is is abnormal you know in

526
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,960
a problem where you have the um the the

527
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,440
highest frequency of workers in their

528
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,280
60s and in some cases their 70s

529
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,240
um and you have this huge gap of workers

530
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,000
in their 30s and 40s and then you you've

531
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,520
seen manufacturers try to catch up with

532
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,840
this bump of workers in their um in more

533
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,919
entry-level positions so this is this is

534
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,120
a gap not just um because of the

535
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,320
impending retirements of the the the

536
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,520
bulk of manufacturing workers but it's

537
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,240
also a gap in in knowledge and talent

538
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
that you think about a lot of the Future

539
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,840
Leaders of manufacturing should be in

540
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,159
that middle but there there was really a

541
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,320
Lost Generation of manufacturing workers

542
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,960
you know this is also reflected in in

543
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,960
wages I think John referenced some of

544
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,799
this but um the idea that the

545
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,679
manufacturing worker used to make 40%

546
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,799
more in manufacturing than they could in

547
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,880
other sectors and today they only make

548
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,679
about 2% more so the there used to be

549
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,159
this big wage premium manufacturing that

550
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,120
was attracting droves and droves of

551
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,440
workers no longer is that the case and

552
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,960
then finally I I think I want to Pivot

553
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,799
to some more encouraging news that in

554
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,679
manufacturing this isn't a general story

555
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,559
I imagine some of you in the audience

556
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,440
who are in certain industries being yeah

557
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,640
like hey I I see this data but this

558
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,400
isn't my experience with manufacturing

559
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,159
my manufacturing is much higher wage for

560
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,559
example we have much advanced technology

561
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,960
we're thinking about introducing um we

562
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,039
have lots of robots we're thinking about

563
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,280
introducing an AI layer on top of maybe

564
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,960
the software that you use to interact

565
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,320
with the robots I think that's great and

566
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,520
I what I want to recognize is that there

567
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,280
is a lot of variation even within us

568
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,080
manufacturing so if I break it down um

569
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,640
in this kind of you know Cardiac Arrest

570
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,360
chart here you'll see that and I'm

571
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,520
plotting productivity on the left panel

572
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,799
and wages on the right panel a what I

573
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,480
want you to note is that there's a

574
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,039
relationship between an industry's

575
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,320
productivity as wages as you might

576
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,880
expect and B to note how high the

577
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,640
variation is um in terms of value added

578
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,080
employee by manufacturing industry right

579
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,279
so that the top industries are 3x more

580
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,600
productive than the bottom Industries

581
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,159
and pay more than double the bottom

582
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,159
Industries right so this is a huge

583
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,039
spread in terms of the variation in

584
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,880
productivity of these industries part of

585
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,440
that is just industry Dynamics and and

586
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,080
how they compete but part of it is

587
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,640
investments in technology so if you look

588
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,279
at chemicals and steel there's been real

589
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,559
transformation and also just you know

590
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,600
differences in volume and and the

591
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,760
character of production in these

592
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,200
industries but that translates in into

593
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,320
wages um and in some cases into to

594
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,559
Global

595
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,840
competitiveness so what I want to um do

596
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,440
and I think this transitions to to Bruce

597
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,840
because uh I think Bruce's efforts in

598
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
Industry take off from um some of these

599
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,039
inspirations

600
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,480
is that we've seen beginning a little

601
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:08,279
bit uh before 2020 but really taking off

602
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,240
since 2020 a shift in how entrepreneurs

603
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,760
and investors have begun to think about

604
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,679
manufacturing and I think there have

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,039
been two Inspirations that have allowed

606
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,159
um American uh manufacturing operators

607
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,919
in particular to see new possibilities

608
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,120
of how uh they can compete in a a very

609
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,200
competitive Global manufacturing

610
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,679
environment on the left you know I think

611
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,960
SpaceX um and and to to some extent and

612
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,960
Tesla have been real Pioneers uh not

613
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,559
always successful in their manufacturing

614
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,080
efforts but certainly Pioneers in

615
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,559
showing that taking big risks in

616
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,600
adopting new approaches to manufacturing

617
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,080
can pay off and and can pay off and

618
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,559
actually really high wage markets in the

619
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:51,240
United States so to to hire intensively

620
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,880
um in in places like California um has I

621
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,320
think changed the calculation for others

622
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,120
that have looked at well if if Tesla's

623
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,200
able to do that or SpaceX is able to do

624
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,080
that we must be able to to um adopt

625
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,799
experiments in a similar way or adopt

626
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,880
new approaches to manufacturing that

627
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,960
would allow us to compete in our

628
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,240
industry so we've seen this um not only

629
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,600
from the uh from folks who have worked

630
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,919
at SpaceX or Tesla and left to start

631
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,880
their own companies so now there are

632
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,840
kind of these these cousin companies of

633
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,279
SpaceX and Tesla that have been inspired

634
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,480
by their more experimental approach to

635
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,640
production but also um for example the

636
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,840
the automotive companies that are

637
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,880
competitors to Tesla starting to adopt

638
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,200
some of their approaches to using uh

639
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,080
software as kind of a key approach not

640
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,240
just to you know software in the vehicle

641
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,400
but also software as a um you know a key

642
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,360
component of the manufacturing process

643
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,919
and that that software and and good data

644
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
science should be a a central part of

645
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,960
the factory floor so I think that these

646
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,520
these models um of start more startup

647
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,960
companies that are inspired by high

648
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,760
growth software startups um are now

649
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,400
we're seeing more of this in uh

650
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,559
manufacturing companies more traditional

651
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,840
sectors then the second model that I

652
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,600
think is is really interesting but takes

653
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,240
a more you know traditional

654
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,600
manufacturing approach that includes

655
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,080
statistical process control you know

656
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,279
Theory constraints is Amazon that Amazon

657
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,520
has experienced you extraordinary scale

658
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,039
up and extraordinary growth um using

659
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,400
many manufacturing principles and

660
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,120
applying them to Logistics and

661
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,000
warehousing um in their fulfillment

662
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,840
centers so uh in in transitioning to

663
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,200
Bruce I think you know Bruce's Uh

664
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,919
current efforts in Industry which I

665
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,120
think he might talk about a little bit

666
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,919
are um partly inspired by applying these

667
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,559
princi so Jeff Wilkey who was formerly

668
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,520
CEO of Amazon um consumer um was a

669
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,760
co-founder of rebuild manufacturing

670
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,520
which Bruce is a part of um and it's all

671
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,360
you MIT uh leaders for manufacturing

672
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,760
alumni who come now from various

673
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,039
experiences over the last 30 years and

674
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,200
are applying these experiences to

675
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,559
traditional manufacturing Industries as

676
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,760
part of the industrial base so I think

677
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,640
there's a lot of exciting potential and

678
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,600
um skill and scaleup that that are being

679
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,679
used um there and and at other companies

680
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,240
um that have taken the Amazon

681
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,640
inspiration as well so um the final

682
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,679
thing and I know that we have a global

683
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,960
audience here so to Pivot back to the

684
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,520
global Dimension a bit is to think about

685
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,960
what uh American manufacturers are

686
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,039
learning from foreign companies so I

687
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,480
mentioned in the conversation with John

688
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,320
the the RO of BMW is I think a real uh

689
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,720
Pioneer in American manufacturing over

690
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,159
the last 30 years it's actually the

691
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,360
largest American exporter right now is

692
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,720
is BMW South Carolina facility um so and

693
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,159
it's not alone it's representative of

694
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,399
this much larger Trend so if you look at

695
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
this plot we recently uh published a

696
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,720
couple papers on the role of FDI in

697
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,760
reshaping the foreign direct investment

698
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,840
reshaping us manufacturing and you can

699
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,279
see that foreign direct investment has

700
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,120
more than doubled in the last um in the

701
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,520
last several decades whereas overall

702
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,120
capital investment us manufacturing has

703
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,880
been relatively flat so foreign firms

704
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,279
foreign owned firms have taken a larger

705
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,919
and larger share of of us Manufacturing

706
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:01,640
investment you know the motivations are

707
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,240
are multiple part of it's access to

708
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,440
Talent part of it's access to a consumer

709
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,559
Market why there's so much FDI but I

710
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,080
think aside from those motivations one

711
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,840
of the key uh takeaways that we have

712
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,360
looking at the data is that these

713
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,720
foreign owned firms are more like

714
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,320
they're more productive than their

715
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,600
American counterparts they're more

716
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,240
Capital intensive and they pay higher

717
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,880
wages so they're really raising the bar

718
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,320
in in manufacturing in a lot of

719
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,279
Dimensions um and and I think one of the

720
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,000
open questions is are American firms

721
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,840
going to learn sufficiently from their

722
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,159
new foreign own neighbors such that

723
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,039
they'll be able to reap benefits from

724
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,039
knowledge spillovers and really um grow

725
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,600
based on the you know the positive

726
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,720
inputs from companies that have uh kind

727
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,520
of that started elsewhere so so this I

728
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,760
think is an interesting Trend to follow

729
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,520
some of you might have experiences i'

730
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,880
love to hear your input in in the chat

731
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,600
um and and one that that I think we're

732
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,919
um going to continue to to look into so

733
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,240
with that I'm going to

734
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,480
um look to see if there are any question

735
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,279
questions I can't currently see any of

736
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,760
the questions if anyone wants to help me

737
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:07,880
out um in case anyone had any responses

738
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,880
the

739
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,799
presentation Steve did you see any

740
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,399
questions in the

741
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,480
chat oh I see two

742
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:20,440
now okay so uh I'll just read the

743
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,799
question for everyone do you think the

744
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,159
decline in US manufacturing begin to

745
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,320
shift upwards is the Federal grant

746
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,960
funding requirements for us

747
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,360
manufacturing me to take effect the

748
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,840
Technologies developed in University

749
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,080
Labs with Federal grant funding are

750
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,840
commercialized um so I I'll I'll take

751
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,240
this question a little bit broader is is

752
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,080
kind of is US industrial policy working

753
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,880
and I should note that us industrial

754
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,399
policy is playing catchup with uh

755
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,200
longstanding industrial policies in

756
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,840
other countries that have been very

757
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,519
successful at stimulating new Industries

758
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,600
um and I think there there's been a lot

759
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,320
written about Japan and Korea and and

760
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,880
those industrial policies as models for

761
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,720
other countries a lot of Latin American

762
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,880
countries have tried to look learn from

763
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,519
the Japanese and Korean models but the

764
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,360
question of us industrial policy right

765
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,519
now is that there are certainly

766
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,200
short-term benefits that we're seeing so

767
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,960
there's been I think 170% increase in

768
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
new Factory investment so it's pretty

769
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,640
clear given the the current state of

770
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,360
factories that are are half half built

771
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,720
that there's going to be a spike in US

772
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,679
manufacturing employment and US

773
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,840
manufacturing capacity um by 2030 right

774
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,279
that's that's pretty clear given where

775
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,640
new Greenfield facilities are um the

776
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,120
question is

777
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,880
um and I think this is a question that's

778
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,000
interesting to John and and me and

779
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,320
others is that you know will those

780
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,880
factories operate any differently than

781
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,480
other factories over the last 20 years

782
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,519
will they continue to decline in their

783
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,440
overall productivity or will they really

784
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,399
learn lessons from their peers abroad

785
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,960
learn lessons from higher growth uh

786
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,080
factories and the like so so I think

787
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,799
that's the the the open question but

788
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,720
there's certainly going to be a

789
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,559
shortterm kind of Sugar High um from

790
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,279
industrial policy incentives the second

791
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,640
uh the conductor upwards trend is do

792
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,320
more reflection of the shortage due to

793
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,559
covid or more steady rise in the

794
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,440
productivity of this industry um I mean

795
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:11,519
I think there are a few motivators for

796
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,679
um investments in semiconductors in the

797
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,320
US I think one is the kind of fragile

798
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,559
geopolitical nature of where Advanced

799
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,919
node semiconductors are currently

800
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,919
produced you know namely Taiwan um and I

801
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,159
think there was also a pretty Stark

802
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:26,880
recognition during covid motivated some

803
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,760
by the automakers but some just in

804
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,799
general um

805
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,840
by uh you know um you know consumer

806
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,279
electronics that the the semiconductor

807
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,760
supply chain that used to be really

808
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,240
strong in the US was just totally

809
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,159
atrophied and that we had you know

810
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,320
design capabilities in the US and still

811
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,039
in many ways are are highly competitive

812
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,240
in design but we don't really produce uh

813
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,440
equipment we don't have um you know

814
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,399
testing and uh assembly capabilities and

815
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,600
our Fabs are are falling way behind we

816
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
don't Pro we you know in as of you know

817
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,559
2021 2022 we didn't really have any

818
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,039
advanced node capacity in the US at all

819
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,159
so I think there was a w certainly a

820
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,320
wakeup call around 2020 but the the lack

821
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,360
of capacity um had been a problem for a

822
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,519
long time and really and I I I talked to

823
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,720
the people in semiconductor industry

824
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,039
about this that a lot of people in the

825
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,240
semiconductor industry didn't think this

826
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,120
is a problem right they're totally okay

827
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,960
with the global nature of the

828
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,679
semiconductor value chain like it's okay

829
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,039
that asml is producing things C certain

830
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,919
you know their their products in the

831
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,159
asml in Europe and we have um tsmc in

832
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,880
Asia and we have kind of analog in the

833
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,600
US you know that that's all fine um and

834
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,559
they didn't see a real problem with it

835
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,360
whereas now the US I think driven by

836
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,840
mostly National Security concerns is

837
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,159
saying well that is a problem and we

838
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,200
want to have more capacity domestically

839
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,440
um I'm going to go to the last two and

840
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,240
then I see Bruce so then I'm going to

841
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,360
introduce you Bruce um what

842
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,120
opportunities do you see for technical

843
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,559
leadership and Manufacturing to connect

844
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,799
with manufacturing leaders um to get

845
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,440
involved with these programs well I

846
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,440
think it's going to depend on the case

847
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,120
you know I in some cases what we might

848
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,639
do well and this is I think a broader

849
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,600
question of how might companies that are

850
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:08,200
that do manufacturing engage with folks

851
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,480
who work on an MIT you know what we do

852
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,799
with some companies is we'll just have a

853
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,039
group from the company visit and we'll

854
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,320
bring in relevant uh researchers or

855
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,120
teachers and we'll do workshops with the

856
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,039
company based on their challenges we're

857
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,600
going to do one of those um uh in in a

858
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,480
few weeks with with a large

859
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,039
multinational and and those I think can

860
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,960
be really fun and and we learn a lot

861
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,840
from from companies and and that's how

862
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,840
you know that fuels our research um and

863
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,720
hopefully companies find that valuable

864
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,039
um the another path is if companies have

865
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,639
particular either technical questions or

866
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,399
or research questions that they don't

867
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:42,320
quite have people on their R&D team to

868
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:43,919
pursue um that there are there are teams

869
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,279
that that work on those sponsored

870
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,039
projects here where you could sponsor an

871
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,399
MIT graduate student or postto for

872
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,720
example to take on that technical

873
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:52,360
challenge they'd have to be able to

874
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,440
publish it as part of their research but

875
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,519
it also could be beneficial for industry

876
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,519
so we've had various of those

877
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,960
Partnerships in the past as well um

878
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,600
final question how can American

879
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,120
manufacturers handle High labor costs

880
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,320
can we only manufacture expensive

881
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,679
products great question so that that I

882
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,720
think was the big point about this this

883
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,000
idea that race to the bottom you know

884
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,200
doesn't really work and it's not really

885
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,799
the game that we're playing anymore um

886
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,240
I'll give you you know the initial

887
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,399
picture I had of samser at at hyperm I

888
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,639
think is a good example so hypertherm is

889
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,639
in new rural New Hampshire they try to

890
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:28,559
hire uh you know they they they have a

891
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:30,760
tough time hiring because it's a rural

892
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,080
you know relatively sparse Community uh

893
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,639
they pay really well they pay their

894
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,360
workers well above they're still a

895
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:37,159
manufacturing premium at hypertherm it's

896
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,799
an employee owned company so they do

897
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,519
profit sharing with their employees so

898
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,399
this is like distinctly High wage

899
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,880
they're not trying to compete on wages

900
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,679
and what what they've done is just and

901
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,519
they still are competing with um cutting

902
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,399
tool manufacturers from China right so

903
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,919
they're Mach Machine Tool manufacturer

904
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:56,399
and they compete on quality and price um

905
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,399
but really where where they're bread and

906
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,159
butter is is productivity so they say

907
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,840
yeah our our workers might make 4X 5x

908
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,399
what our competitors's workers might

909
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,159
make but we're also we're going to try

910
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,480
to be 8 9x more productive and that I

911
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,720
think is is the recipe to competing on

912
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,320
um to competing with high costs and

913
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,120
particular High Cost of Labor and I

914
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,279
think of uh some of Bruce's colleagues

915
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,519
who are producing commodity Parts like

916
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,440
um you know bicycle composite bicycle

917
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,720
wheels or backpack frames less

918
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,480
expensively than their Chinese

919
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,639
counterparts and and with with higher

920
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,639
quality so it can be done even in high

921
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,120
wage markets like Colorado as well so I

922
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:36,760
think that's those cases are really

923
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,559
exciting now I think what many of you

924
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,639
probably gathered from the data is that

925
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,720
those cases in the US are are an extreme

926
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:45,000
minority they're they're the exceptions

927
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,159
rather than the rule and I think you

928
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,279
know the the other exciting piece is

929
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,399
that the exceptions in the US where

930
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,159
high- wage manufacturers Thrive look

931
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,440
differently than how German High wage

932
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,600
manufacturers Thrive so it's like

933
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,480
they're playing the same game but

934
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,760
they're using a different Playbook which

935
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
which I find very interesting and I

936
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,039
think that we have a lot to learn from

937
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,679
uh from one another so I'm going to pass

938
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,000
it over to um to Bruce but would love to

939
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,320
talk with anyone else um about this if

940
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,720
you're interested uh my email is

941
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,240
