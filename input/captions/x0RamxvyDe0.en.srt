1
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,600
All right. Well, let's just talk about

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,600
games a little bit. Um, so your learning

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,119
journal assignment was, uh, what are

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,519
the, um, what are the learning games

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,199
that you all played in your in your

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,199
youth or your contemporary times? We

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
heard Omar has talked with us a couple

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,360
of times about his passion for typing

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,719
games um and the importance of them in

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,280
his middle school experience, but what

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,680
other kinds of games um are memorable to

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,120
folks in their growing up for learning

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,360
or otherwise? Yeah, Emily. I think like

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
there was this game like game 24 or

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,840
something. It was like you'll have math

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,079
24. Oh, math 24. Man. Yeah. You have

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,399
like four numbers on a card and then

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,719
you're supposed to add, subtract,

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,960
multiply, divide, however you want to

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,559
get to the number 24. Did you do it

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,440
online or in the cards? No, in the

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,640
cards. Yeah, I was in elementary school.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
All right. Cool. This is it? No, we

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,040
don't know. I don't know. I used the

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,840
Yeah, those cards card game version. Oh,

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
all right. Spinning these things around.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,240
Cool. Other And where did this show up

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,640
in elementary class? Yeah, it was like

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
they put it in like the indoor recess

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,080
spot.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,439
That's great. That's great. Um, what

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
else? What other kinds of games did

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,400
people play?

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
Sabrina, what was your None of these

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
counts as like like really really

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,799
educational, but um I used to play a lot

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,799
of cool math games as a kid.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,600
They kind of are. At first they were and

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,799
god is straight up just I teach you time

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,799
management with all my

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,119
they teach you alt tab on your computer

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,759
once a teacher walks behind your monitor

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,860
is is Fruit Ninja a math game. Oh my

44
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,560
god. They also teach you like teamwork.

45
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,920
[Laughter]

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,720
Um, yeah, there is a pretty funny just

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,599
naming convention of like, let's call it

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
cool math games and then like maybe

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
parents won't notice. I mean, there's

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,239
definitely a first glance of like, oh,

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
you're playing cool math games. That's

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
probably fine. They're like, no, those

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
are not math games. Categories at the

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,280
top.

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah, categories. Numbers. Yeah,

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,440
platformer.

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,319
Um, block removal. Yeah, it's a it's I

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,239
don't know. There definitely some

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,800
darts. Test your aim in an online

60
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
multiplier. Okay. Idle breakout. Maybe

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
there used to be like those

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
multiplication like penguin race games

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
and you have to like answer the

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,800
multiplication questions as fast as you

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,680
could. Yep. Um definitely

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
definitely a uh Oh, Math Playground.

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,239
Yeah, that is another one that I've

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,120
seen. Um no, this this I think is a

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:06,000
direct descendant of Math Blaster.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,200
Um, uh, play now.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,440
Play now.

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,440
Playing against Luke and Shamar. Are

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,879
Luke and Shamar real? We don't know.

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,560
Let's just see how close this is to

75
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,040
math. Yeah, this is this is exactly Math

76
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Blaster.

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,280
Um, and we'll play a little Math Blaster

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,800
later. Good.

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Yeah, good job everyone. nice strong

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,159
strong singledigit multiplication skills

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,920
in the MIT students. I'm very proud of

82
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:39,840
you. Other other things I was saying um

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,959
like in my other class, my learning

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,239
class, we're like really pushing the

85
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
boundary of what's considered like a

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
learning game. Um and like one I grew up

87
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
playing a lot of board games with my

88
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,680
family. Um and one that like I'm right

89
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
now doing a project on that like makes

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
me really realize all the skills that I

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,879
learned was a board game called The

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
Resistance. You never heard of it? Um

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,760
and like was just thinking about like

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,599
skills that I've learned from that of

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
like not like how to keep a poker face,

96
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,680
but like how to formulate an argument to

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,480
like back up the claims that I've made.

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Um, and like how to just like have

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,959
constructive arguments about with

100
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
between people. So like a lot of

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,560
communication skills and just like life

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,920
skills that I use to this day that were

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,479
still just like developed in some of

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,280
those like almost like roleplaying

105
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,440
communication games. Have any of you

106
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,759
ever played Mafia or Werewolf? That's a

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,160
derivation of Mafia or Werewolf. Um, the

108
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,600
guy who invented rare where there is a

109
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,919
guy who invented mafia. Um, it's not

110
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
just like an like a sort of cultural

111
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,919
it's not it's not like a century old

112
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,240
game. It's a guy who now I think lives

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,160
in Newton or Welsley. He applied for a

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,919
job in my lab once. He's a Russian

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
immigrant. Um, he grew up in Russia and

116
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
then came here. But I'm like he was

117
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,560
like, "Yeah, I invented Mafia." And I

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
was like, "I played that at camp when I

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,479
was a kid." Like, nope. We, you know, it

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,680
came from a particular moment and things

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,919
like that. It's kind of cool.

122
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Um uh that's definitely a topic I want

123
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,680
us to talk about uh today and is

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,800
featured in the book this idea of

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
transfer. Um what is it that you learned

126
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
playing the resistance that we might

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
plausibly think you would you would

128
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
actually be able to deploy in other

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,960
non-similar contexts and what does

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,360
research tell us about uh about that and

131
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,160
which which ends up being a sort of

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,400
crucial question that the utility and

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
value of learning games hinges around.

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Um, if you can get better at lots of

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,479
things by playing Minecraft, if you can

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,759
get better at critical thinking, if you

137
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
can get better at teamwork, if you can

138
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
get better at socialization, then like,

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
oh, Minecraft sounds pretty cool. If

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,759
actually playing a lot of Minecraft just

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,160
makes you better at Minecraft, um, then

142
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,840
the then the social utility of Minecraft

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
playing in, you know, in schools or for

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
learning experience goes down quite a

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
bit. Um, what other games have people

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,680
played or other things? What was yours,

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,759
Khalil? Uh, so I generalize both. So

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,080
there's a lot of games that rely on

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,759
coordinate systems as an integral part

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,759
of the game and a lot of these like you

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,440
could easily draw the parallels of it

152
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,919
towards like massification with

153
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,639
regarding to that. The game that the

154
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,759
most closely resemble that I remember is

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,039
game over golfer to just like a car

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:19,080
zombie like uh plant versus zombie like

157
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,919
game. Uhhuh. Uh but it relies on you

158
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,680
placing like it tells you hey place this

159
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,479
at this coordinate and you have to

160
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
figure out that quickly. So it have to

161
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,960
like internalize the idea of the

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,880
coordinate system beyond just like a

163
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,160
search slow search because that would

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,759
just get you so far.

165
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Uhhuh. How quickly will you will see the

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,160
basics of this?

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,240
No plot. No plot.

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,199
Oh, I see. All

169
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,160
right.

170
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,919
Cool. Um, the coordinate. Oh, and now I

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,479
turn the sound off on that. The Let's

172
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:37,080
see if this Let's see if we can find his

173
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,080
Apple trick. Um,

174
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,840
uh, Apple Trek. Yeah. Originally

175
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,400
released in 1971.

176
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,360
Um, also had, uh, I was just going to

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,720
let us get into it.

178
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Um, this was the game that I played when

179
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,039
I was a kid that had a sort of

180
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,360
coordinate system in it. Um, where, uh,

181
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,199
you just had to shoot photon torpedoes

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,240
at uh, bad guys. You could press F. F

183
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
will

184
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,319
Thank you. Um, yeah. Good. Yeah. Yeah.

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
So, you have to sort of fly through,

186
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
you're sort of flying through the

187
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,039
universe and eventually if you want to

188
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,039
shoot the photon torpedo, you have to

189
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,400
um, you know, figure out what the angle

190
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,759
is and um, you know, you know, fire it

191
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,039
at 90 degrees or 70 degrees or um, other

192
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
kinds of things like that. Wasn't very

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,960
good gameplay video, but uh, but it's

194
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,960
but it's an example of a game with a

195
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,039
coordinate system from 1971. So, that

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,039
certainly seems like a feature that that

197
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,000
shows up repeatedly. Could you look up

198
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,320
Odell Fish? That was a I think a

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,039
descendant of that Odell fish game.

200
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah. Um but yeah, it was No, there was

201
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,120
an older version. There was one from the

202
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
198 1986 that it pretty much was just a

203
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,480
fish and you had to not get eaten by the

204
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
otter. So all you had to do was like

205
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,720
move up and down and it was riveting for

206
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,920
third graders in mid 90s. So

207
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,920
what's it?

208
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Yes.

209
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:10,950
[Music]

210
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm not quite getting down a little bit.

211
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,800
It's not Yeah, it's not letting me. Uh

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,600
there. This is the upto-date graphics,

213
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,160
too, guys. That

214
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,640
was good. All right.

215
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,480
Um, are you

216
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,399
all too old to How many of you had

217
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,600
Cahoot as sort of a central part of your

218
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,000
middle school or high school? All right.

219
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,120
Even we won't. How what what's your what

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,880
year did you graduate high school,

221
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Jiren? 2019. 2019. It's still

222
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:48,320
It was used it a lot in high school

223
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,320
though. Like like 2015 like a lot pretty

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,519
pretty substantial. How how did it get

225
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,680
integrated into

226
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,680
um classroom experience?

227
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,839
I think like eventually my school had a

228
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,640
program of like we had like Chromebooks

229
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,560
and so then that like just sort of

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,600
naturally led to okay like we already

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,440
all have our Chromebooks like we're like

232
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,320
do some sort of quiz or whatever and it

233
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,560
you know it gets real intense in the

234
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,959
classroom obviously.

235
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
Do do people are nodding? You generally

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,839
like think of cahoot fondly like that

237
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
was a good sort of I mean I I built

238
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,959
similar things in my class when I was a

239
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,920
teacher in 2003. I don't know somehow I

240
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,680
had I had a I had a Jeopardy setup um

241
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,240
that was with like a PowerPoint thing

242
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,560
where I just deleted little like blocks

243
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,160
to show the questions and then people

244
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
guessed answers and stuff like that. So

245
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,720
the sort of quiz show format. I mean

246
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,880
it's not you know it's it really is not

247
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
that is a classic example of sort of

248
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
gamification or chocolate covered

249
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
broccoli like there's no uh there's

250
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,399
there's no intrinsic game mechanic

251
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,399
that's in there. This is like like

252
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,680
competition over you know review

253
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
questions or knowledge or things like

254
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,040
that. But it ends up being pretty I mean

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,160
it's not you know um widely enjoyed by

256
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,519
learners from lots of different

257
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,360
backgrounds and things like that. I feel

258
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,079
like it stems from like just being fed

259
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,920
broccoli your whole life.

260
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,079
chocolate broccoli. Like, man, this is

261
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
great. It's so Yeah. Yeah. No, I think

262
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,880
that's right. It's like, man, this is so

263
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
much better than just doing a review.

264
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,640
This is so much better than whatever the

265
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,880
like typical routine of class is. Um,

266
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,519
name Oh, great. It's like you get to

267
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,800
write your own custom name. Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,040
You know, there are a bunch there's

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
those identity components. There's a

270
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,279
sort of surprise components. It's also

271
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,680
like outside of Jeopardy being like a

272
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,760
group thing like everyone gets to give

273
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,120
an answer. Every everybody gets to give

274
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
an answer. Yeah. It does some good

275
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,240
mechanics. Um doesn't Cahoot have things

276
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,920
where on your own display it like

277
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
there's a classwide leaderboard, but

278
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,760
there's sort of your own personal

279
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,200
leaderboard. So like you're like even if

280
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,440
like even if you're getting demolished

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,560
in class, like it just shows you

282
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
competing against the people who are

283
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,760
nearest to you. So that there's far away

284
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,600
five points behind this other player.

285
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's giving

286
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,320
you relative uh some some I mean like uh

287
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,600
like Pelaton and other kinds of things

288
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
do that right like I don't know I don't

289
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,079
have a Pelaton but I you know I think as

290
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,519
these sort of leaderboard systems you

291
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,880
know across distributing computing

292
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,160
environments are developed they're like

293
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,440
oh you don't have to compete against you

294
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,519
know if you if you have people compete

295
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,360
against everyone and only one person can

296
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,120
win. If you have like everybody

297
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,720
competing against a small subset which

298
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
is not necessarily overlapping with

299
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,959
anybody else's subset then like you know

300
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,760
everybody but one can beat somebody in

301
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,040
some kind of way. Um you know and then

302
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
you make up some other people and they

303
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,560
can beat the rest of them. um good other

304
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,480
games have people played that were

305
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,920
um I guess like related to like

306
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,240
expanding what a learning game is like

307
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:49,519
um I most of my youth I guess I was uh

308
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,959
in Iran so like didn't really have like

309
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,639
the internet bandage for like the like

310
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,120
online learning games or anything and

311
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,000
learning games in general were like not

312
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,120
a thing that I was really aware of until

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,040
I got to the US but I guess Like some

314
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,240
stuff that I thought about was like

315
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,040
um uh one specific one is like my

316
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,519
parents got me a toy sewing machine that

317
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,839
was like functional. Um and I learned

318
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,800
how to sew with that and then generally

319
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,279
just like uh it was like gamification of

320
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,279
arts and crafts a lot of time. My mom

321
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,920
would give me a bunch of like stuff be

322
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,320
like go make something with this and and

323
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,800
like my sister and I are very much like

324
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,639
perfectionists. So like we would always

325
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,839
be like, "Oh, like I want it to be like

326
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,880
this." And then my mom would be like,

327
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,720
"Okay, well if you want that like here's

328
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,279
some like exploration of like how you

329
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,279
want to be able to do that." And I think

330
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,519
like a lot of that was like one like

331
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,440
obviously like the skill itself of like

332
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,440
I learned how to sew with a sewing

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,720
machine and stuff like that, but also

334
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,920
like a lot of practice of like um um uh

335
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,000
what do you call it like spatial

336
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,800
understanding and like how do you write

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,959
letters on a poster so that they're not

338
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,240
like all bunch stuff at one end and just

339
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,959
like how to like plan like a certain

340
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
space effectively. and things like that.

341
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah. What what makes that what makes

342
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,800
that a game to you as opposed to like a

343
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,720
playful apprenticehip or

344
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,120
um I guess some of it might be just like

345
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,760
the stakes. I was just like and then

346
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,160
like I guess it is um

347
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
um I mean maybe it was also just a

348
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,399
little bit influenced by like how it was

349
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,320
presented I guess of like it was just

350
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,360
like like if it has like some pretend

351
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,519
aspect or of like oh like if it's a

352
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,760
competition with my sister or things

353
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
like that I guess. Yeah. Famously you

354
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
know there are philosophers who've tried

355
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,720
to pin down the word game and some of

356
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
them have concluded it's not possible. I

357
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,399
think Whit Wickenstein was one of the

358
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,959
ones who uh who said that there that

359
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:03,360
there really is no um there's no way to

360
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,120
to accept to create a definition of game

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,399
that correctly includes all the things

362
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,519
that people think should be included and

363
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
excludes all the things that people

364
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,199
think should be excluded. It's quite

365
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
difficult to figure out um what what

366
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,519
gameness is, you know, and how it

367
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
relates to sports or play or other, you

368
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,440
know, the real life other kinds of

369
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,839
activities. Um, but that's great that

370
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,199
those things sort of felt uh felt

371
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,040
gameful to you. Um, they certain they

372
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,720
certainly have a bunch of what what you

373
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
describe immediately evokes sort of

374
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,560
situated learning kinds of things of

375
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,839
like, oh, you know, my like my mom does

376
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,120
this thing and so she gave me a little

377
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,320
version of this thing and then we did

378
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,760
some of that stuff and she gave us some

379
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,800
tasks and we played around with them.

380
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,560
Um, and it is funny

381
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,519
how, you know, across cultures, across

382
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,920
history, um, young people really like

383
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,120
playing at what adults do. Um, I have a

384
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,120
great photograph from Messiah, um, with

385
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
this little, uh, three-year-old Messiah

386
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,440
dude dude who's got a long stick, um,

387
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,000
and a set of rocks in the sand, and he's

388
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,160
sort of whacking the the rocks in the

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,079
sand because Messiah are all herders.

390
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,680
Um, and so he just watched his older

391
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,959
brothers grow up hurting goats. And he

392
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
knew that he was gonna end up hurting

393
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,639
goats. And it's, you know, like there's

394
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,560
like a lot of goat hurting going on. But

395
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
a thing that's fun for him is to grab a

396
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,000
couple rocks, pretend they're goats, and

397
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,120
start hurting them around in the sand.

398
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,440
And I think it's funny because it's

399
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,759
relatable, you know, um to to whatever

400
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,680
whatever culture you're in. Um, playing

401
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,600
at being older is a big part of

402
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,440
youth. Um, good. Other other games that

403
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,199
people played? Yeah, Omar. Um, this one

404
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,839
might unlock a couple memories, but

405
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,040
Starfall was a big part of my childhood.

406
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,120
No. What's that? It's uh I primarily

407
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,839
played it during uh kindergarten and

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,920
preschool and first grade. Um, yes, that

409
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
first link. Um, but I they added a whole

410
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
new section that I don't even remember

411
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,040
like I don't ever recall seeing that.

412
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,199
So, they significantly updated the

413
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,279
website, but that was where I really did

414
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,800
a lot of um sort of like uh reading,

415
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,639
intro to reading. Uhhuh. Um, and I mean

416
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,880
for me it got pretty old pretty fast,

417
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,679
but like it's very nostalgic nowadays.

418
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,760
So, um, that was one of them. And then

419
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,760
also like Leaf Frog Toys. So,

420
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
we had like a computer lab and we'd all

421
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,760
go there and we'd like watch these and

422
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,160
it was like really cool. Um, especially

423
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,240
cuz like we didn't have like a um a lot

424
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
of like computing technology when I like

425
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,919
grew up at that time. So, it was really

426
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,600
cool to see this kind of a kind of a a

427
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
special highlight for the day to be able

428
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
to do these kind of things, you know,

429
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
and and and I hope that as you think

430
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,320
about these kinds of things, think about

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
Cahoot and stuff like that that your

432
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,640
mind drifts back to what you read in

433
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,640
Larry Cuban and his description of kind

434
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
of the material concerns of teachers,

435
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
the schedule concerns of teachers of

436
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,880
things like, oh, it's pretty handy to be

437
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,720
able to have a bunch of like digital

438
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
books that people find extremely

439
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
compelling to shove six-year-olds in

440
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,000
front of for an hour during the day so

441
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,480
you can like finish your lunch or do

442
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,120
some grading or do a little PR planning

443
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
and prep for other times of the day. Um

444
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,679
I don't know if this is well studied but

445
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,320
I bet uh you know Larry Cuban's finding

446
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,760
that that uh television and film strips

447
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
were more likely to be used at the end

448
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,799
of the day in elementary schools

449
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,039
probably parallels findings that you

450
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,760
might have today about when cahoot games

451
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,000
or other things like this get used uh in

452
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,640
the in the rhythm of the day and so

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,640
forth. Um so uh yeah different different

454
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,919
technologies but we can apply some of

455
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,840
the similar sorts of uh analytic tools

456
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,000
and frameworks to them. Good. Um what

457
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,280
are some things that I wanted to let me

458
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
let me talk let me talk for you a little

459
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,640
bit and then I'll give you a little bit

460
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,320
of chance to play some games. Um and

461
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,200
then uh and then we can talk a little

462
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,640
bit about transfer. Um, one thing that I

463
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,679
just wanted to draw your attention to

464
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,160
that's in the syllabus is uh for failure

465
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,679
disrupt in the rabbit hole readings that

466
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,320
you're not required to do. One of those

467
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,280
links for every chapter is a podcast

468
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,400
episode. Um, and uh I was thinking about

469
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,160
them because some people who are missing

470
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,440
class this week because of Sloan SIP

471
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,799
week. I was going to recommend those to

472
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,919
them as sort of supplementary kind of

473
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,000
things. But for the um uh this chapter

474
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
in particular, Scott Auststerhile who

475
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
developed the logical journey of the

476
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,559
Zubinis is one of the guests and then

477
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,840
Constant Steiner who actually had a job

478
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,840
for a while in the US Department of

479
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,679
Education thinking about um the role of

480
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,960
games in education systems is there.

481
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,840
Probably one of the most fun things

482
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,240
about the podcast episodes um is that I

483
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,480
really encouraged the people who came to

484
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,880
disagree with me. Um and so

485
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,360
um you in in most episodes there there

486
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,360
are uh you know claims made about where

487
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,840
the book is wrong by very well-informed

488
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,679
people um on those topics. So so

489
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,520
Constant Steiner does not agree with me

490
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
in this episode about uh the

491
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,600
relationship between games and learning

492
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,720
and transfer and it's fun to to listen

493
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,640
to that. Um, I think uh Mitch and

494
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,679
Natalie had some disagreements with me

495
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,000
in in uh about uh what the what the

496
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
learning goals of Scratch are um in

497
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,679
practice. So, those can be kind of fun.

498
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
So, I don't know you're going for a run

499
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,960
or something like that. You need some

500
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,480
light podcast listening to these can be

501
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
fun episodes. If you're if you're not

502
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,919
getting enough education technology in

503
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,880
your three hours a week with me, um

504
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,320
there's more to be had.

505
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Um so the way that this chapter is

506
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,160
structured is I call it sort of testing

507
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,600
this theory of the genres of learning at

508
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,679
scale. um which is um what you should be

509
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,760
you know the the reason part a big

510
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,760
reason for organizing um the the the

511
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,200
idea of three genres of learning at

512
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,559
scale is I want people to be able to

513
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,400
take new technologies and say oh that is

514
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
kind of like this and if we can say oh

515
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
that's kind of like this then we can say

516
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,039
all right so we probably know something

517
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,799
about its technology we probably know

518
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,559
something about the sort of pedagogical

519
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,240
underpinnings we can make some guess

520
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,080
about research like a big thing that I

521
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
would want someone who reads failure to

522
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,600
disrupt

523
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,600
to be able to do is to like look at new

524
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,200
AI tools and be like, okay, you know, we

525
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,640
did not have generative pre-trained

526
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,080
transformers that were pretty useful

527
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,200
until November of 2022, but like the

528
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
things that we're trying to do with them

529
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
are going to be similar to other kind of

530
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,360
stuff that we've done in the past, and

531
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,720
we should be able to slot the things

532
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,760
that we're going to do to them into

533
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,039
different kinds of categories. Um, games

534
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,360
struck me as a good testing place for

535
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,440
this because it's it's not the case that

536
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
I think games fit neatly into one of

537
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
these three categories of

538
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,600
instructorguided learning at scale or

539
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440
algorithm guided learning at scale or

540
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,400
peer guided learning at scale. But I do

541
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,080
think that any given game probably fits

542
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,720
into one of those categories pretty

543
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,360
nicely or has some sort of like

544
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,200
recognizable hybridity across those

545
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,679
categories. Um, so something like Math

546
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,520
Blaster, um, you know, is is is kind of

547
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
an example of, you know, you could

548
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,720
decide whether or not it's sort of

549
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,240
instructorg guided learning at scale or

550
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
algorithm guided learning at scale or

551
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,600
something like that. Doesn't really have

552
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,200
a lot of item response theory to it. Um,

553
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,760
you know, but it's but it's basically

554
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
just an autograder. Um, you know, you go

555
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,960
you go in, you're given a type of

556
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,480
problem, you practice that problem over

557
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,159
and over again. Maybe the difficulty

558
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,120
goes up and you practice sort of another

559
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,559
type of problem. Um, had any of you ever

560
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,000
heard of Vanished before? Maybe some of

561
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,960
you in the other in the games for

562
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,159
learning classes you read about

563
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,360
Vanished. Um, so Vanished, which I write

564
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,640
about a little bit in the book, was this

565
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,919
really cool project that the MIT uh uh

566
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,720
education arcade did with the

567
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,600
Smithsonian Museum? It was any watch the

568
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,280
television show Lost? Um, okay. So, a

569
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
couple nods there. I don't Have any of

570
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
you ever participated? I I mean, it

571
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,039
actually d I don't know. Like are you

572
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,559
all aware what's going on with Kate

573
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,000
Middleton right now where people are

574
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,520
like trying to figure out like why she's

575
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
not showing up in public and sort of all

576
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,400
these conspiracies theories show up

577
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,440
about it and people do these detective

578
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
work. There's a bunch of things like

579
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,640
that or like I don't know um when the

580
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,919
Malaysian airline flight crashed and

581
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,840
nobody really knew. I don't know there

582
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,559
there's something that human beings have

583
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,559
that's like let's all kind of solve the

584
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,120
mystery together and it gets kind of

585
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,520
woven into conspiratorial thinking. It

586
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,400
overlaps nicely with fiction with things

587
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,640
like Lost or um sort of other television

588
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,280
shows that do that. But but Vanished was

589
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,159
basically like an alternate reality game

590
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,880
that was sort of played out on the web

591
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,799
um where there were codes to break.

592
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
There were secret messages spread across

593
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,240
websites. There were sort of scientific

594
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,679
claims that were happening. Other sorts

595
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
of thing. There are messages from the

596
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,600
future being beamed back into the past.

597
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,840
um and students signed up um to like

598
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,240
either as classes or individuals to sort

599
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,000
of like get the kind of messages that

600
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,000
went along. I think the game ran for a

601
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,640
couple months or something like that. Um

602
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,880
but very much a sort of peerguided

603
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
learning at scale kind of example like

604
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,559
you know just like a series of puzzles

605
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
put out there that you collaboratively

606
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,240
tried to solve. you had to interact with

607
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:51,760
other people um to kind of find

608
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:56,000
um a big you know the these two kinds of

609
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,440
games um illustrate uh some of the basic

610
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,919
principles that we were just talking a

611
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,400
about a little bit. Um Math Blaster. So

612
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,760
what you did in Math Blaster is you like

613
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,919
took that little character and you ran

614
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,360
it back and forth to get the get the

615
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,720
correct answer. Actually, what was the

616
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,640
what was the penguin game that we just

617
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,279
played? What was that called? Penguin

618
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,320
Race Off or something? Yes, I think so.

619
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,600
Yeah. So, so penguin penguin raceoff um

620
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,240
is uh is an example of what sometimes

621
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,400
gets called gamification, which is how

622
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,760
do we take a mathematic how do we take

623
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
an intellectual exercise that we think

624
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,760
is useful for people and put game

625
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,200
elements on it to inspire people to do

626
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,679
that activity? Um, uh, what what other

627
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,320
kinds of software have you played with

628
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,960
that takes like basically a worksheet

629
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,440
activity and add sort of game elements

630
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,440
on top of it?

631
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,600
It's kind of like thinking about the

632
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,159
what the slide you presented earlier

633
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,480
like Dolingo kind of Yep. Dolingo has a

634
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,080
ton of gamification built into it like

635
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,320
in you know I don't know how many of you

636
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,559
how many of you use Dolingo or have used

637
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,640
it. Oh just a couple. Okay. So maybe

638
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,840
more people play around with it. Um but

639
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,679
you know they have millions of people

640
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,200
who are doing little language activities

641
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,640
but a big part of why they're doing like

642
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,960
the little language activities are not

643
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,880
that inherently fun. Um but what are the

644
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,200
features in Dualingo that try to like

645
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,080
get people hooked to to do it and keep

646
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,400
doing it?

647
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,840
Streaks. Streaks are a big one. Yeah.

648
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,919
you know, which is just like a number

649
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,559
that you try to increment every day.

650
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,080
That's kind of a game.

651
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,799
Visual design. What kind of elements? Uh

652
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,520
colorful design, interactive design, all

653
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,080
of these like bubbly like feelings to

654
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
everything in it. Yep. Yep. So, yeah, it

655
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,720
like creating it and turning into a

656
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
playful space. Some of the most

657
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
important visual elements are when you

658
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,320
get something right. Um there's usually

659
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,640
like a little flash you for sound, a

660
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,400
little ding. Um, Edex had these big

661
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,159
green check marks for a while when you

662
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
got answers correct. I think another

663
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
thing that's been like a recent

664
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,799
development has been their PR. Um,

665
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,440
recently like at least on Tik Tok like

666
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,880
Duolingo's like gone unhinged. Um, and

667
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,279
like the birds like everywhere and it

668
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,440
like comments on weird things and like

669
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,559
every time it comments somewhere like

670
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,640
there's like a million like like replies

671
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,640
to it. Um, and I think like wanting to

672
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,400
be like a part of that community or like

673
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,880
say I've done that is also like a big

674
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,720
thing in society today. Yeah. Good.

675
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:33,600
Um, Mari who's not here wrote in like to

676
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,679
me um uh uh Dolingo when I think about

677
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,840
it is sort of a classic example of kind

678
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
of

679
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,679
gamification. Um, you know, sort of very

680
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,960
instructionist kind of inspired like

681
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,159
let's just put some game elements on

682
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
stuff. And Mario wrote an essay was

683
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,080
like, "No, actually this thing is like

684
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,559
super motivated by situated learning."

685
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,320
Um, the way that it makes you like

686
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,159
things like that are like, "Oh, like the

687
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
duo bird is out there and I can have a

688
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,760
parasocial relationship with the duo

689
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,520
bird and it will comment on my TikTok

690
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,679
feeds and I can respond to it and things

691
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,960
like that." Um, got me thinking a little

692
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
bit differently about it. Maybe we keep

693
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,159
talking about that. Um, yeah, the the

694
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,400
the the term of art for this uh kind of

695
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
approach is chocolatecovered broccoli.

696
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
um that basically like this is super

697
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,320
boring math to do, but we're just gonna

698
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,919
like pour chocolate on it to get you to

699
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,279
try to do more of it. And of course,

700
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,279
like the joke of chocolate covered

701
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,200
broccoli is that like chocolate covered

702
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,360
broccoli does actually not taste that

703
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
good. Um and Math Blaster is actually

704
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,240
not that fun. Like it's fun for a little

705
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,880
while and then you're like, "Oh, I'm

706
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,279
just doing division."

707
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,120
um whereas Vanished um and other kinds

708
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,120
of games like it there's not a there's

709
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,039
not an as well accepted name, but my my

710
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,360
colleagues at the education arcade um

711
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,600
refer to these games as resonant games.

712
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,240
Um and a key feature of resonant games

713
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,200
is that instead of trying to add game

714
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,120
elements on top of some kind of

715
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,919
intellectual exercise, you're trying to

716
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,440
find the playfulness in the intellectual

717
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,840
exercise. like what it's not it's not um

718
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,960
how do we how do we add game mechanics

719
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,520
to math. It's what is already fun and

720
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,919
playful and interesting in math and then

721
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,399
how do we have that fun and playfulness

722
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,159
kind of surface and emerge so that you

723
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,600
so that we get learners to engage with

724
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,200
that first. um in in vanished like how

725
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,360
do we teach scientific thinking,

726
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,679
scientific practices by having those

727
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,399
practices emerge kind of naturally in

728
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,760
this sort of conspiratorial mystery kind

729
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,760
of story um that happens. Um, oh, good.

730
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,919
These, this is a great example of what

731
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,000
Khalil was just talking about of, uh,

732
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,080
um, uh, yeah, the very the very sort of

733
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
playful environment that like we'll give

734
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,440
you some experience points. We'll tell

735
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,279
you about your time. We'll call you

736
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,880
amazing. We'll give you these funny

737
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,440
little sticker. I mean, like this is

738
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
this is I don't know if any of you do

739
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,120
did your elementary teachers like put

740
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,000
stickers on successful assignments and

741
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,360
stuff like that. Can you think of like

742
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
gold stars and stuff like that? Yeah,

743
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,320
this is just like a digital version of

744
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,799
that. is the same kind of thing. Let's

745
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,440
give you some kind of visual reward

746
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,320
reminder to get you to keep playing and

747
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,159
doing these things. Um,

748
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,399
uh, this is one that I talk about in the

749
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,600
book, uh, Lumosity, which maybe we'll

750
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,919
talk about a little bit later when we

751
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,080
talk about, uh, transfer and things like

752
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,279
that. Um, all right. So, I would like to

753
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,960
invite you to play two of these games,

754
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,320
and you can find these links in the

755
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,760
syllabus, but why don't we take 15

756
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,159
minutes or so and let you pull out some

757
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,440
computers. Um, I'm going to give you I'm

758
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,640
going to give you maybe before you pull

759
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
them out, let me just explain these four

760
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
things and then you can do whatever you

761
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,520
want with them. Um, the first one is

762
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,559
Math Blaster. Um, I could I don't think

763
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,440
I successfully found the 1983 version. I

764
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,200
think I found a 1996 one. Um, but you

765
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,760
should play a few rounds of Math Blaster

766
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,840
and see what all the hype is about. Um,

767
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,480
the second game is the logical journey

768
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,720
of the of the Zoominis. Um, which was a

769
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,640
key part of Erin's childhood. And so now

770
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
she'll get to go back to that. It has a

771
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,679
really long kind of intro story and

772
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,799
stuff like that. You if that's what

773
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,760
you're into, you can do that. But if you

774
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,600
want to play the game, you'll have to

775
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,200
like skip a bunch of introductory stuff

776
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,480
to get into some interesting sort of

777
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,080
combinatorics kinds of things. Um, one

778
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,760
thing which is not a game, but if any of

779
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,919
you are big Minecraft fans, um, I gave

780
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,799
you a link to what is essentially the

781
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,080
Minecraft website for teachers. Um, you

782
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,360
won't be able to unless you have got

783
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,559
Minecraft on your computer, you won't be

784
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,640
able to jump in there and play with

785
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,200
things. But a thing that you can do is

786
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,600
go to like their lesson plan finder.

787
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,880
Um, and uh, that's probably the most

788
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
useful probably the thing you'd find

789
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,159
most interesting is go to explore

790
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,480
lessons and pick a topic you're

791
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,880
interested in and you know see whether

792
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,240
or not you think the you know good going

793
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,120
back to the coordinate system like how

794
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
do you uh um, you know, how to how would

795
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,320
how would you use Minecraft to teach the

796
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,720
coordinate system and they've got all

797
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,240
kinds of guiding activities and student

798
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,600
activities and you won't be able to see

799
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,679
the world that's associated with them

800
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,440
but each one of these lessons has a kind

801
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,640
of Minecraft space that's been built,

802
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
you can at least get some screenshots

803
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,200
from it. And then if anybody hasn't

804
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
played Dualingo, it it it's not it you

805
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,720
could probably pretty quickly start

806
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,240
creating an account um and doing some

807
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,840
things like that. Um if you want to do

808
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,080
it with a person next to you, you should

809
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,320
feel free to do that. Um the easiest

810
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,600
place to find all of these links, you

811
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,720
could just Google them, but they are on

812
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,039
the syllabus, um bit.lym

813
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,679
LMT syllabus and then uh

814
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,679
um on the on the day for learning games

815
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
I've put uh four of these links there.

816
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,799
Um so it's 1:35. Why don't we take until

817
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,080
about 1:50 and just let you uh and feel

818
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,279
free to do it with a partner or

819
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,799
something like that. And if they've got

820
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,080
sound, you turn on the sound quietly and

821
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,440
stuff like that so you can hear it

822
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,720
without bothering people next to you.

823
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,559
But they're but they're pretty fun

824
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,039
things to mess around with. Sound good?

825
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,039
Ready? Go.

826
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,840
All right. So, having having who who

827
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
played around with Zooinis? Looked like

828
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,720
we had a lot of Zoominis player. What

829
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,120
are what are your reactions having spent

830
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,279
some time with Zooinis?

831
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,200
It's cute.

832
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:59,840
It takes so long. I I just I want like

833
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,720
go hurry up. Then you get to see them

834
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,039
walk up and bounce up. Yeah. Yeah. So

835
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,919
yeah. So the more you know the more I it

836
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,360
actually you know most of you were

837
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,679
playing with sound off which might be a

838
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,000
mistake because I think part of the part

839
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,919
of the stakes of Zoominis are set like

840
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,679
there's a narrator in the back who tells

841
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,840
you about how the Zoominis were

842
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,559
oppressed and you're saving them and

843
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,120
things like that and have like um you

844
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,760
know having you having you develop a

845
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,120
kind of affinity for them is is in a

846
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,720
sort of storytelling world is part of

847
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,240
the game having them be cute I think is

848
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,320
important that you develop some care for

849
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,480
them um and want to engage with them and

850
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,880
things like that sort of the more in

851
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,039
fact the more you peel away those

852
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,960
elements and ju the the kind of

853
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,720
narrative elements the social elements

854
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,679
the artistic elements and just get down

855
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,679
to the math the more like that that

856
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,159
could that could risk some of the fun of

857
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,159
the engagement I'd rather play Sudoku

858
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,919
rather play okay good yeah which is just

859
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,080
like a straight immersion into like yeah

860
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,159
and and those kinds of personal

861
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,159
preferences raise some real challenges

862
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,000
for teachers right like for like you

863
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
Imagine having, you know, if you were to

864
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,919
take time in a math class to have people

865
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,440
play the logical journey of the Zubinis,

866
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,799
there'd be some kids who are like, "This

867
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
is the best day of class ever." And

868
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,559
there'd be other kids who are like, "H,

869
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,679
can we just go back to doing whatever we

870
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,360
were doing before?" Um, and uh it's like

871
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,440
an expensive investment of time and

872
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,960
other kinds of things to to have a

873
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,279
third-year class be like, "Ah, this

874
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,120
game's not that fun."

875
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,880
Emily, did it did it sell you eventually

876
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,519
or?

877
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Yeah,

878
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,720
I I would say I I kind of like it.

879
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,159
Good. I think it's just

880
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,640
um I don't know. It It could be like

881
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,880
that tendency like you said of like

882
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
create like having an affinity for that

883
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,720
or like, oh, it's like these like cute

884
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,760
little creatures like going across your

885
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,760
screen and like um how much you enjoy

886
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,120
that or how much you might care for

887
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,919
that. And I'm I'm very much down for a

888
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,000
fun little game with little cute

889
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,080
characters and identities and things

890
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,559
like that. But I feel like it might just

891
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,480
be because like now I'm so used to like

892
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,639
things having to happen like very

893
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,079
quickly cuz like even like lectures I

894
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159
tend to watch them like in two times

895
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,320
speed instead of like the normal way

896
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,480
like the normal time. So then it's like

897
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,560
watching playing these games are so slow

898
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,000
that I'm just like you've lost my

899
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,000
attention. I don't want to play it

900
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,520
anymore. Good. Yeah. There's there's a

901
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,359
little kind of gap in there. Wait, I

902
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
have a question. Did you guys like skip

903
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,639
the like transitions or were you sitting

904
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,720
through them? I clicked out of skip

905
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,639
them. Yeah.

906
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,560
Okay. Cuz the the the transitions are

907
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,720
like I see what you mean, but like the

908
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,200
transitions are like Okay. Like you're

909
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,679
slowly highlighting the next place I'm

910
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,760
going in the map for like a minute and

911
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,960
it's like, okay, I I've seen enough. It

912
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,399
was fun to like figure out what the sort

913
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,560
of traits were that they were selecting

914
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,000
for, but then like you kind of inst I

915
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
felt like I instantly found the traits

916
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
and then I was just like, "Oh, okay.

917
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,920
I'll just like there I didn't really

918
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,079
have to like completely, you know, do

919
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,240
like a crazy search for the traits or

920
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,920
whatever." Like I was just like, "Oh,

921
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,520
okay. Well, maybe this hair is good."

922
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,000
And then all that hair turned out to be

923
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,200
fine. I'm like, "Oh, okay. Great."

924
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,920
I mean, it might have been harder if you

925
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,839
were 10, but Well, actually, to build

926
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,440
those two together, I'm like try I don't

927
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,599
remember like when I was going through

928
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,440
this game as a young person if I

929
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,839
recognized or was even looking for the

930
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,359
traits. Like I think maybe I I might

931
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,280
have been more pulled to like the

932
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,800
affinity to the characters and like, oh

933
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,240
no, they got bounced back. That's not

934
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
good. And just like doing I would do it

935
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,520
with my sisters and we just like drop

936
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,520
them all over the place and see if they

937
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,760
go in. that I cannot remember if I like

938
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,280
noticed that there were conditions and I

939
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,400
just we cared we were okay with the

940
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,079
slowness because we cared more about

941
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,839
just getting them through it didn't

942
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,839
matter like and I can't remember and

943
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,320
that's killing me a little bit. Yeah. Um

944
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,079
how many of you clicked the the question

945
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,800
mark hint button that has an explanation

946
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,520
and how many didn't discover the um it's

947
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,280
kind of an interesting design feature um

948
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,640
to be able to say that uh um you you can

949
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,920
you can play you can play the game

950
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,200
without any instructions about how to

951
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,640
play the game. you're just like put in

952
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,160
the world, start clicking things around,

953
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,760
start moving things around. If you had

954
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,200
to put the logical um journeys of the

955
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,040
Zoominis as instructor guided learning

956
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,599
at scale, algorithm guided learning at

957
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,400
scale, or um peer guided learning at

958
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,400
scale, what would you call it?

959
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,440
I feel like instructor guided learning.

960
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,400
Um, it's not like if I was able to solve

961
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,800
all of the like or get all of the Zenis

962
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,160
through on like one or two errors that

963
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,480
it would automatically jump to like

964
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,839
level five. Yep. Um, like there's very

965
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,359
much like a sequence that you're

966
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,720
supposed to follow. Um, and I when I

967
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,040
would place one and then it would try

968
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,480
and go up and felt like an autograder of

969
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,599
like it's like this is either pass or

970
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,520
fail. H yeah, the autograder is a lot

971
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,960
more fun because like a thing crosses a

972
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,320
bridge or gets kicked back or somebody

973
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,520
eats a pizza but doesn't eat a pizza,

974
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,599
but it's not really any different from a

975
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,680
green check or a red check or other

976
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,040
kinds of things like that. Um no, the

977
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,720
way the way that I argued that Zoominis

978
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,640
fit is that it's instructor learning at

979
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,000
scale with an autograder. However,

980
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,680
almost every MOO is inspired by more um

981
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,680
instructivist kinds of approaches. And

982
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,680
this is very much more inspired by kind

983
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,359
of a situated learning apprenticeship

984
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,520
kind of approach where it's almost

985
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,920
trying to trying to hide the autograder,

986
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,280
trying to hide the instructor. Um it's I

987
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,560
mean it's very much trying to hide the

988
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
instructions. You know, it says just

989
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,320
like go into this world, immerse

990
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,079
yourself into this world, play around,

991
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
see what happens. There's sort of

992
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,119
winning and losing, but like it's

993
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,880
actually, you know, it's actually fine

994
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,720
to fail a level. Well, it's fine to have

995
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,720
all your Zoominis kick back. You can try

996
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,720
again and rescue some other Zoominis,

997
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,880
other sorts of things. Um, you know,

998
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,440
there's there's no point in the game

999
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,240
where it stops and is like, "Okay, kids,

1000
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,359
like actually, we're teaching you

1001
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,560
combinotaurics." Um, or, you know, or

1002
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,400
probability or whatever else you think

1003
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,400
is the mathematics of the game. It just

1004
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,640
lets that be a kind of, you know,

1005
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,839
natural learning that that happens

1006
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,880
throughout. um you know there are there

1007
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,640
are other you know so this is this is an

1008
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,920
exercise that I think is the kind of

1009
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,480
thing that might be helpful if you were

1010
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,000
um you know a department head a teacher

1011
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
trying to figure out whether or not you

1012
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,839
should adopt this technology in your

1013
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,680
classroom um which is sort of for any

1014
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,359
new technology three good questions to

1015
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,960
ask or who drives and control the pace

1016
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,079
and path of learning what are the

1017
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,079
technologies here what are the

1018
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,920
pedagogies and then sort of what can I

1019
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,760
predict will happen in my educational

1020
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,880
system given a consequence of this

1021
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,720
design. So like Math Blaster is pretty

1022
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,160
pretty instructor guided. It's got an

1023
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,440
autograder. I mean they're just

1024
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,000
worksheet problems. There's no

1025
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,760
difference between um that and a

1026
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,359
worksheet problem except like maybe I

1027
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,200
will slightly motivate some of my

1028
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,280
students to do more worksheet problems

1029
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,640
because like there's aliens and it's

1030
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,920
kind of fun and things like that. But

1031
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,599
maybe not. Maybe there's some people who

1032
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,359
are like ah I really don't want to have

1033
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,320
to like I just give me the math problems

1034
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,960
to answer.

1035
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Um I I had often thought of do How many

1036
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,680
of you played around with Duolingo for

1037
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,520
the first time as you're clicking around

1038
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,680
here? Any sort of new Dolingo people? Um

1039
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,040
you know it certainly is algorithm

1040
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,160
guided as it's trying to you know

1041
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,480
there's some there's a lot of good

1042
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,400
writing um the the the developers of

1043
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Dualingo keep blogs and other kinds of

1044
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,200
things where they talk about um you know

1045
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,320
for instance they they have a um have

1046
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,400
you ever heard of the concept of the

1047
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,920
zone of proximal development? This is

1048
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,280
sort of a classic educational concept

1049
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,119
that basically you want to try to as

1050
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,599
you're teaching people have there be a

1051
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,680
difficulty level where you feel sort of

1052
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,720
competent but also sort of stretched and

1053
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,079
you know if you're if things are too

1054
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,000
easy it's boring. If things are too hard

1055
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,560
it's boring. There's a zone of proximal

1056
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,240
sort of ideal development. Um for the

1057
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,160
they measure that zone of proximal

1058
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,599
development by saying like you you know

1059
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,960
we're trying to aim for people to have a

1060
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,079
certain kind of error rate. I don't know

1061
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,440
exactly what it is but it might be like

1062
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,040
we want you to get about 20% of the

1063
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,880
things you're hitting wrong. Um, if

1064
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,320
you're getting more than 20% wrong, then

1065
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,000
we're probably making it too hard,

1066
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,280
otherwise too easy. Um, but what are the

1067
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
I don't know what we talked a little

1068
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
bit, but what are some of the situated

1069
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,440
learning elements that you saw? If you

1070
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,760
were to say that there was not so

1071
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,079
instructionist, but it was more um

1072
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,440
inspired by kind of constructionism,

1073
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,560
situated learning. What kinds of things

1074
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,560
like that are in Dolingo?

1075
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,640
I like I found out Dolinda has a music

1076
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
thing now which is really cool because

1077
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,640
I've always wanted to learn music. I

1078
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,640
like play around with that but I don't

1079
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,040
understand it. Like I can't read notes

1080
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,520
or anything. I just like think and then

1081
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,160
play piano. But it's more interesting to

1082
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,839
see like they had this they had this

1083
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,680
stupid simulation of playing hot cross

1084
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,160
buns and I swear I could play that if I

1085
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,720
tried. But doing it with their little

1086
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,560
app, it was like you had to paste it and

1087
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,400
you had to recognize the notes. And I

1088
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,000
went back to that like 10 times and it's

1089
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
like simulating playing the piano. It's

1090
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,200
really simple for like a computer game,

1091
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,040
but that was pretty engaging. So, so it

1092
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,720
sort of immersed you in the feeling of

1093
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,560
playing a piano even though you're kind

1094
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,400
of on your phone. That seems like a good

1095
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,119
quality of a situated apprenticeship

1096
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,400
kind of thing. Um, now you you had

1097
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,160
played Hot Cross Buns before. Um, I feel

1098
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,680
like I could just play it like sitting

1099
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,720
in a piano without like if I looked for

1100
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,280
the notes soundwise. Like I can't read

1101
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,079
piano notes, but like I can figure out

1102
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,000
songs if you tell me what they like if I

1103
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,920
hear them. Yeah. So, playing by ear.

1104
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,440
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So, yeah. Um, and and

1105
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,359
so you feel like this could be a pathway

1106
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,160
to doing I mean I I'm sort of

1107
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,079
increasingly convinced now that Dolingo

1108
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,119
um Dolingo came out of Carnegie Melon

1109
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,319
University and they have some of the

1110
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,599
best sort of learning scientists,

1111
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,880
learning engineers in the world and one

1112
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,880
of the things I like about them is that

1113
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,400
they're they're sort of methodological

1114
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
pluralists. They're like what are all

1115
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,319
the good ideas and how do we shove them

1116
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,079
all in there? Um so in some sense

1117
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,760
Dolingo like is very much

1118
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,440
instructionist. It's like taking big

1119
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,280
complex things and breaking it down into

1120
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,960
small pieces. It'll show you examples,

1121
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,640
then give you part tax practice and all

1122
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,079
those kinds of things. But it also has

1123
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,920
this way of like, well, let's give you

1124
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,440
an identity in this environment. Let's

1125
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,720
have you build a parasocial relationship

1126
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,560
with an owl. Let's feel like you're

1127
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,560
sitting down with a piano. Let's reward

1128
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,560
you. Let's help you go on a journey from

1129
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,400
being a newcomer to an old-timer by

1130
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,839
having badges and streaks and these

1131
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,760
other sorts of things with it. Kind of a

1132
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,920
nice blend um of uh of those things.

1133
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,200
Um, you know, um, we've talked a bunch

1134
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,680
in this class about how one of the

1135
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,119
signature challenges of self-paced

1136
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,400
online learning is that people are

1137
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,800
typically bad at it. Like people

1138
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,440
typically quit. Um, Duolingo has

1139
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,040
probably been as successful, maybe more

1140
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,000
successful than any other education

1141
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,240
technology company in building a product

1142
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,800
um, that's just super sticky for people.

1143
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,119
Um they they really have put a lot of

1144
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,839
effort into trying to break down the

1145
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:39,119
challenges of self-paced learning. Um

1146
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,119
and some you know through these

1147
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,720
gamifications through streaks through

1148
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,800
making it playful through having it feel

1149
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,839
like it'd be fun through I don't have

1150
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,280
have any of you quit tried to quit

1151
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,280
Dualingo like they send you heranging

1152
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,560
emails when you're not doing it enough

1153
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,200
and things like that. They've got all

1154
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,160
kinds of ways of trying to sort of

1155
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,680
continuously pull them in there. They're

1156
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,200
super scientific about all this stuff

1157
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,880
too. So, all like I'm sure all of those

1158
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,520
emails that you've ever gotten have been

1159
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,240
AB tested a zillion times. Um, all

1160
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,240
different kinds of timing and language

1161
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,520
they use and other things like that to

1162
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,560
sort of rope you back in. Um, good. How

1163
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,119
many of you looked around on the

1164
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,079
Minecraft um website? What did you find

1165
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,560
there, Khalil? Uh, I played like a game

1166
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:26,319
where like they're trying to like teach

1167
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:27,880
kids good game like stuff and it's still

1168
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,880
very like

1169
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:35,440
uh like there's not much to do just like

1170
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,319
go there do that should you feed the dog

1171
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,640
you probably should feed the

1172
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,640
dog. So it it feel it felt like a little

1173
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,680
bit forced in terms of the path that you

1174
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,920
could take. But after like oh doing

1175
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,520
these chores it it tells you hey you

1176
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,160
have to write this like good game guide

1177
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,240
book book and like oh what's the you

1178
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,960
should write like a certain instruction.

1179
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,200
Do you want an example? Oh what you did

1180
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,400
today was chores. You should do your

1181
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,640
chores before playing games. And then

1182
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,560
you get to write whatever you want,

1183
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,599
which case they don't really check what

1184
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,760
you write in there. But after that, you

1185
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,520
get to play like a little game where you

1186
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,240
shoot balloons, I guess. And then you're

1187
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,240
back into a new day. So it felt a lot of

1188
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,400
like

1189
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,960
uh a lot of like let's simulate life in

1190
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,319
Minecraft. You have like even you have

1191
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,240
parents in the game because they named

1192
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,000
them trusted adults.

1193
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,200
Uh but yeah, it felt it felt like a

1194
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,040
little bit too much like constrained in

1195
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,880
terms of what activity you could be

1196
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:49,680
doing and it felt uh like very like very

1197
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,920
much like clearly instructivist. I mean,

1198
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,640
I'm very much like an adult, so it's not

1199
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,920
like you're not the target audience for

1200
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,839
this, but I I hypothesize a kid would

1201
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,560
like recognize. Yeah. They are telling

1202
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,079
me to do my chores before playing games,

1203
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,480
but they're just doing it in Minecraft.

1204
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,079
Yeah. Yeah. I I think that's I mean to

1205
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,079
me how many of you are Minecraft players

1206
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,760
just like in your regular lives or were

1207
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,599
at some point in your you know to me the

1208
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,680
sort of joy of Minecraft the thing that

1209
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,560
they discovered was was the you know the

1210
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,440
the the joy of the boundlessness of just

1211
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,040
people inventing their own um missions

1212
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,160
and structure and things like that like

1213
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,520
there's a little bit of the overworld of

1214
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,800
the game but you know I mean for me it

1215
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,480
was always like all right I'm in a new

1216
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
world I will need a wizards tower like

1217
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,160
you know I had like a sort of construct

1218
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:36,480
in my mind of what I should live in um

1219
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,920
and it was a wizard's tower um And uh um

1220
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,440
you know that just cuts off it's very

1221
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,440
difficult to conduct educational

1222
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,040
activities which are like everyone go do

1223
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
whatever you want. I mean usually when

1224
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,040
you have some instructional activity

1225
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,200
you're like let's all do X you know. Um

1226
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,160
and so to some extent the kind of let's

1227
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,240
all do go do X is like directly against

1228
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,280
the fabric of one of the main things

1229
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,800
that makes Minecraft so special um is

1230
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,480
this open world where you can kind of do

1231
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
anything you want. Um, so there's a sort

1232
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,480
of um those those kinds of tensions show

1233
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,599
up all the time in you know I think you

1234
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,359
know could I think m Minecraft is

1235
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,680
incredibly sticky to young people. It is

1236
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,280
incredibly compelling and so you go oh

1237
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,359
maybe we could take this really sticky

1238
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,520
compelling world and have people do

1239
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,119
learning in it. But as soon as you add

1240
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,240
this dimension of okay you all have to

1241
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,000
do X inside my Minecraft world. Um it's

1242
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,200
uh it's often much much less compelling

1243
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,880
for people. you're sort of pull you're

1244
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,119
sort of taking away one of the key

1245
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,359
features that made it sticky um in the

1246
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,359
first place. Um but even if you want to

1247
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:42,079
do that, I think one of the central

1248
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:44,520
questions that games pose is

1249
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,800
um if you spend a lot of time in

1250
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,200
Minecraft, are there things that are

1251
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,520
that you're learning that are useful for

1252
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,720
other things or are you just learning

1253
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,200
how to play Minecraft? Um and that is a

1254
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,240
very old educational question. It is an

1255
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,839
educational question that actually

1256
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,520
somebody we've talked about a bunch. Um

1257
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,400
Edward Thorndikeke was one of the very

1258
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,680
earliest researchers in um and it

1259
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,400
relates to a problem that's called

1260
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,319
transfer. Um to what extent when you

1261
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,640
learn something can you take that

1262
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,720
learning and apply it into some other

1263
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,160
different kind of context. That is one

1264
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
of the most important questions we could

1265
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,960
ask in education. Um the more you

1266
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,359
believe that things learned in one

1267
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,000
context will help you do other kinds of

1268
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:27,599
things. Um, in some ways it sort of

1269
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,880
simplifies the education system. Like

1270
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,480
let's just get you to be really good

1271
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,319
thinkers in one domain and then you'll

1272
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,079
be good at all kinds of stuff. The more

1273
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,839
that you believe that things don't

1274
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,119
transfer very well, that people are

1275
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,960
really only good at doing the things

1276
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,960
that they're taught how to do, the more

1277
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,920
difficult and complex education become.

1278
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,680
In Thornikeke's time, um, the the the

1279
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,520
sort of thorny challenge that he was

1280
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,520
faced with, um, was that people were

1281
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,440
still big fans of sort of classical

1282
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,599
curriculum, um, teaching people Latin

1283
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,240
and Greek. Um, and the argument that was

1284
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,240
out there, um, was that if people got

1285
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,880
really good at learning Latin and Greek,

1286
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,640
they would learn sort of generically how

1287
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,319
to think well. They would learn how to

1288
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,520
think well, how to communicate well. I

1289
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,240
don't You all are giggling at this. Why

1290
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,240
are you giggling at

1291
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,240
this? What seems silly about that

1292
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,240
argument?

1293
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,079
I mean, learning Latin Greek is first of

1294
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,200
all, it seems like kind of elitist and

1295
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,000
hilarious for that reason, but also it's

1296
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,920
like any language or I guess any

1297
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,839
singular task. It's a lot of like

1298
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,839
pattern matching. I imagine I'm not a

1299
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,079
great language learner, but I can't

1300
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:44,079
imagine how you could apply the same

1301
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:46,000
underlying like if I just learned a lot

1302
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,839
of Polish, I would be really good at

1303
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
lots of other kinds of things. It

1304
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,079
doesn't doesn't stick quite well. Good.

1305
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,079
Um what are what are things in our

1306
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,920
current educational system that we tell

1307
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,280
people if you will if you learn this

1308
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,680
thing you'll be good at lots of other

1309
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,680
kinds of things?

1310
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,680
Math especially higher level stuff. Okay

1311
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,800
good. So there's there can people think

1312
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,760
of other kinds of things that have

1313
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,760
claims that are similar to that?

1314
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,200
Feel like just reading in general people

1315
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,559
claim like oh like if you can read then

1316
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,480
you can read anything and then you can

1317
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,160
learn it. Ah good. Okay. So that that

1318
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,520
there's domain independent reading

1319
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,359
skills. That's a thing that comes out

1320
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,839
there that that we can ask some more

1321
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:29,920
about. I could argue that uh like many

1322
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,800
academic stuff when not relating to

1323
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,599
academic stuff gets that claim like if

1324
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,720
you do this good academic like achieve

1325
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,599
whatever like learning you will do good

1326
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,920
at nonacademic certain task whether that

1327
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,680
be like you know normal dayto-day

1328
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,200
getting a job or something like that.

1329
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,599
Yep. Yep. Yeah. schools help you with

1330
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,880
other things. Um, chess gets this a lot.

1331
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,200
You know, learn to play chess, you get

1332
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,200
strategic thinking. Uh, if you take

1333
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,839
classes, you will be good at the job

1334
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,000
that they're teaching you. Yeah. You

1335
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:03,520
know, my my wife works on the faculty

1336
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,079
here um and uh in material science and

1337
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,160
she had somebody from who did material

1338
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,640
science in a in an engineering company

1339
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,240
once come and came to a faculty meeting

1340
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,480
and and basically was telling the

1341
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,520
faculty like how little she thought of

1342
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,800
the training that they got in in lab.

1343
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,240
She was like, "Well, I guess it's okay

1344
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,839
if you do a Europe. It's like better

1345
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,960
than doing lifeguarding for a summer or

1346
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,720
something like that, but it's really not

1347
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,640
very helpful." Which was funny at the

1348
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,160
time. But the point being that like yeah

1349
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,760
the thing like the things that people do

1350
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,119
in companies to like actually build

1351
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,480
products are quite different than the

1352
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,240
things that happen in academic research

1353
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,800
labs to imagine these kinds of things.

1354
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,359
Um all right here's here are a couple of

1355
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,720
sort of striking examples. Oh um I and

1356
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,160
I'll point out this later. I think

1357
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,359
computer programming gets this. Have any

1358
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,520
of you ever heard the phrase

1359
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,040
computational thinking? Um, so

1360
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,440
computational thinking is like roughly

1361
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,079
the claim that if you teach people how

1362
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,000
to program computers, they will have a

1363
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,839
bunch of skills that are useful in other

1364
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,599
kinds of domains. Like you'll learn how

1365
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,720
to break problems down into smaller

1366
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,240
problems. You'll learn how to think

1367
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,319
through things with algorithms and stuff

1368
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,200
like that. It is actually that line of

1369
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:07,359
argument is very similar to the argument

1370
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,760
a century plus ago or a couple centuries

1371
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,280
ago um that if you learn Latin and Greek

1372
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,559
you will have these domain independent

1373
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,839
thinking skills that are good for

1374
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,760
reasoning and other kinds of domains. Um

1375
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,520
uh here's a remarkable study that a

1376
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,880
colleague of mine did recently that sort

1377
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,480
of illustrates this. He was trying to

1378
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,319
figure out like how good are people at

1379
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,520
um

1380
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:29,839
differentiating at at sorting truth from

1381
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,440
fiction online. Um so he shows them two

1382
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,200
websites. One of them is the American

1383
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Academy of Pediatrics. The other is the

1384
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,800
American College of Pediatricians. Those

1385
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,559
sound pretty similar. The websites

1386
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,520
actually look pretty similar. Um the

1387
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,599
American Academy of Pediatrics is a

1388
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,280
40,000 member organization that

1389
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,359
represents pediatricians across the

1390
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,599
United States. Um the American College

1391
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,079
of Pediatricians is like a four, five,

1392
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,599
600 person splinter group um that split

1393
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,160
off from the American Academy of

1394
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,800
Pediatricians um in opposition to

1395
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,319
same-sex adoption. Um so like one is a

1396
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
very mainstream group, one is sort of a

1397
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,319
splinter group. Um professional fact

1398
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,800
checkers who work in newspapers and

1399
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,880
magazines and stuff like that um could

1400
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,040
identify this the difference between

1401
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,680
these websites and organizations 100% of

1402
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,920
the time. Um how well do you think

1403
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,760
historians did at this professional

1404
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,440
trained historians did at this who spend

1405
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,520
their entire lives studying how to

1406
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,559
evaluate information and how well do you

1407
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:28,240
think Stanford freshmen do at this task?

1408
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:30,480
like saying this group is not the same

1409
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,839
as this other group. Uh yeah, I mean it

1410
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,200
was slightly more detailed than I was

1411
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:37,040
like which which which which of these

1412
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,119
would have like you know better better

1413
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,119
substantiated claims but even sort of

1414
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,040
recognizing the difference between them.

1415
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,720
Um like even identifying that the

1416
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,240
American College of Pediatricians is

1417
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,640
like not the same thing as the American

1418
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,160
Academy of

1419
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,200
Pediatricians.

1420
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:56,000
Um they do shockingly shockingly poorly.

1421
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,800
Um so 50% of trained award-winning

1422
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,240
tenured historians um either wasn't sure

1423
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,839
I I think the question they ask is which

1424
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,440
of these is sort of like a more reliable

1425
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,680
source of information and the fact

1426
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,119
checkers were like yeah the academy with

1427
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,720
all the people in the mainstream group

1428
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,880
and historians about half of them did

1429
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,040
that and actually about 20% of Stanford

1430
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,280
freshmen you know people who um got into

1431
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,480
a university with a 3% acceptance rate

1432
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:22,480
or something like that um are fact

1433
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,359
checkers smarter than historians tenure

1434
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,359
historians or Stanford

1435
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:29,839
students like it like it doesn't stand

1436
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,800
to reason that they would have better um

1437
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,720
generic like domain independent thinking

1438
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,720
skills or critical thinking skills or

1439
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,119
problem solving something like that. Um

1440
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,200
a better a better way to think about it

1441
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,440
is like they must be doing something

1442
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,000
different. Um and and it turned out that

1443
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,079
when you observe them, they were um that

1444
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,240
when historians and Stanford freshmen go

1445
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,480
to a website to evaluate the website,

1446
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,559
they scroll up and down and they look on

1447
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,880
the website for markers of credibility.

1448
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,400
Um uh you know, does this like is it

1449
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,280
formatted correctly? Does it seem to be

1450
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,400
from a reputable organization? Is it

1451
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,520
aorg.com? Does it have citations? Stuff

1452
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,359
like that. The American College of

1453
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,880
Pediatricians has all of those markers

1454
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,640
of credibility. Like the like all the

1455
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,720
bad guys have lists of how to make a

1456
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,240
credible looking website. Um the fact

1457
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,000
checkers do something totally different.

1458
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,920
As soon as they go to a website, they

1459
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,280
leave it. Um so they would go to the

1460
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,960
American College of Pediatricians and

1461
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,559
they immediately just Google American

1462
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,000
College of Pediatricians in which you

1463
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,480
very quickly learn, you know, that the

1464
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,440
600 person uh splinter group and and

1465
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,920
those sorts of things. Um and so the

1466
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,280
idea you know people would like even you

1467
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,040
know the thing which is so striking here

1468
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,640
actually the reason why this research

1469
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,640
group picked this tenure group of

1470
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,800
historians is they were hoping that they

1471
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,920
would be examples of experts. It would

1472
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,119
be like they would be like these people

1473
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,800
have trained their entire lives to study

1474
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,319
information and to sort truth from

1475
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,000
fiction in historical documents. And it

1476
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,359
turns out spending your entire life

1477
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,440
learning how to sort truth from fiction

1478
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,040
in the archives doesn't help you very

1479
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,680
much. Learning how to sort truth from

1480
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,839
fiction to the internet. Um so this is

1481
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,680
one of the sort of key ideas of transfer

1482
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,960
that if you learn how to do something in

1483
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,520
one domain even changing the context of

1484
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,960
that domain not that much going from

1485
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,640
searching sorting truth for fiction in

1486
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,640
the archives is sufficiently different

1487
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,559
from sorting truth from fiction online

1488
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,160
um that there's not like a generic set

1489
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,240
of critical thinking skills that helps

1490
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,680
you bridge that. Um if you want to get

1491
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,040
if you want to get good at sorting truth

1492
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,720
from fiction online you have to learn a

1493
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,400
specific set of skills that are related

1494
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,280
to learning to sort truth from fiction

1495
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,920
online. Um here's another one of uh

1496
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,280
those examples.

1497
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,480
Um this is a classic experiment that

1498
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,800
gets replicated in various kinds of

1499
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,559
ways. In one experiment, third graders,

1500
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,079
some identified by a reading test as

1501
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,079
good readers, some as poor, were asked

1502
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,000
to read a passage about soccer. The poor

1503
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,760
readers who knew a lot about soccer were

1504
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,680
three times as likely to make accurate

1505
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,200
inferences about the passage as the good

1506
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,280
readers who didn't know much about the

1507
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,480
game. Current education practices show

1508
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,480
that reading comprehension is

1509
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,160
misunderstood. It's treated like a

1510
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,480
general skill that can be applied with

1511
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,559
equal success to all texts. Rather,

1512
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,720
comprehension is intimately intertwined

1513
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,240
with knowledge. So, we we think, you

1514
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,640
know, there's ways of measuring like are

1515
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,640
you a good reader or a bad reader. But

1516
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,079
it actually sort of sets aside the fact

1517
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,839
that like if you know a bunch of stuff

1518
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,200
about soccer, you're a good soccer

1519
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,960
reader. And if you don't know a lot of

1520
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,599
stuff about soccer, you're a bad soccer

1521
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,359
reader. Um, this is terrible for reading

1522
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,720
instruction, right? It would be much

1523
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,799
better for the world if we could just

1524
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,040
make you a good reader. But actually the

1525
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:22,559
way to be good at reading in a domain is

1526
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,240
to teach you a bunch of facts and

1527
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,640
knowledge and information in that

1528
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,720
specific domain. Um that in fact like

1529
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,119
the skill of reading doesn't transfer

1530
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,440
that well from reading about soccer to

1531
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,079
reading about softball. Um it's not that

1532
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,400
it doesn't transfer at all. Um but you

1533
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,160
know and also being able to read well

1534
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,079
about soccer is sort of more like being

1535
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,000
able to read well about soft well you

1536
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,280
know softball and less likely you know

1537
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,960
sort of less related to being able to

1538
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,400
read well about restaurants or something

1539
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,480
like that. Um

1540
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,640
uh this this is my way of making fun of

1541
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,160
the claim that computer science taught

1542
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,520
me to break down problems into pieces.

1543
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,119
This is sort of a classic kind of

1544
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,720
computational thinking argument that if

1545
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,760
you if you teach if you teach someone

1546
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,400
computer science they'll be able to

1547
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,400
break down problems into pieces. um you

1548
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,000
know like so here's an AP literature

1549
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,680
question like before using computer

1550
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,359
science I answered this with one long

1551
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,440
sentence but now I use paragraphs to

1552
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,440
break up my arguments into pieces no of

1553
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,200
course like from the very beginning of

1554
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,559
you learning how to write you were

1555
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,240
taught to break down problems into

1556
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,920
pieces like that's what writing is you

1557
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,760
break big ideas into paragraphs you

1558
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,280
break paragraphs into sentences you make

1559
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,200
sentences into phrases you've been

1560
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,240
taught forever how to break ideas down

1561
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,760
into pieces but turning you know written

1562
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,839
words into breaking them down into

1563
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,440
pieces doesn't really help you at all in

1564
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,760
taking computer programming problems and

1565
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,200
breaking them down into pieces. Um, you

1566
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,200
know, before studying computer science,

1567
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,640
I wrote one equation to solve all these

1568
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,319
problems, but now I break problems down

1569
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:48,160
into pieces. Um yeah, I could speak like

1570
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,040
a little on that and from like firsthand

1571
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,760
experience like I've done like computer

1572
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:57,200
science like problem solving very much

1573
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:00,880
since like middle school and in terms of

1574
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,559
domain knowledge like I don't when I'm

1575
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,799
encounter with a different domain I

1576
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,760
don't know where to even cut the pieces

1577
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,839
for the problem there are sure I want to

1578
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,920
do that but where I don't know what

1579
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,319
where to cut it into smaller pieces this

1580
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,640
is something I have to acquire just like

1581
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,920
anyone else. Yeah, that is the domain

1582
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,760
specific knowledge that you need to

1583
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,240
acquire in that particular domain to

1584
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,760
know what break I mean it it is probably

1585
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,599
slightly useful to have the intuition um

1586
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,880
hey bigger problems can be broken down

1587
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,240
into smaller problems like that's

1588
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,599
probably a little bit helpful in a lot

1589
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,119
of cases but I like the way that you

1590
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,640
phrase that if you don't know anything

1591
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,079
about the domain you don't know what the

1592
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,160
sort of relevant division points for

1593
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,920
breaking something into pieces are

1594
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,160
um uh that one of the first people to

1595
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,280
study this was uh Edward Thorndikeke I

1596
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,880
was just rereading meeting today one of

1597
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,559
the studies that he did which was um to

1598
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,640
uh have people be really good at

1599
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,720
estimating the size of rectangles. So he

1600
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,200
would cut rectangles on pieces of paper

1601
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,280
and have people look at rectangles,

1602
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,960
estimate their area, give them some

1603
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,160
feedback and you can actually get you

1604
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,760
know there was a hundred different

1605
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,880
rectangles of different sizes and you

1606
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,599
found pretty quickly you can get people

1607
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,000
better at estimating rectangles. Um then

1608
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:12,079
he would give them piles of circles and

1609
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,160
triangles and rhombuses and things like

1610
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,920
that and they're no better at estimating

1611
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,000
the size of circles and triangles having

1612
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,240
studied how to estimate um rectangles.

1613
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,400
Again, um there are all kinds of studies

1614
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,280
that are done like this. A lot a sort of

1615
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,040
wave recently being uh um you know,

1616
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,400
studies that disprove that there's any

1617
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,400
relationship between chess knowledge and

1618
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,839
academic outcomes between or chess

1619
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,680
proficiency and academic outcomes

1620
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:37,599
between music knowledge and academic

1621
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,280
outcomes. Um these things are sort of

1622
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,359
much more separate than we might have

1623
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,680
hoped. Uh about the reading

1624
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,880
comprehension thing. Yeah. Do the

1625
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,440
standardized tests like ACT or ACT take

1626
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,520
that into an account or they don't? It's

1627
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,000
a it's a hu it's a huge problem. Um so I

1628
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,440
mean in a sense they here's how they try

1629
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,319
to take it into account is

1630
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,240
they try to indicate to educators what

1631
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,920
are the domains of knowledge that will

1632
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,240
be sampled by the SAT um and have people

1633
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,119
read things that are related to those

1634
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:16,240
domains of knowledge. Um, one of the one

1635
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:17,599
of the knocks about particularly early

1636
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,040
standardized tests. I think standardized

1637
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,160
testing companies have done better about

1638
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,760
these kinds of things. Um, is you know

1639
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,480
there would be there would be all kinds

1640
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,079
of questions that are about like or you

1641
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,599
know where where the examples take place

1642
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,040
in a country club or something like

1643
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,000
that. Um, you know, and in 75 years or

1644
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,200
whatever, maybe it would have been

1645
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,559
pretty likely that just about everybody

1646
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,400
who's applying to college knows what a

1647
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,760
country club is. Um, but there are tons

1648
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,040
of Americans who have no idea what a

1649
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,680
country club is. Um, and so you know, if

1650
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,839
you if you treat reading as a domain

1651
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,119
independent entity where everybody

1652
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,640
should be able to like recognize the

1653
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,920
words country club and then process the

1654
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,440
rest of the sentence, then that seems

1655
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,920
fair. But it is the more you realize

1656
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,839
like no, knowing something about a

1657
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,920
country club gives you an advantage on

1658
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:02,079
questions that are about country clubs.

1659
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,280
Um, then you know, and I think we could

1660
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,720
all agree that like knowing about

1661
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,920
country clubs is not something that's

1662
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,920
particularly important to going to

1663
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,799
college or advancing higher education or

1664
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,880
other things like that. then you're

1665
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,960
like, "Oh, that is kind of unfair." Um,

1666
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,640
so I think there's more recognition of

1667
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,880
those things over time. Of course, you

1668
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,839
have the opposite problem, which is that

1669
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,880
the more you tell people exactly what

1670
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:25,520
the domains are that might be tested,

1671
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,599
um, the more you have people like just

1672
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,520
studying and practicing those domains.

1673
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,839
And that's not like exactly the point of

1674
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,079
these testing systems either. Um,

1675
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,599
ideally, ideally, they would sort of

1676
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,520
give us some kind of indication of

1677
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,880
people's proficiency like in a wide

1678
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,319
range of things that might help them be

1679
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,920
good at college, but it's a it's a real

1680
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,720
problem.

1681
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,040
I've heard that like SAT kind of changed

1682
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,760
their argument a little bit or like the

1683
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:53,040
way they phrase it into like it's not

1684
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,880
that the test matters at all. They like

1685
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:59,200
the argument now like is more leaning

1686
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:02,319
towards like their performance on the

1687
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,559
test indicates the students ability to

1688
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:07,200
prepare for the test. Even though the

1689
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,160
test is meaningless, the ability to

1690
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,640
prepare for the test is what's being

1691
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:16,079
tested. And that's correlated well with

1692
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:20,079
other kind of things which is not like

1693
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,920
completely outrageous to say like like I

1694
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,960
give you like a completely stupid

1695
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,640
subject no one heard of and tell you to

1696
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,440
prepare for it. The people who better

1697
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,960
prepare for it are probably better

1698
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,960
studyers who will perform better at

1699
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,960
college where you will also do kind of

1700
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,880
that study but it's not perfect and it

1701
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,119
will lead to like disproportionate

1702
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,720
outcomes when like these people who do

1703
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:49,280
not fit into the ne like nice like line

1704
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,880
where the like standard fats go. I I

1705
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,839
think that's right. I think the I think

1706
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,640
an early early rhetoric of testing would

1707
01:02:53,839 --> 01:03:00,559
have been something along the lines of

1708
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:03,119
like intelligence is uh is a is a

1709
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,599
universal human quality. We can design

1710
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,799
tests that's not culturally specific. We

1711
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,559
can design tests that measure

1712
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,079
intelligence and using these accurate

1713
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,160
tests that me measure intelligence, we

1714
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,760
can find the most intelligent people um

1715
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,200
and then we can send them into college.

1716
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,880
As soon as you recognize that some

1717
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,039
degree of intelligence tests are

1718
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,319
culturally biased because of all these

1719
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,359
sort of transfer problems that we've

1720
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,480
just been talking about um that uh you

1721
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:28,559
know um if you if you have a bunch of

1722
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,880
questions you know about ranching um

1723
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,480
then you then you benefit uh you know

1724
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,760
young people who are in rural states

1725
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,799
where there's a lot of ranching going on

1726
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,000
but like you know what does that have

1727
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,319
you know that's sort of the equivalent

1728
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,760
of the country club kind of thing. Um

1729
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,319
and then the you know the other argument

1730
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,079
for them is that uh they are pretty

1731
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,760
good. You know there are correlations

1732
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,440
between people's success on these tests

1733
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,440
and their later success in college. It's

1734
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,720
not a perfect correlation. Um but it is

1735
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,480
one indicator that you you know if

1736
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,760
someone is struggling to do well on

1737
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,119
these tests. There's good there's

1738
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,640
reasonable reasons to believe that they

1739
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,119
might struggle to do well in college

1740
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,319
settings and so forth. Um anyway, you

1741
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,760
can imagine t you know um unraveling

1742
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:06,640
this kind of question has huge

1743
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,880
implications for how valuable it is for

1744
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,640
kids to spend zillions of hours on

1745
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,240
Minecraft. So when kids play when kids

1746
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,039
play zillions of hours on Minecraft,

1747
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:18,079
they learn a ton. Um you know, they

1748
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:20,160
learn um uh how to collaborate with

1749
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,520
other people. They learn how to find

1750
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,280
information on the internet. You know,

1751
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,520
the the Minecraft, a little bit like the

1752
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,920
logical journey of the Zooinis, has no

1753
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,920
instructions on the screen. Um, you have

1754
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,520
to go to wikis, you have to watch

1755
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,200
playthrough videos, you have to do other

1756
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,520
kinds of exercises to like figure out

1757
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,440
how to engage in Minecraft. And some of

1758
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,039
those things seem like domain

1759
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,559
independent sorts of skills, you know,

1760
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,799
how to find information from other

1761
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:45,119
places, how to set goals, how to pursue

1762
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:47,520
those goals, um, other kinds of things

1763
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,119
like that. Um but a but an enormous

1764
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,359
question about the value of playing

1765
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,599
games like that is something like well

1766
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,599
um like if you know how to do all that

1767
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,760
in Minecraft, does it help you do that

1768
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,000
somewhere else? Um there's a lot of

1769
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,960
educational psychology research that

1770
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,640
suggests that transfer is really hard um

1771
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,760
that when you learn things in one

1772
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,640
domain, people are not that good um at

1773
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,799
uh at passing it to another domain. Um

1774
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:15,119
to me there are sort of two contrary

1775
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,720
arguments to that. Um, this is sort of a

1776
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,559
joking way of putting it, but like I

1777
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,480
think one of the best arguments against

1778
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,000
humans ability, one of the best

1779
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,319
arguments in favor of humans ability to

1780
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,400
transfer learning is civilization. Um,

1781
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:28,319
like it's pretty hard to imagine how you

1782
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,599
would develop civilization if pretty

1783
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,960
people weren't pretty good at like

1784
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,079
learning some things and then applying

1785
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,920
them to new kinds of tasks. Um, uh, so

1786
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,520
so a sort of a theme of counterargument

1787
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,000
is that basically like educational

1788
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,559
researchers are not good at detecting

1789
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,880
and observing transfer. We're not good

1790
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,480
at at conducting studies that measure

1791
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,880
people's abilities to take things from

1792
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,559
one domain um and put them to another

1793
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,640
domain. If you listen to that podcast

1794
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,039
episode with Constance Steiner, who's a

1795
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,720
huge advocate of uh the benefits of

1796
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,319
games for learning, you'll hear her make

1797
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,640
an argument sort of along those lines,

1798
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:02,400
which is like, come on, Justin, like if

1799
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,079
you get really good at doing cool stuff

1800
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,280
in Minecraft, like that will help you

1801
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,720
with other things that you're doing in

1802
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,240
life. Not that different from what Dana

1803
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,599
said at the beginning of the class about

1804
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,359
the things you learn playing in the

1805
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,880
resistance, you know? Like I can learn

1806
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,240
how, you know, I learned how to keep a

1807
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,920
poker face there and now I can keep a

1808
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,680
poker face in other kinds of places. Um,

1809
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:23,440
so unanswered questions to be sure.

1810
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,680
Good. Um, 2:25, you all should have a

1811
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,880
wonderful spring break. Um, you should

1812
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,160
come, there's a little bit of reading

1813
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,920
that you have to do, but mostly you

1814
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,119
should come with a draft. Um, the

1815
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,119
strongest draft that you can put

1816
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,480
together for paper two on Monday. Um, a

1817
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,400
week from Monday, and we'll have a

1818
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,240
chance to do some peer editing in that

1819
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,400
class. Um, and we're going to sort of

1820
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,799
shift from genres of learning at scale

1821
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:47,000
to the as yet intractable dilemmas in

1822
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,000
the second half of failure to disrupt.
