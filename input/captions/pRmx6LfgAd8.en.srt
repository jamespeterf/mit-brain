1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,170
Hello, and welcome.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,070
I'm Martha Broad.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,250
I'm the Executive Director
of the MIT Energy Initiative.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,540
And we are really happy
to have everyone here.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,650
We're going to have
an amazing lineup.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,060
We have a two-part
presentation tonight.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,950
And we're going to start out
with this report and the authors

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,970
who are going to share with us
where we are with fusion energy.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,360
And they've spent a
good amount of time

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,110
over the past year or
two working on this.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,220
Then, we will follow
that with presentations

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,500
from the Plasma Science
and Fusion Center

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,940
faculty and researchers about
their exciting current research

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,810
into this promising technology.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,870
And to get us started,
it is my pleasure

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,510
to introduce MIT
Professor Anne White.

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,140
She is the Vice Provost
and Associate Vice

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,690
President of Research
and Administration

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,269
and the School of Engineering
Distinguished Professor

21
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,040
of Engineering at MIT.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,234
Welcome, Anne.

23
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:13,210
[APPLAUSE]

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,700

25
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,500
Well, thank you, Martha, for
the kind, kind introduction.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,235
And thank you all
for being here.

27
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:21,610
It's a real pleasure
to have been

28
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,400
asked to say just a
few words and offer you

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,650
a brief introduction to the
potential of harnessing fusion

30
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,100
energy.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,920
Fusion energy is an extremely
attractive energy source.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,120
It's abundant.

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,260
It's clean.

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,950
It's safe.

35
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,570
We're going to combine light
nuclei to form heavier nuclei,

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,590
releasing energy according
to Einstein's famous formula,

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,670
E equals MC squared.

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,890
Now, we're going to do this
with some hydrogen isotopes,

39
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,390
deuterium and tritium.

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,420
We're also going to need some
lithium in our fuel cycle,

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,640
at least in the most likely
near-term fuel cycle.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,320
And thankfully, the
deuterium and lithium

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,820
are pretty available.

44
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,560
And the tritium can be produced.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,520
So fusion power plants will
not produce any carbon dioxide

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,390
directly, no direct
greenhouse gases.

47
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,530
Fusion is also inherently safe.

48
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,070
There are minimal proliferation
risks, minimal land and water

49
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,500
use, and no energy
storage issue.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,260
So is this sounding
too good to be true?

51
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,610
Yeah.

52
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,750
Thankfully, it's not.

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,400
The great news is,
fusion on the grid

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
is a lot closer than you think.

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,400
And I'm not going to steal
the next speaker, Professor

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,190
Armstrong's thunder,
telling you why

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,040
now is the moment for fusion.

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,100
But I will just reiterate--

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,620
the potential and the
promise of fusion energy

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,960
to completely
transform our approach

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,840
to climate change,
mitigation, and adaptation

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,750
is really tremendous.

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,140
And that promise means that
getting fusion on the grid

64
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,350
is both an intellectual and
scientific grand challenge,

65
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,790
and also a true
societal call to action.

66
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,175
And in that sense, the work that
MIT has done on fusion, for many

67
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,550
of the speakers
that you're going

68
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,520
to hear from today and also
many others who are not here

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,460
in the room today, represents
the kind of ambitious impact

70
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,910
and solutions-oriented
work and collaboration

71
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,710
with external
stakeholders that will

72
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,830
be the focus of the new
climate project at MIT.

73
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,550
And MIT is a special place,
both for Fusion energy research

74
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,920
and climate action.

75
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,420
MIT has that special
sauce of entrepreneurship,

76
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,880
including in the
areas of deep tech.

77
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,470
We have a culture
of problem solving,

78
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,030
of always trying to lower
the barriers to collaboration

79
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,480
across disciplines,
and a history, also,

80
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,840
of mobilizing very large
sections of our MIT community

81
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,880
around these hard problems--

82
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,350
and not just
ourselves on campus--

83
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,410
but, of course, we
have the breadth

84
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,090
of our partnerships
as a strength

85
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,709
as well, working with
cities, with states,

86
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,640
with communities in the area
of climate and infrastructure

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,320
planning and policy.

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,360
And we work with
national governments

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,990
on developing, testing, and
evaluation of new policy tools.

90
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,440
This diversity of partners is
essential for making progress

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,250
on the climate challenge.

92
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,890
And we, of course, also
have a global reach

93
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,140
and a global network as well,
working with other universities,

94
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,090
governments, companies and
nonprofits around the world,

95
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,990
especially in places who
need climate solutions now

96
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,640
more than ever, not tomorrow.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,580
So I truly hope that you enjoy
this very exciting event,

98
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,390
learning more about the
transformational potential

99
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,830
of fusion energy.

100
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,520
And you're really in for
a treat because you're

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,210
going to be hearing from some
of the absolute top researchers

102
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,140
in this field, and also some of
the most wonderful folks I know

103
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,630
and have the pleasure of working
with at the Plasma Science

104
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,120
and Fusion Center here at MIT.

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,090
So thanks very much.

106
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,330
And I'll turn it over
to Professor Armstrong.

107
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,690
[APPLAUSE]

108
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,010

109
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,420
Thank you very much,
Professor White.

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,990
So in this study, as
Professor White mentioned,

111
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,030
MIT is a great place
for collaboration

112
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,670
across disciplinary boundaries.

113
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,290
The study that
we're going to dive

114
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,190
into here in the first
half of this program

115
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,640
brought together some
30 different researchers

116
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,310
from many different
disciplines, ranging

117
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,320
from nuclear science
and engineering,

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,230
to economics, to policy.

119
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,320
And I think that interaction
is typical of studies

120
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,690
we've done at MITEI in
other parts of campus,

121
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,290
where those different
perspectives are just

122
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,280
essential to develop the
kind of insights we're after

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,820
and how to move forward
as fast as we can.

124
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,030
As Professor White mentioned,
fusion has long captured

125
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,640
the imaginations of many who
are interested in 0-carbon

126
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,870
or emissions-free energy.

127
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,540
With more than 40 startups today
and more than 100 government

128
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,840
projects in the
fusion area, there's

129
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,640
never been as much momentum
and enthusiasm for the role

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,560
that fusion might play in
the future energy systems.

131
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,460
Two characteristics make
fusion particularly well suited

132
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,280
for the future energy system.

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,830
One is that you get
carbon-free, firm power.

134
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,480
By "firm," I mean that
whenever you need the power,

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,820
it's there in the
amounts that you need.

136
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,720
That's not only essential
for future energy systems,

137
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,760
it's not easy to find
carbon-free or emissions-free

138
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,090
firm energy sources.

139
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,100
Nuclear fission is another
contender in that space.

140
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,580
There are some other contenders
that aren't demonstrated yet.

141
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,940
But fusion is one that's
particularly attractive

142
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,050
because in addition to the
characteristics of firm

143
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,300
power, zero emissions, it's
also energy dense and scalable.

144
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,070
So it has the potential to
transform this system globally

145
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,320
as we move to a net-zero
emissions future.

146
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,980
So this is the time
to understand just

147
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,510
how fusion could impact
future energy systems,

148
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,540
what the scale of
that impact could be,

149
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,370
and how it might
play out globally.

150
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,133
And that's what we
look at in this study.

151
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:13,410
Among other things that
we looked at in the study,

152
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,510
we looked at how fusion will
compliment and coexist with

153
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,150
other low-carbon technologies--

154
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,250
intermittent technologies, like
solar and wind; a deployment

155
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,660
scale and global distribution
of fusion as we move forward;

156
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,740
a sensitivity of fusion's
penetration to the system

157
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,720
to cost; a sensitivity
to emissions constraints

158
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,710
as governments start
to ratchet down

159
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,250
the allowed emissions
in our economy;

160
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,210
sensitivity to renewable
resources, regionally,

161
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,840
around the world; and
critical materials and supply

162
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,850
chains for implementing
fusion at large scale.

163
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,440
So not only can
this understanding

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,470
be helpful for strategic
planners and policymakers,

165
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,380
but also for those involved
in fusion commercialization

166
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,820
because the study
set allows us to look

167
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,810
at economic targets for the
use of fusion and electricity

168
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,770
markets.

169
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,980
So this helps better
quantify for developers

170
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,840
of fusion technology,
people doing

171
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,100
cutting edge research, what
the target pricing needs to be,

172
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,370
what availability, and what
load following these fusion

173
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,110
plants in the future need
to be able to achieve.

174
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,320
So to dive into the study, I'd
like to turn the program over

175
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,600
to Randy Field.

176
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,950
He is the Director
of Research at MITEI.

177
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,610
And he also was
Executive Director

178
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,840
of this study, which
means he is largely

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,550
responsible for the great
results that you see here.

180
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,386
Randy?

181
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:03,338
[APPLAUSE]

182
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:08,760

183
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,260
Thank you very much, Professor
Armstrong and Professor White.

184
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,270
And I'd like to
thank all of you here

185
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,780
today who are attending
this MIT event.

186
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,580
Before I discuss the
fusion study itself,

187
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,860
I will take the opportunity to
give you a very basic overview

188
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,340
of fusion.

189
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,030
As Professor White
said, basically, fusion

190
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,030
is the fusing of two nuclei.

191
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,760
And in doing so, you
produce a tremendous amount

192
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,660
of energy, well over a million
times the amount of energy

193
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,350
from burning a fossil fuel.

194
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,200
And as already stated by both
Professor White and Professor

195
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,810
Armstrong, the beauty
of fusion energy

196
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,620
it does not generate
greenhouse gases.

197
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,126
It has a very high
energy density,

198
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:03,220
a very small amount of land
required for such a power plant.

199
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,160
And yet, to enable fusion
to be deployed at scale,

200
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,870
we have to have a
means by which we

201
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,940
can produce the very
high temperatures

202
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,830
and bring the fuels, the fusion
fuel together in confinement

203
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,690
in order to allow
them to fuse together.

204
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,370
And there are various categories
of confinement technology.

205
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,140
One method is known as
"magnetic confinement,"

206
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:39,870
where you use very strong
magnetic fields to enable

207
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:47,970
the fuel ions to be confined and
to be in close contact with each

208
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,340
other and away from the
walls of the reactor.

209
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,170
Another method is called
"inertial confinement,"

210
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,980
where you use lasers or
projectiles to rapidly compress

211
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,410
a fuel capsule in order to
achieve very high temperatures

212
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,410
in confinement.

213
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,750
And the third method for--

214
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,660
the third category
for confinement

215
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,460
is known as magneto-inertial
confinement,

216
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,890
which is really a combination
of the two prior methods.

217
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,790
These confinement methods have
been successfully demonstrated

218
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,960
in experiments.

219
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,070
And fusion has been achieved.

220
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,880
However, the challenge is really
in the engineering, the material

221
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,250
science, and in the economics.

222
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,700
Commercial success
of fusion requires

223
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,050
that we build an
economically-viable device

224
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,180
to handle the very
high temperatures

225
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,040
and the high-energy particles
that are released by fusion,

226
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,700
and also have the ability to
convert the released energy

227
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,540
into electricity.

228
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,780
Each fuel type and
each confinement method

229
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,680
has its own set of
engineering challenges

230
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,196
and innovative solutions.

231
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:12,220

232
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,880
As Professor Armstrong stated,
given the great potential

233
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,080
of fusion, it deserves
a close examination

234
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,970
to understand how fusion power
could transform the electricity

235
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,720
generation systems
in the decades ahead.

236
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,970
We started this project
in the fall of 2022.

237
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,570
And we organized the analysis
along four major work streams.

238
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,880
One of those examining
the global deployment

239
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,000
of fusion power plants in
all regions of the world

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,510
out to the end of the century.

241
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,140
And the second workstream was
examining the subregional grid

242
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,690
scale at the grid
scale to understand

243
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,860
how fusion would fit in
with the generation mix

244
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,110
when there are different
types of resources

245
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,300
available in different
parts of the regions.

246
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,720
We also assessed what
the critical materials

247
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,300
are in manufactured
components that

248
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,190
are needed to enable the build
out of the fusion power plant

249
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,770
fleet and to understand
what the bottlenecks could

250
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,130
be in that build out.

251
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,470
And lastly, we took a close look
at the cost drivers for a fusion

252
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,680
power plant to understand
what those cost drivers are

253
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,850
and how they could be addressed.

254
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,180
I also want to point out this
study is intentionally not

255
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,780
making predictions about
when fusion will be deployed

256
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,470
at a commercial scale.

257
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,990
And we're not identifying which
fusion technology will be first

258
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,710
or what it will cost.

259
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,270
But we are instead conducting
a scenario analysis

260
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,970
and a sensitivity
analysis to understand

261
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,440
the conditions at which fusion
can be deployed at scale

262
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,230
and commercially successful.

263
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,870
So with that introduction,
I'd like to now move on

264
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,360
to the key findings
of the study,

265
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,660
with presentations by
different members of the team.

266
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,090
I'll be starting with
Sergey Paltsev, who

267
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,280
led the Global Analysis
Workstream for the Study.

268
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,370
And Sergey is an economist.

269
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,310
And he's the Deputy
Director of the MIT

270
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,560
Center for Sustainability,
Science, and Strategy.

271
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,740
And he's also a senior
research scientist

272
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,185
at the MIT Energy Initiative.

273
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:37,538
[APPLAUSE]

274
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:41,370

275
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,720
Thank you, Randy.

276
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,200
Well, one thing
which at least I've

277
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,540
learned from this
particular study

278
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,730
is be careful what you wish for.

279
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,680
And let me explain why.

280
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,640
So several years
ago, I was in one

281
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,660
of the wonderful MIT conferences
in wonderful Madrid, Spain.

282
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,680
And I was presenting what we
typically do, energy scenarios.

283
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,930
What are the transition risks?

284
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,190
What are the physical risks?

285
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,740
So we have this big
economy-wide tool which

286
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,160
covers all global regions.

287
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,710
So I'm doing my typical story.

288
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,050
And the second speaker on that
conference was Dennis Whyte.

289
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:29,070
And he has done very
exciting speech about fusion.

290
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,540
And well, I was a
little bit skeptical.

291
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,690
But I saw that the
public was sold.

292
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,040
I was like, wow.

293
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,260
But in most scenarios,
we don't really

294
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,890
have any fusion represented.

295
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,900
If you are going to take a look
into any International Energy

296
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,090
Outlook or, well,
any other outlooks

297
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,790
which are trying to
project where we are going,

298
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,600
you're not going to see any
fusion in all these outlooks all

299
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,060
the way to 2100.

300
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,560
So I thought, oh, that
would be a great study.

301
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,670
That would be a great addition
to what we do in order

302
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,210
to understand how fusion is
going to fit all these things.

303
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,960
And about half a year
later, completely unrelated,

304
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,930
Randy showed up at
my office and said,

305
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,940
we are thinking about
doing a fusion study,

306
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,329
so why don't you
try and see what's

307
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,240
the story in terms of the
economics of the fusion?

308
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,680
And well, here are the results.

309
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,990
And here were kind of my
previous electrical engineering

310
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,660
training.

311
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,390
So by my first degree, I'm
an electrical engineer.

312
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,520
But then I switched to what
I typically joke as the "dark

313
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,020
side."

314
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,060
So I got my PhD in economics.

315
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,890
And as you are very
well aware, economists

316
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,280
are quite skeptical people.

317
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,260
So you probably
even have a term.

318
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,830
Economics is a dismal science.

319
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,170
So we're always skeptical
about something.

320
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,680
And so this is where
I came to the study

321
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,540
where I was a
little bit skeptical

322
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,240
because the first
question which I had,

323
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,250
why do we need fusion, right?

324
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,310
So with all the
electrification, with all wind

325
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,820
and solar and other things--

326
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,210
and by 2050, we are going
to be at net zero anyway--

327
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,650
why we need this
expensive technology

328
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,210
and why do we need
to bring that?

329
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,480
And well, I put
that into our model.

330
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,490
And we get some of the results,
well, which were, in the end,

331
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,690
not that surprising, but
kind of taught us again

332
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,490
that, well, whatever
the story, we

333
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,280
need to make sure that
everything adds up

334
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,920
in terms of all the components.

335
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,620
And as Professor White and
Professor Armstrong and Randy

336
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,730
Field already
mentioned, we had a lot

337
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,320
of opportunities from fusion,
but a lot of challenges

338
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,020
on the technology side.

339
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,350
And the point which we are
trying to make-- at least, well,

340
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,700
my part of the study--

341
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,090
is trying to understand what
are the economic opportunities

342
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,320
and economic challenges?

343
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,880
And so these two simple
curves is an attempt

344
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,900
to understand, well,
what's the value?

345
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,310
What's the value of society?

346
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,490
What's the value for
the society if we are

347
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,090
going to develop the fusion?

348
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,630
And we have done a
very simple experiment

349
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,880
where we, first of all, run the
scenarios where we are achieving

350
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,570
the Paris Agreement goals.

351
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,330
So kind of on a
separate activities,

352
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,450
we have our MIT
global change outlook

353
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,770
where we are developing
different pathways,

354
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,360
how to get to 1.5 and
the different regimes

355
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,770
with overshoot, without
overshoot, and so on.

356
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,040
So in all of these scenarios
in this particular study,

357
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,200
we are achieving 1.5 goal.

358
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,410
And then, what we
have done, we tried

359
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,230
to understand what kind
of information, what kind

360
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,040
of signpost we can give to
the technology developers

361
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,320
in terms of the cost
performance of this technology.

362
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,880
In other words, well,
how cheap, how much you

363
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,110
need to reduce the cost
of overnight capital cost

364
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,280
or overall cost in order to
make sure that economically,

365
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,460
it makes sense.

366
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,910
It means that we didn't force
any particular technology,

367
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,920
but we have done the
emission reduction scenario

368
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,440
and technologies are competing
based on the economics.

369
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,720
So we are not
forcing the fusion.

370
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,400
We are trying to find what
are the conditions where

371
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
the technology is making
the economic sense?

372
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,580
And so these
particular two curves

373
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,490
shows you the value for the
global society between two cases

374
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,660
where fusion were
never invented versus

375
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,650
where the cost of the fusion.

376
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,000
And you're going to see
this abbreviation in terms

377
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,820
of the overnight capital cost.

378
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,050
Well, these are the
numbers for 2050.

379
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,690
So it means that,
kind of initially,

380
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,920
it starts much higher.

381
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,250
And then it's going lower.

382
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,520
So in the report,
there are actually

383
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,560
trajectories, what we project
in terms of the costs.

384
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,190
But what we have done is try to
understand what is the value.

385
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,030
And you see, well, those
are nontrivial numbers.

386
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,760
And you can actually aggregate
those numbers and compare.

387
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,870
And it turns out that, well,
under this condition where

388
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:17,200
the overnight cost is about
$8,000 per kilowatt, then, well,

389
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,010
if you're going to compare
the cumulative GDPs with

390
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,210
and without, you are
actually gaining about 0.4%,

391
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,500
0.5% of the global GDP.

392
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,330
And if you are reducing
cost even more,

393
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,520
you are gaining about close
to 1% of the global GDP.

394
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,450
So while that comes as
an additional benefit--

395
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,600
so you are still meeting
the same reduction.

396
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,820
You are still meeting
the same target.

397
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,140
But you are actually
helping the society

398
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,450
to reach the target
if indeed you

399
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,960
are going to reach this quite
aggressive goal in terms

400
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,550
of the reduction in the
cost of this technology.

401
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,450
So we also have looked
at, well, how much?

402
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,770
What's the contribution
in terms of the share?

403
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,880
And you see that while we run
different scenarios and kind

404
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,810
of while we run actually
many more scenarios,

405
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,310
but focusing on this, depending
on the different costs,

406
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,770
take a look at that top color.

407
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,640
I'm not sure.

408
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,380
On my slide, it's like
magenta over there.

409
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,830
It's something else,
but see that top color.

410
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,520
And the point is,
well, you still

411
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,610
see that color under different
assumptions about the capital

412
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,290
cost and the numbers
that it gives you

413
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,760
the global share between
10% and almost half

414
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,220
of the electricity, which
are coming from the fusion.

415
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,970
And while there are two
main drivers behind that--

416
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,060
well, one, as you can
see from these figures,

417
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,590
the world needs more
and more electricity.

418
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,670
And so the huge driver
is electrification.

419
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,440
And by the time where you
start exhausting the resources

420
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,650
for wind and solar,
and then by the time

421
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,010
where the cost of integration
of intermittent renewables,

422
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,870
intermittent sources getting
harder and harder to manage--

423
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,850
well, this is where the
story for fusion comes.

424
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,520
And so this is
actually the story

425
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,520
for any carbon-free
dispatchable technology.

426
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,170
As long as you can invent--

427
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,930
well, you can label fusion,
you can label whatever else.

428
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,000
So that's the value of something
which you are going to create

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,480
and you can deliver and
put into the system.

430
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,110
And obviously, well,
there are a lot

431
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,000
of things which are going
to affect these numbers.

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,940
And again, we try to
understand some of them.

433
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,750
And you can see,
well, kind of a lot

434
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,340
is going to depend
on, well, if we

435
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,330
are going to create almost
free storage of energy, well,

436
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,580
then it will go into
different solution.

437
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,590
Well, that's another
kind of big "if."

438
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,730
But there are certain
things which obviously is

439
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,600
going to affect the trajectory.

440
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,830
But also, you can
see that the need--

441
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,320
initially, see we see the jump
in fusion kind of by midcentury

442
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,680
in the US and Europe mostly.

443
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,820
But by the end of this
century, where Africa demands

444
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,090
much more energy, where all this
electrification is happening

445
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,870
in India and other places--

446
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,360
this is where we see the uptake,
the need for that technology.

447
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,930
And another point is,
well, obviously this

448
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:29,040
is very aggregate
look at the problem.

449
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,200
And so later on, you
will see a little bit

450
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,590
more detailed exploration.

451
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,380
And again, in the
report, we are doing

452
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,030
much more detailed exploration.

453
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,100
And even that
detailed exploration

454
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,120
is kind of not representing
all the challenges and all

455
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,730
the things which are going
to affect the development

456
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,940
of this technology.

457
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,840
And so the exact
numbers, obviously, you

458
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,660
need to take that with
very big degree of caution.

459
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,340
But the trajectory is simple.

460
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,510
So with all these
uncertainties, one message

461
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,660
becomes very, very clear.

462
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,760
Well, with
appropriate resolution

463
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,570
of technological issues,
with appropriate resolution

464
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,540
of regulatory issues
which are going

465
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,740
to be needed to support
this technology,

466
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,800
we will have a big impact.

467
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,070
And that is going
to help our society

468
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,210
to reach the aggressive
climate goals at cheaper

469
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,250
cost to the society
in comparison

470
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,630
if we would not really
spend our effort right now.

471
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,070
But in order to deliver
that by midcentury,

472
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,530
well, we need to start doing
this planning, this R&D,

473
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,270
this story right now.

474
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,480
And that's exactly what we
are going to hear later on.

475
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,820
That's exactly what MIT
is leading the world.

476
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,630
And I can tell--

477
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,390
well, I kind of recently
traveled in all places,

478
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,150
Australia, Brazil, Barcelona.

479
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,840
And while they all
asking, guys, you're

480
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,300
at MIT, well, how are
you going to create

481
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,300
that wonderful technology which
is going to save the world?

482
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,670
And, well, so far,
the secret sauce

483
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,370
is coming from this technology.

484
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,310
And we will see if that's
going to be delivered.

485
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:15,720
So you see that, after all, I'm
not that skeptical economist.

486
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,280
But at least I've
been sold by Dennis.

487
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,180
So now I'm going to switch
to, I'm not sure who.

488
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,255
But Randy will choreograph that.

489
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:28,650
[APPLAUSE]

490
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,600

491
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,855
Thank you very much, Sergey.

492
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:36,580

493
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,690
Amanda Farnsworth recently
graduated from MIT

494
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,320
with her PhD in
chemical engineering.

495
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,450
And she was a key contributor
to the subregional grid analysis

496
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,200
workstream for this study.

497
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,990
Unfortunately, she can't
join us here tonight.

498
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,460
So I'll be presenting
her a piece of this work.

499
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,700
In this analysis, we basically
looked at different regions

500
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,050
of the United States,
nine different regions,

501
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,440
based on how the grid is
organized in the United States.

502
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,690
And asked the question of
how fusion would penetrate

503
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,940
those markets
differently, and analyzed

504
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,550
how that relates to
the resources they have

505
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,350
in each of those subregions.

506
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:28,000
And if we start on the far left
column, we see that two regions,

507
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,310
the so-called Atlantic and
Southeast region of the United

508
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,840
States--

509
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,480
they had the greatest
penetration of fusion,

510
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,490
basically at a price point
of $6,000 per kilowatt.

511
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,560
Fusion would be deployed
regardless of the carbon cap

512
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,840
being between 1 and 50
grams per kilowatt hour.

513
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,410
And let me just give you a
reference point for that.

514
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,620
So recently, the US average
grid carbon intensity

515
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,010
was about 450 grams
per kilowatt hour.

516
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,310
So we're talking about
deep decarbonization.

517
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,550
And what this means
is as you force

518
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,290
the grid to have lower and
lower carbon intensity,

519
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,370
it forces you to look at
what are my least cost,

520
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,010
least carbon intensive
technologies to do that.

521
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,460
And so the more you press
down on the decarbonization,

522
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,580
the more you need
the renewables.

523
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,750
And the more you need
things such as fusion.

524
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,690
And so is what we see here is
that in the North, or rather

525
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,360
in the Atlantic and
Southeast region,

526
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,790
because of the nature of
their current resources,

527
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,420
that's where you had the
highest penetration of fusion.

528
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,160
And we examined the
specific characteristics.

529
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,850
One is that those regions
have fairly poor onshore wind

530
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,260
resources.

531
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,680
They have very little hydro
and very little geothermal

532
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,480
resources.

533
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,540
They, of course, have solar.

534
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,140
But solar has the
characteristic of being

535
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,280
diurnal in its
resource, meaning you'll

536
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,110
have great resources during
the day and very poor resources

537
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,610
at night.

538
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,790
So there's a great demand for
firm power, such as fusion.

539
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,390
And that's one of the
reasons why we saw highest

540
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,050
penetration in that region.

541
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,530
That contrasts quite a bit
with the far-right column

542
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,300
where we look at Central,
North Central, and Texas,

543
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,720
where you have not only
solar, but you also

544
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,870
have abundant high quality,
low cost onshore wind,

545
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,820
which gives you a better
diversification in lower cost

546
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,030
resources.

547
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,970
And so what you see in
that case is that you only

548
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:54,840
have penetration of fusion
if your carbon constraint is

549
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,610
4 grams of CO2 per
kilowatt or less.

550
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,820
Now, it's interesting that even
though it has a penetration only

551
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,430
at the lowest levels,
if you push it down

552
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,770
to 1 gram per kilowatt
hour, even in that case,

553
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:15,120
you can have situations of 25%
to 45% penetration of fusion

554
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,730
in the market.

555
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,650
So again, it says there's a very
high sensitivity to the carbon

556
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,760
constraint, but
those regions do take

557
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,720
on fusion in those situations.

558
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,980
And I'll contrast that with the
Northwest, where, in that case,

559
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,820
you have a great diversity
of renewable energy,

560
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,930
including you've got wind
resources that are, say,

561
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,680
average.

562
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,960
But you have excellent
diversity of resources,

563
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,290
including the hydro and
geothermal in those regions.

564
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,510
And so what you see there is
a relatively low sensitivity

565
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,000
to the carbon cap.

566
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,960
But the penetration never
gets above 26% in that region.

567
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,750
So that's just a
snapshot of the work

568
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,660
that Amanda and colleagues
did for that cross analysis

569
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,910
between the different
subregions in the United States.

570
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,270
But what it really points out
is even in a single country,

571
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,000
depending upon the
region you're in,

572
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,860
you can have tremendously
different resources.

573
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,130
And those resources
can drastically

574
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,540
impact the deployment of fusion.

575
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,260
And with that, I will
now turn it over to--

576
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,490
I'll now introduce
Rory MacDonald,

577
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,330
who received his PhD in Nuclear
Science and engineering at MIT.

578
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,860
And he is a research scientist
at the MIT Energy Initiative.

579
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,720
And he worked on the subregional
grid analysis of this project.

580
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,660
And he zoomed in on the
potential role of fusion

581
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,264
in the New England area
of the United States.

582
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:54,603
[APPLAUSE]

583
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:58,910

584
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,320
Thanks very much, Randy.

585
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,060
So we studied
fusion's future role

586
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,230
in the New England grid in 2050
using a GenX model of ISO New

587
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,840
England and Quebec
hydro's resources

588
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,210
at three different
emission intensity limits.

589
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,670
This is a region with
relatively limited land

590
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,860
for onshore wind and solar PV.

591
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,410
And so other clean and
low-emission resources

592
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,140
have an important role to play
in meeting increasing demand.

593
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,560
And this analysis
modeled the fusion plants

594
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,830
in a bit more detail and added
more constraints to the grid.

595
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:32,210
So as well as looking at 20
years of correlated demand

596
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,960
and weather data,
these three plots

597
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,380
show the fusion fleet
installed capacity generation

598
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,500
and annual capacity factors as a
function of the plant investment

599
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,780
costs.

600
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,240
The left plot shows
how the fusion fleet

601
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,460
rose as the costs come down.

602
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,550
And the different segments
correspond to substitution

603
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,780
for different alternatives or
combinations of alternatives.

604
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,420
The ISO New England peak
load in these scenarios

605
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,630
was about 60 gigawatts.

606
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,050
So that 50% highest value
corresponds to about

607
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,480
a 30-gigawatt fleet.

608
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,250
The rightmost
point of each curve

609
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,710
is the capital cost at
which the first fusion

610
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,722
plant enters the grid.

611
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:09,680
So this can be thought
of essentially as a cost

612
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,510
target for fusion developers.

613
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,090
The cost targets
were $6,500, $8,000,

614
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,870
and $14,000 per
kilowatt for the 50, 12,

615
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,320
and 4 grams CO2 per kilowatt
hour emission intensity limits.

616
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,780
All the alternatives were
modeled with 2050 costs, which

617
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,330
means that these cost targets
are a little lower than they

618
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,950
might be, but they also
use 2050 emission limits,

619
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,510
which are very aggressive.

620
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,420
And so that would
make them higher

621
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,580
than they might otherwise be.

622
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,610
The center and right blocks
show the generation and capacity

623
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,130
factors as a function
of the costs.

624
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,030
At high emission
intensity limits,

625
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,730
we saw what we kind of
expected, the fusion plants.

626
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,970
So the fusion fleet,
the relatively expensive

627
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,680
acts as baseload.

628
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,180
And as the cost or if
the costs come down,

629
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,070
they substitute
for more resources.

630
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,590
We see more generation and
lower capacity factors.

631
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,440
But we were surprised
to see at the 4 grams

632
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,450
CO2 per kilowatt
hour emission limit.

633
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,540
Very expensive plants were
operating not quite as peakers,

634
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,590
but at low capacity factors.

635
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,110
And this is because the
alternatives and those sorts

636
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,840
of scenarios where you
couldn't run the natural gas

637
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,940
combined cycle with
CCS unit plants

638
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,739
for more than roughly
thousand hours per year.

639
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,070
Your alternative was
to build a lot more,

640
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,980
or a lot of extra renewables
and storage, which

641
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,230
was very expensive.

642
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,889
And so as long as
fusion plants were

643
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:27,030
able to be relatively
flexibly operated,

644
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,650
they could also be expensive
and still enter the grid.

645
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,300
So clearly, this
analysis depends

646
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,520
heavily on the alternatives
that fusion plants

647
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,600
are competing with.

648
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,900
And natural gas units with
CCS were the most important

649
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,659
of those.

650
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,270
So as a comparison, just
for this presentation,

651
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,440
we're showing what the installed
capacity of the fusion fleet

652
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,040
is with and without natural
gas units in the grid.

653
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,440
And we can see that if you
don't allow for any natural gas

654
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,340
or CCS, you essentially
increase all those cost targets

655
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,950
I've talked about
before by $4,000.

656
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,770
And we're not saying that
natural gas units with CCS

657
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,447
aren't going to be available
in New England in 2050.

658
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,030
But we wanted to
look at this scenario

659
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,447
because there are
plenty of places

660
00:35:07,447 --> 00:35:10,300
in the world where natural gas
is not as cheap as it is here.

661
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,527
And it's not clear that
large-scale carbon sequestration

662
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,610
is going to be possible
in all parts of the world.

663
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,850
So-- I'm sorry.

664
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,520
And finally, we assumed a
fixed 95% carbon capture

665
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,350
rate for all CCS
units, regardless

666
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,770
of how the plant operates.

667
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,590
And the more we look
into it, the more

668
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,350
that doesn't seem like it's
always going to be the case.

669
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,120
So for all those
reasons, there may

670
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,150
be scenarios where CCS units
have a much lesser role to play

671
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,920
and fusion can step in.

672
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,110
Our corollary, there are
also other technologies

673
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,940
that could step in,
and that's something

674
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,700
that we didn't consider
in as much detail.

675
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,710
But it'll be a topic
of future work.

676
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,757
With that, I'm going
to it back to Randy.

677
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:50,590
Thank you very much.

678
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,887
[APPLAUSE]

679
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:57,607

680
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:58,690
Thank you very much, Rory.

681
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,580

682
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,730
So Professor White and--

683
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,610
I'm sorry, Professor Dennis
Whyte, just for clarity,

684
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:15,750
and postdoc Theodore
Titus led the work stream

685
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,980
looking at the supply
chains for materials

686
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,360
and manufactured
parts for fusion.

687
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:31,670
Our assessment found that
different technologies

688
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,000
were at very different
stages of maturity.

689
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,660
And in the report, we
identify the issues as well as

690
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,110
the potential bottlenecks in the
supply chain for both materials

691
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:46,280
and for parts.

692
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,290
A key point is that we
do need additional R&D

693
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,400
to help develop materials that
are needed in the manufacturing

694
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,360
technologies for fusion.

695
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,650
This is more often the case in
the situation of technologies

696
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,820
that have almost no
market outside of fusion,

697
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,710
or a limited market
outside of fusion.

698
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,190
One example is the development
of tungsten heavy, which

699
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,790
is a very dense
alloy that can handle

700
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,705
the harsh conditions in a
fusion reactor but otherwise

701
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,950
[INAUDIBLE].

702
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,890
Whereas some things such as the
high-temperature superconductors

703
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,540
have a very strong market,
commercial opportunities

704
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,150
beyond fusion.

705
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,490
And those supply chains
are more mature, but not

706
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,590
necessarily at the scale
that we need for fusion.

707
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,550
And in fact, fusion has
helped develop those markets.

708
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,100
And that's pitching
quite well already, even

709
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,980
in the development of
our pilot technology.

710
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:53,100
So that's a very short
summary of what we

711
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,620
looked at on the supply chains.

712
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,910

713
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,210
The other piece of the
project was looking

714
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,440
at the question of cost.

715
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,710
So Professor Koroush Shirvan
and a graduate student,

716
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:16,160
Layla Aaraiinejad, led our
technoeconomic analysis.

717
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,460
In this cost analysis,
we examined prior studies

718
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,540
and publications that assess
the cost for alternative fusion

719
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,780
configurations.

720
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,920
We also conducted a
bottoms-up analysis.

721
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,630
One key observation of this
is that the fusion reactor

722
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,190
equipment is the leading cost
contributor to the overall plant

723
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,810
cost for fusion.

724
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,310
We also concluded that
how fusion is regulated

725
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,530
can have a very large
impact on the overall cost.

726
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,550
And the logical
upshot of that is

727
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:55,670
that fusion power plant designs
need to minimize the risks.

728
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,670
And governments need to adopt
the appropriate and effective

729
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,640
policies to ensure safe
use of fusion energy

730
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,910
while enabling fusion
to help contribute

731
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,000
to the decarbonization
goals that

732
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,070
exist in countries
and across the world.

733
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,120
We also observed that the
operating and maintenance

734
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,440
costs for fusion power plants
can be significant as well.

735
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,770

736
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,290
So some key takeaways
from the overall study--

737
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,680
and I certainly encourage you to
go to the MIT Energy Initiative

738
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,370
website, search for fusion,
and you'll see the report there

739
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,120
and you can get
into the details.

740
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,080
But a key takeaway
from this work

741
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,080
is that, as Sergey
had indicated,

742
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,560
fusion has a potential
societal value

743
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,390
in the trillions of dollars.

744
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,590
As we seek to decarbonize the
global electricity system,

745
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,410
fusion at the right
price can give us

746
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,830
great advantage to our
society and the scale

747
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,070
of multiple
trillions of dollars.

748
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,430
We also found that the
deployment and operation

749
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,120
of fusion plants is highly
dependent upon the fusion cost,

750
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,120
the cost and availability
of alternative low-carbon

751
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,300
technologies, as well as
what is the carbon constraint

752
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
that we're working with.

753
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,560
That is, how low
a carbon content

754
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,880
is our electricity being pushed
by policy and by governments

755
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,310
around the world?

756
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,770
We also know that
the growth of fusion

757
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:30,170
will be dependent
by region based

758
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,130
upon the economic and
electricity demand growth.

759
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,820
And also another key
finding within the report.

760
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,310
And what was led
by John Parsons was

761
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,790
the question of market design.

762
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,240
Market design can have
a very large impact

763
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,770
on the deployment of capital
intensive technologies

764
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,240
such as fusion,
as well as others.

765
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,750
So a question of how do you
design your electricity market

766
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,060
matters as well.

767
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,080
The other key finding is that
the ability for Fusion to scale

768
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,900
requires that we have the
materials, critical materials

769
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,967
and manufacturing
capabilities to support that.

770
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,550
Particularly for the
niche components,

771
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,910
we will need more
R&D in that field.

772
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:17,230
And for raw materials, we are
not anticipating showstoppers

773
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,730
there.

774
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,340
There will be some challenges,
but no showstoppers

775
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,260
to the deployment of fusion.

776
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,460
And on the slide, I'd
like to also acknowledge

777
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,460
the entire project team
and all the people who

778
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,695
contributed to the project.

779
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:35,280

780
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,180
There were many study
participants as well as

781
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,510
subject matter experts
and support staff

782
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,400
who supported this-- and as well
as this project was supported

783
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,530
by ENI, one of the key funders
of energy research at MIT.

784
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,020
So I thank the
participants and all

785
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,820
that supported this activity.

786
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,940
So with this, I'd like to
move into the next phase

787
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,420
of the program and invite
our speakers and panelists up

788
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,060
to the chairs in front.

789
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,820
And Professor Dennis White,
who was co-PI for this project,

790
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,500
he will be moderating
the discussion.

791
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,380
[APPLAUSE]

792
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,310

793
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,770
I'm going to sit at the end.

794
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,195
Great, everyone come up.

795
00:42:30,195 --> 00:42:32,270
[INAUDIBLE]

796
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,270
Well, thanks.

797
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,120
So I'd like to--

798
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,110
so as a fusion technologist,
I guess I scared

799
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,140
or inspired Sergey
back in Madrid.

800
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,057
To me, the value of this--

801
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:46,640
I can say, for a
person who has worked

802
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,540
in fusion for a long time--

803
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,450
people who work in fusion and
there are several of them here,

804
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,110
we tend to work on us thinking
of it as the perfect energy

805
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,050
source.

806
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,690
And when we make it
work, everybody's

807
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,680
going to use it because
it's so wonderful.

808
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,840
That's not how the
real world works.

809
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,780
The real world works around
markets, around price,

810
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,310
around availability.

811
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,790
And I think for me, the
greatest reveal that

812
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,245
came from this study was placing
fusion, even in some sense

813
00:43:14,245 --> 00:43:16,700
a limited way because we
only considered electricity,

814
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,440
but it really placed
markers on the ground for us

815
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,780
as fusion technologists to
understand what we must deliver,

816
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,215
in fact, to actually make
fusion have a difference.

817
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:27,760
It's the dream that--

818
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,130
the reason we all
started to do fusion.

819
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,270
So I'll actually start
in inverse in some sense

820
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,780
because what this made
me realize about how

821
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,410
important market design is.

822
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,990
But what market
are you going into,

823
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,950
how is it incentivized,
and so forth?

824
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:47,550
And particularly as we go
to a carbon-free energy

825
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,500
source, distribution
of energy sources,

826
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,650
fuel basically almost goes
away, essentially, as a cost.

827
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,380
And what happens is
that its capital cost

828
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,750
that starts to become dominant.

829
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,100
So I'm going to start
with John, actually.

830
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:05,220
Please introduce yourself,
and also comment as to what

831
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,160
you're thinking in terms of
market design for electrical

832
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,740
systems, which by themselves--
we just commenting up

833
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,410
in the-- as we were getting
miked up is that this itself is

834
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,200
evolving rapidly with things
like power purchase agreements

835
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,170
which are coming--

836
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,560
which are specifically
for high-end users

837
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,945
like Microsoft and Google.

838
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:22,570
So if you could please
comment on that,

839
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,300
I think that'd be a
good starting point.

840
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,842
Sure, so, yeah, I'm
happy to be here.

841
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:27,136
I'm John Persons.

842
00:44:27,136 --> 00:44:29,510
I'm the deputy
director of research

843
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,760
at the Center for Energy and
Environmental Policy Research,

844
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,090
which, in short, is
a bunch of economists

845
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,890
at MIT working in this space.

846
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,550
And I think the big issue--

847
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,840
Dennis characterized
it really well.

848
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,630
We've had a electricity system
generation, which has largely

849
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,750
depended on fuel with costs.

850
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,870
And that means we've managed
our electricity markets where,

851
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:02,430
as fuel prices vary, we
switch which generators are on

852
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:07,140
and, over time might switch
from one fuel source to another.

853
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,820
And the markets
are mainly focused

854
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:16,580
on sorting out that short-term
operational characteristic.

855
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,700
What we haven't had
to deal with as much

856
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,840
are exclusively capital
intensive investments.

857
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,750
And there are some
technical problems

858
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:34,710
with incentivizing investments,
the long-term heavy capital

859
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,890
investments as a result of the
way we manage our electricity

860
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:38,910
markets.

861
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,230
This isn't just
unique to fusion.

862
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,130
In fact, all decarbonated--

863
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,090
low-carbon generation
technologies so far

864
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,060
are basically
capital-intensive technologies.

865
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,305
And you have to make an
upfront capital investment.

866
00:45:54,305 --> 00:45:57,120
And one of the ways most
different societies have

867
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:02,770
decided to do that is to provide
a guaranteed revenue stream.

868
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,650
Whether in the United
States, it might

869
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,900
be with production
tax credits for wind,

870
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,120
for example, or for
solar and, in Europe,

871
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,080
feed in tariffs or contract
for differences or things

872
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,160
of that sort.

873
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,570
So you, basically,
are implementing

874
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:27,330
a very different model for
how you structure investments

875
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,740
in physical assets.

876
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,040
And we had gotten away from
that for a long window of time.

877
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,230
But if fusion is
going to move forward

878
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,660
as well as other decarbonized--

879
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,790
low-carbon generation,
we're going

880
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:48,930
to need to reinvigorate our
institutions that make decisions

881
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,740
about investments on behalf
of a whole electricity market

882
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,080
so that you can assure
an adequate income

883
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,100
stream to pay back the
financing of these big capital

884
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,790
investments.

885
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:04,930
Thanks, John.

886
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,810
Staying with, in some sense,
markets and, of course,

887
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,140
as a fusion person,
the question you always

888
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,795
get asked the most is when?

889
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:15,410
When is this going to happen?

890
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,903
And I would point out we have
to just for the study, we

891
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:19,570
have to make some
assumptions about when

892
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,637
it was going to appear.

893
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,220
We had to make some assumptions
and assumptions about doubling

894
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,640
rate of the capability.

895
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,330
But we saw the sense that it
wasn't shown in the slides.

896
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,650
But we took a look at this.

897
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,560
I mean, at MIT,
our theme has been,

898
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,350
let's try to make
fusion happen sooner.

899
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,660
But how soon is soon enough?

900
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,120
And this goes to
Randy and Sergei,

901
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,420
who I think really led
the charge on trying

902
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,420
to understand that part.

903
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,850

904
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,200
I'll take first dibs on
that [INAUDIBLE] Sergei.

905
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,220
But, basically, as you saw
in some of Sergei's plots,

906
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,420
let me step back a moment.

907
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,340
Because of
electrification globally,

908
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:06,240
there's going to be a tremendous
switching from the fossil fuels

909
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,980
for electricity.

910
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,727
And a lot of people will
be joining the middle class

911
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:12,060
in different parts of the world.

912
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,150
And so, overall, there's
a tremendous growth

913
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:16,760
of energy demand
throughout the world

914
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,540
and for electricity
throughout the world.

915
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,700
And so my view is it's never
too late to bring in fusion

916
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,590
because there will always be
more demand for electricity.

917
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,400
And even in Sergei's slots,
as we saw fusion take off,

918
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,080
you don't see the green go away.

919
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,170
The green stays put.

920
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,410
So it's not like you're
displacing wind and solar.

921
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,530
But they're living
together in harmony.

922
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:43,100
Yeah, well, another dimension--

923
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,590
well, typically, if you're
already seeing the report,

924
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,030
actually, the work has been
done like a year ago or half

925
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,070
a year ago, where
I'm getting to.

926
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,970
Well, right now, we are
seeing the explosion

927
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:01,190
of different projections, how
AI is going to affect the energy

928
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,530
demand [INAUDIBLE] and all
these data centers, all

929
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,840
these hyperscalers.

930
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,340
Well, John Parsons is
an expert in nuclear.

931
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:15,670
And the recent announcement
of Microsoft and Mile Island--

932
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,632
so everybody was
excited about that.

933
00:49:17,632 --> 00:49:19,090
And [INAUDIBLE]
excited about that.

934
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,160
And [INAUDIBLE] commenting
on that kind of.

935
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,530
So the point is, even these
projections, which you already

936
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,920
saw, which are quite aggressive
in terms of the electrification

937
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,440
and energy demand,
we still may be

938
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,040
on the low side of what
actually will be needed.

939
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,250
And so that's one of the reasons
we need all of the above.

940
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:48,950
We need as much as possible
of this carbon-free energy

941
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,150
of very low-carbon energy or
almost carbon-free energy.

942
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,090
And so fusion is
giving us that promise.

943
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:00,680
And, hopefully, it's
not just a promise.

944
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,570
To add to that one,
a recent one is

945
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:06,200
Google announced a partnership--
or an agreement with Kairos

946
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,210
Power, which is built
on-- it's interesting.

947
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,510
It has adjacent technologies
to our own work as well too.

948
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,370
So this actually goes over
to Sara about technical work.

949
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:20,190
And please introduce
yourself as well too.

950
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,050
We also had to make
assumptions in here

951
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,750
that we called it a
firm dispatchable power

952
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,630
source with some certain
amount of availability.

953
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,900
If those go away, then it's
economic attractiveness

954
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,107
or it's market penetration
clearly get impacted maybe.

955
00:50:34,107 --> 00:50:36,190
And we're going to hear
more about this in detail.

956
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,070
But could you sort
of comment to it

957
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,400
in the context of this study
about how important availability

958
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,590
component reliability is?

959
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:44,560
So I'm Sara Ferry.

960
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,370
I'm the group leader for
fusion materials and components

961
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,870
at the PSFC.

962
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:53,340
So a lot of our work is looking
at the different systems

963
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:58,170
that mostly tokamak-based power
plants would need in order

964
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,320
to become power plants and
going from a research device

965
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,000
that [INAUDIBLE] to
something that is

966
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,960
capable of [INAUDIBLE] energy.

967
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,390
And so this encompasses
everything from the breeder

968
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,900
blanket to really, really
reliable first-wall components,

969
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,400
all of these things
that are exposed

970
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,410
to very high
temperatures, corrosive

971
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,450
working fluids,
high-energy neutron fluxes,

972
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,500
high temperatures.

973
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,410
And we know that they're going
to need frequent replacement

974
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,600
or maintenance because
there's no perfect material

975
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,520
solution for these.

976
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,130
So in addition to thinking
about materials development

977
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,230
and selection, a lot of
what we have to work on

978
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:36,620
is thinking about maintenance
from the beginning,

979
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:41,200
so designing components that
don't take months to disassemble

980
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,910
in order to get
in there, in order

981
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,450
to do necessary
maintenance or replacement

982
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,780
and then get things back online
because, from the research

983
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,900
world, we often see major
experimental facilities

984
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,270
down for months
or years, whenever

985
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,070
upgrades or fixes are needed.

986
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,560
And we know that
is not going to be

987
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,150
acceptable in a power plant that
is designed for commercial use.

988
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,560
So there's a lot of
different axes to think on.

989
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,113
And I think one thing
we can be aware of

990
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:10,780
is that it's not
enough just to say, oh,

991
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,690
I'm going to develop a higher
performance material that's

992
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:16,342
good for this particular
part of the plant.

993
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,550
You also have to think about
the component as a whole

994
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,950
and how it will actually
be used because,

995
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,082
otherwise, you can design
yourself into a corner.

996
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:25,540
And it will be very hard to
get out of it when it turns out

997
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,850
that it's not very
easy to get in there

998
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:31,247
and do replacements or anything.

999
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:31,830
Thanks , Sara.

1000
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:36,050
And, for me, as I saw this-- and
I'm going to turn to Rory now

1001
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,420
around this-- is this
is exactly why we

1002
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,100
have these kinds
of studies because

1003
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,933
of the complex interplay.

1004
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:44,850
As technologists, we
just tend to think, well,

1005
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,980
I'm going to make the
technology better.

1006
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,370
But what does that mean?

1007
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,423
What does it mean from an
economic point of view?

1008
00:52:50,423 --> 00:52:52,840
What does it mean from a market
penetration point of view?

1009
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,050
And there's a few things
that particularly came out

1010
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:58,770
of your aspect of the detailed
study of the ISO, Rory, that

1011
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,920
came as surprises to me of--

1012
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,100
may be, in retrospect, not so
surprising about the importance

1013
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,620
of the cost of the
replacement factors in it,

1014
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:11,940
of the materials of
the nameplate power

1015
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,390
capability of it.

1016
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,510
And, also, another
somewhat of a surprise

1017
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,950
is that we tend
to think of fusion

1018
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,810
is steady-state power sources.

1019
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,510
But, actually, what
popped out was, oh,

1020
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,760
this actually has a role as what
we call a peaker, essentially.

1021
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,850
Could you comment to that?

1022
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,690
Yeah, and, to follow
up on Sara's point,

1023
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,520
we kind of ran the
sensitivity studies

1024
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,900
of [INAUDIBLE] three
months or six months

1025
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,302
or a year to [INAUDIBLE].

1026
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:37,760
We'll be seeing hundreds of
thousands of dollars of savings

1027
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,300
in [INAUDIBLE].

1028
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,360
Definitely has a big impact,
maybe even more so than the life

1029
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,815
of [INAUDIBLE].

1030
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:47,500
But fusion [INAUDIBLE],
your future operators

1031
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,420
perhaps will be able to play a
game of prices are lower today.

1032
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,090
Perhaps I'm not
going to sell power

1033
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,725
to preserve some of
these components.

1034
00:53:53,725 --> 00:53:55,600
And so the operation of
some of these devices

1035
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,120
could be quite complicated.

1036
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,490
But yeah, we did see
that, particularly

1037
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:02,320
for any plant that pulsed.

1038
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,570
And so it had quite
a reasonable ability

1039
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,300
to change its output every 20
or 30 minutes with those pulses.

1040
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,990
Then it's not that they
ran in a peaker in the way

1041
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,190
that a combined
cycle turbine would,

1042
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,590
but they would be
on for days, weeks.

1043
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,420
And then they'll be off for
a similar amount of time.

1044
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,500
And that's where you've got
that drop in capacity factor.

1045
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,470
And a lot of that, though,
was driven by the fact of--

1046
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,870
by the choice of alternatives
that we did or didn't include--

1047
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,480
so maybe to circle
back to your point

1048
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,610
earlier about the
when doesn't matter.

1049
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,880
The when matters a bit if
someone gets there first.

1050
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,390
So if someone invents a magical,
perfect, clean fuel tomorrow,

1051
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,540
then anything competing
with that clean fuel

1052
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,830
might be in a bit of trouble.

1053
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:47,160
But there are unique features
to things like fusion

1054
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,280
that will also help it.

1055
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:51,780
Thanks.

1056
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,070
So that's great.

1057
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,810
And as I said, I really
appreciated this.

1058
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,800
I think these are
the kinds of models

1059
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,290
that we take as technologists
and then try to understand,

1060
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,000
what's the most--
so I get inspired

1061
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
a little bit in my fusion design
class that actually happened

1062
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,730
at that latter end of the
study is that I switched

1063
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,270
from a perfect to a cheaper
set of replacement materials

1064
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,560
because I realized that
was probably a good one.

1065
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,080
So now we're going to take a
few questions from the audience.

1066
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,030
[INAUDIBLE]

1067
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:20,025
Please don't be shy.

1068
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:45,090

1069
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,690
Get ready for a good ride.

1070
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,430
[LAUGHING]

1071
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:48,930

1072
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,950
Rory and I both come from
the vision side as well.

1073
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,470
So it's interesting
that you're going

1074
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:58,080
to tend to probably think
in terms of neutronics

1075
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,760
more than people
who maybe have had

1076
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,630
most of their career
in plasma physics.

1077
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,960
And everyone's
aware of both sides.

1078
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,610
But, when we first started doing
a lot of the work with CFS,

1079
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,210
I think we found
that a lot of people

1080
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:14,580
were maybe underestimating
how impactful neutrons would

1081
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,980
be to operations
overall, everything

1082
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,800
from material degradation,
plus, obviously, you

1083
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,070
need that for the heat and
the breeding and the blanket

1084
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:23,657
as well.

1085
00:56:23,657 --> 00:56:25,740
So I actually think that
being on the fission side

1086
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,310
gives you a good advantage
because you're already

1087
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,580
really used to working in that
particular type of environment

1088
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,380
as well as also
being intrinsically

1089
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,300
aware of the safety
issues that come

1090
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,280
with any nuclear technology.

1091
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,870
And so I think it
helps you maybe see

1092
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,620
things in a holistic way that
I think is super helpful.

1093
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,410
Congratulations on it.

1094
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,810
And, actually, you'll see it.

1095
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:49,570
To preview what's
coming, you'll see

1096
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,650
that a lot of the new directions
of research here at MIT

1097
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,320
are moving us towards
these key aspects

1098
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,310
of the nuclear technologies that
are required to actually deliver

1099
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,920
what we put into the study,
which is an attractive energy

1100
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,420
source.

1101
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,130
And, in a general
way, those have

1102
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,430
tended to lag behind
because of a lack of people

1103
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,630
working on it, actually.

1104
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,080
There's a lot of
synergy between--

1105
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,090
A lot of synergy.

1106
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,180
--and fusion [INAUDIBLE].

1107
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,617
So both communities are--

1108
00:57:15,617 --> 00:57:17,200
it's cool to maybe
have an opportunity

1109
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,450
to bring both those communities
together more as well.

1110
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:22,400

1111
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,200
Don't be shy.

1112
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,450
Is there somebody in the back?

1113
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:24,950
Yep.

1114
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,442

1115
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:30,150
Hi, sorry, if I missed
this at the start,

1116
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,010
but how was vision
treated in the study?

1117
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,830
Because a lot of the
conclusions that I saw

1118
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,410
about fusion look very
similar to conclusions

1119
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:39,950
about the future role of
vision in other studies.

1120
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,100
So, yeah.

1121
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,990
Sure, so we were very--

1122
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,650
we needed to make a decision
about this right up front

1123
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,060
in doing the study.

1124
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,530
Basically, fusion and
fission, as you indicated

1125
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:55,820
compete for the exact same
place in the electric grid.

1126
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,170
We talk here about firm power.

1127
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:02,150
And Bob mentioned that
they're both energy dense,

1128
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,060
and that's a particular
competitive niche

1129
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,400
in the electricity market.

1130
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,390
However, they have differences.

1131
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:13,160
They will be advantaged
by different technological

1132
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,240
developments.

1133
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,160
They have very
different safety cases,

1134
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,080
different political and
social acceptance issues.

1135
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,220
And so what we decided
to do was focus

1136
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,880
primarily on that
competitive space that

1137
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,330
would be common to both
of them and identify

1138
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:39,770
that competitive space, but
not try to understand or make

1139
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,860
any predictions about
one versus the other

1140
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,650
on those other dimensions as
they're going to evolve over

1141
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,310
the next couple of decades.

1142
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:52,910
So we didn't try to evaluate,
compare them or anything.

1143
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,998
One last one.

1144
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:56,790
Hold on one second.

1145
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,380
I just got to bring you
a mic for our recording.

1146
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:58,880
I'm sorry.

1147
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,322

1148
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:03,780
I was wondering if
you had a chance

1149
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,370
to take a look at
the supply chain.

1150
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,080
And are there any
critical materials

1151
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,770
that are choke points outside
of our friends and neighbors?

1152
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,310
Yeah, we did, actually.

1153
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,970
The general conclusion
was there was not

1154
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,900
any bottlenecks in there.

1155
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,190
It actually comes from
the very nature of fusion,

1156
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,520
it being so incredibly
power dense.

1157
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,130
And what you're actually
building-- what you're building

1158
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,950
has very few specialized
elements in it, essentially.

1159
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,580
In the particularly
magnetic confinement,

1160
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,610
basically, big chunks of steel
that are called electromagnets.

1161
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:41,030
And the other-- what is termed
as the exotic components

1162
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,820
is actually not very much in it.

1163
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,470
There's a few exceptions
of things right now,

1164
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,170
like beryllium, for
example, where we have--

1165
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,470
but that's really--
our assessment was

1166
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,080
that was really more a
market because there's so

1167
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,010
little demand for it right now.

1168
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,280
That's actually why it appears
that it might be an issue.

1169
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,400
But, in fact,
there's alternatives.

1170
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,488
And then the markets
could respond as well too.

1171
01:00:03,488 --> 01:00:05,030
So, in general, we
found there wasn't

1172
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,910
really much of an issue there.

1173
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:09,392
Good question, though.

1174
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:12,400
But I think that was it for
the-- thanks for the panelists.

1175
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,470
Yep, thank you.

1176
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,638
[AUDIENCE]

1177
01:00:16,638 --> 01:00:22,870

1178
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,110
So thank you, Dennis,
Randy, panelists.

1179
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:30,670
And thanks again to the
entire group of 30 plus who

1180
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,310
did the research in this study.

1181
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,800
I'd like to shift now to the
second part of the program.

1182
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,400
And I want to turn
the podium over

1183
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,580
to Professor, Nuno
Loureiro, who's

1184
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,060
the director of the MIT Plasma
Science and Fusion Center.

1185
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:52,030
He's also a professor of Nuclear
Science and Engineering at MIT.

1186
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:55,140
And he will introduce the
next part of the program.

1187
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:07,360

1188
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,400
Good afternoon, everybody.

1189
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,740
Thank you, Randy, for
organizing this wonderful event.

1190
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,710
I'm delighted to be here.

1191
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:16,820
So we're shifting
gears a little bit.

1192
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,240
This part of the
session's focusing on,

1193
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,570
what it is that we're doing
here at MIT to actually deliver

1194
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:24,558
a fusion energy?

1195
01:01:24,558 --> 01:01:26,350
So it's almost irrespective
of whether it's

1196
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:31,030
going to be beneficial to--

1197
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,920
well, I guess many
of us think of it

1198
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,420
as, is it going to be
beneficial to mankind or not?

1199
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,050
But some of us are in it just
for the science and the thrill

1200
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,100
of doing great discoveries.

1201
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,010
And I guess I fit more in the
latter category than the former.

1202
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,540
But, of course, I understand
the practical considerations

1203
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,520
are paramount.

1204
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,400
This is a very brief overview.

1205
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,460
The real stars of this
show are my colleagues

1206
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,150
who are going to speak
right after me, focusing

1207
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,730
different aspects of what we're
doing at the Plasma Science

1208
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,770
and Fusion Center.

1209
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:05,300
So this is a beautiful
picture of what the PSFC is.

1210
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,980
You're looking at-- from
above, obviously, this

1211
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,470
is Mass Ave. This
is Albany Street,

1212
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:15,430
and the buildings here in
pink are the Plasma Science

1213
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,690
and Fusion Center.

1214
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,440
And the reason I'm
showing you this is not

1215
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,790
to brag about my realm,
but rather to tell you

1216
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:27,490
that this is the
scale that's required

1217
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:31,450
if you want to solve the kinds
of problems that are posed

1218
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,180
by delivering fusion energy.

1219
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,400
This is not tabletop science.

1220
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,430
This is science that requires
big infrastructure, huge teams,

1221
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,295
a lot of money.

1222
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:43,960

1223
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,750
So the fusion world
is unrecognizable

1224
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,560
compared to what it looked
like five years ago.

1225
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:58,260
And I think the PSFC
team, led by Dennis White,

1226
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:03,620
was absolutely instrumental in
changing what fusion is and as

1227
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,060
compared to what was.

1228
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:07,550
And so the landmark on
that was the launching

1229
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:11,760
of the MIT CFS partnership
about five years ago.

1230
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,060
And that's really
triggered the revolution

1231
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:19,290
in how society is
approaching fusion research.

1232
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:25,290
And the underlying theme
to this is that many of us

1233
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:28,680
have had enough with the
conversation of 20 years

1234
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,300
from now.

1235
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:34,350
I think we are all
firm believers in now

1236
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,590
is better than later.

1237
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:38,580
And there's something we can
do about it right now that

1238
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,110
doesn't have to wait 20 years.

1239
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,810
Now, of course,
this is rooted in

1240
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:46,150
deep technological
innovation, which

1241
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:50,590
has been the staple at the
Plasma Science and Fusion Center

1242
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,780
for as long as it has existed.

1243
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,810
It's not just private funding.

1244
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:59,480
The US government and
governments throughout the world

1245
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,630
are also aggressively
promoting fusion in ways

1246
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,440
that they weren't doing before.

1247
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,410
And so I think the most
noteworthy event here

1248
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,100
in the United States
was the White House

1249
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,850
Summit a couple of
years ago on developing

1250
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:18,230
a bold, decadal vision for
commercializing fusion energy.

1251
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,680
So decadal means
10 years in case

1252
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,190
you're not paying attention.

1253
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:25,390
So this is a very
aggressive timeline

1254
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:29,380
for when it is that
we are actually trying

1255
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,340
to promote fusion on the grid.

1256
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,230
And so, as a result
of that, they've

1257
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:37,140
selected a few companies
that they are--

1258
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,590
they've identified as
perhaps the most promising

1259
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:45,300
in the road to
delivering fusion power.

1260
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:49,260
And PSFC has very
tight collaborations

1261
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,700
with several of these.

1262
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,400
And the ones with
which we don't, I

1263
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,930
think they very much want
to be involved with us.

1264
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:59,690
That's a fair statement.

1265
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:07,620
Now, this slide is a sort of--
for us, in the fusion field,

1266
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,500
this is a slide that
you wouldn't even

1267
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,300
dream of five years ago.

1268
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:16,140
So, right now, we're talking
about venture capital,

1269
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:21,630
upwards of $6 billion raised in
the last five years for fusion.

1270
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,790
These are some of the companies.

1271
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:28,400
This slide is almost
instantaneously outdated

1272
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,500
at the moment you
do it because it

1273
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,140
seems like every other week
there's a new fusion startup.

1274
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,190
So it's a very exciting
space right now

1275
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:39,750
with different
concepts coming online,

1276
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,710
people sort of working
on this problem from very

1277
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:43,920
different angles.

1278
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,853
And some of these concepts are
more promising than others.

1279
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:49,520
But I think this is
of approach that you

1280
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,880
need where you need
more than one data point

1281
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,210
to identify what's going to be
the most promising technology.

1282
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:01,020
And, of course, we know in
science and in engineering

1283
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,830
that competition is good.

1284
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:08,190
So this is what a bubbling,
exciting scientific and

1285
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:11,710
technological
adventure looks like.

1286
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,470
A lot of people looking
at these problems

1287
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,190
from very different angles.

1288
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:20,990
So, very quickly,
to create a device

1289
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:22,290
that produces more energy.

1290
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,450
So if you want to
have fusion energy,

1291
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,970
at least in the magnetic
confinement fusion approach,

1292
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:28,970
you need strong and
efficient magnets

1293
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:35,810
to confine the fusion plasmas
and innovating and really

1294
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:39,830
setting the state of the
art in magnet technology

1295
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,460
is the key thing that
brought us from five years

1296
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,980
to where we are now at the
Plasma Science and Fusion

1297
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,910
Center.

1298
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,320
We also need peak plasma
fusion performance.

1299
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,080
You can run worse plasmas.

1300
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,340
You can run better plasmas.

1301
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,180
And having the knowledge
of how to optimize that

1302
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,020
is absolutely critical.

1303
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,210
Turns out this is a
very complex problem.

1304
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,650
And not only do you need to do
all the high-powered theory that

1305
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:07,580
some of us wish they could
do, but you also need

1306
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,890
state-of-the-art computing,
machine learning,

1307
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,980
quantum computing.

1308
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,400
And it's fantastic in
the sense that some

1309
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:18,590
of the problems that we are
facing in the fusion realm

1310
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,120
develop tools that are
actually transportable

1311
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,820
to many other problems, problems
in other fields of science.

1312
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,470
And that's also
very interesting.

1313
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:30,240
We need a way to convert
energy into power.

1314
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,780
So we didn't get into details
about how this actually works.

1315
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,300
But, at the end
of the day, you're

1316
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,450
producing high-energy
neutrons, and it's that energy

1317
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:40,000
that you're trying to tap.

1318
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,930
And so how you go
about doing this

1319
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:46,370
is a fascinating scientific and
technological problem that I

1320
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,120
would argue we
haven't quite solved,

1321
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,850
and we need to put more
resources behind that.

1322
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,085
And then, finally,
we need materials.

1323
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:57,700
Fusion devices, the way that we
are conceiving them right now

1324
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,980
will hold the
largest temperature

1325
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,480
gradient in the solar system.

1326
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:08,930
So the core of the plasma
that sits here is roughly

1327
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:11,820
at 150,000,000
degrees centigrade.

1328
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:15,840
But about a meter outwards,
you have a material surface

1329
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,460
that's perhaps, at best, at
1,000 degrees centigrade.

1330
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,060
And so the materials that are
going to withstand that neutron

1331
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:27,006
flux and that heat flux are
very important for the success

1332
01:08:27,006 --> 01:08:27,714
of this endeavor.

1333
01:08:27,714 --> 01:08:30,760

1334
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,729
In this session, you're hearing
most about magnetic confinement

1335
01:08:33,729 --> 01:08:34,370
fusion.

1336
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:36,490
But the inertial
confinement fusion

1337
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:39,880
has a very strong and honored
presence at the Plasma Science

1338
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,010
and Fusion Center.

1339
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:44,560
You may have heard about the
record shots on the NIF facility

1340
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,859
over at Livermore.

1341
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:48,830
Our team is heavily
involved in that.

1342
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,470
And, in fact, they're a
central piece to that success.

1343
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,612
So I just want to flag
this in case anybody

1344
01:08:53,612 --> 01:08:54,529
is interested in this.

1345
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:57,374
You can ask me or us at
the end of the session.

1346
01:08:57,374 --> 01:09:01,050

1347
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:06,270
This is largely a very
optimistic but also realistic

1348
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,390
view of things.

1349
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:10,149
But that doesn't mean that
we've solved every problem.

1350
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:12,990
And, for example, one of the
problems we're facing right now

1351
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:18,750
is the need for developing the
fusion workforce, the people who

1352
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:23,170
are actually going to man
the fusion power companies,

1353
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:23,979
for example.

1354
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:27,029
So we need to expand
fusion education in the US

1355
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,319
and I think elsewhere.

1356
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,660
Dennis White has a
wonderful paper on this.

1357
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,680
And the US Academy
is just not prepared.

1358
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,710
We need more fusion instructors.

1359
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,840
I mean, we have
proven here at MIT

1360
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,359
that we can educate
our students very well.

1361
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:42,390
So many of the people
you'll hear from today

1362
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,720
were actually our alumni.

1363
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,580
They are our alumni.

1364
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:49,950
And some of us will go out, and
they start fusion companies, not

1365
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:53,319
just CFS but elsewhere.

1366
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:57,190
We need capable but sort
of fast, not decadal,

1367
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,740
time scales,
experimental facilities

1368
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,320
to test the different
parts that go

1369
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,420
into making a successful
fusion power plant.

1370
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,760
And this is always
going to be hard tech.

1371
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,600
It's always going
to be big science.

1372
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,440
It's never going to
be less than millions

1373
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,490
and millions of dollars.

1374
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:13,970
That's just the
name of the game.

1375
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,730
That's the level of
resources that you need.

1376
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:22,170
And, finally, if we're actually
serious about having a fusion

1377
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:25,740
industry, we need to be very
serious about the fusion supply

1378
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,410
chain.

1379
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,290
And we need to be
very serious about all

1380
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,380
the commercial opportunities,
not just directly in the fusion

1381
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:35,400
supply chain, but in all the
spinoff technologies, such

1382
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,390
as, for example, using
fusion heating systems

1383
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,108
for geothermal energy.

1384
01:10:41,108 --> 01:10:42,900
There's immense commercial
opportunity here

1385
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,660
that goes well beyond
the economic value

1386
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,810
that fusion itself
might present.

1387
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,280
So we won't have time to go
into detail in all of these

1388
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,820
in the following presentations.

1389
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,760
But I wanted to
at least leave you

1390
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,940
with some of these key words
so that for your reflection

1391
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,230
or to ask us later.

1392
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:02,760
So, with that, I'll transition
to the next speaker, Professor

1393
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,440
Zach Hartwig.

1394
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,670

1395
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,100
[APPLAUSE]

1396
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:15,510

1397
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,340
Hey, everybody, good evening.

1398
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,350
So I'm going to follow
on Nuno's presentation

1399
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,892
and actually talk
to you a little bit

1400
01:11:20,892 --> 01:11:24,960
about some of the things we
can do to accelerate but still

1401
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,670
be at reasonable scale, which
is really the key thing.

1402
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:28,757
So this is a picture.

1403
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:30,340
We'll talk a little
bit more about it.

1404
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,010
But it's a picture
of a facility that we

1405
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:35,050
hope to build at the Plasma
Science and Fusion Center.

1406
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:37,870
And I'll tell you a bit about
why it's transformational.

1407
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:41,520
So I open this
slide with a quote

1408
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,947
from a director of
Idaho National Lab who

1409
01:11:43,947 --> 01:11:45,030
I had a conversation with.

1410
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,480
And he said something
which I really liked.

1411
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,980
He said, if fusion is ever going
to be an energy technology,

1412
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,172
it's a materials problem.

1413
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,880
Yeah, there's lots of
other things in it,

1414
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,223
but this is ultimately
where fusion has to go.

1415
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:56,640
And so I really like that quote
because it kind of defines

1416
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,220
this moment in fusion where
we're kind of moving away

1417
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,770
from science program, and
we're moving towards an energy

1418
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:02,790
technology.

1419
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,210
It's a great quote
that sums it up.

1420
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,260
So here you can see the
graphic we've shown, right.

1421
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,488
There's 40 private companies.

1422
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:11,280
You can see the bubble
of fusion that we're

1423
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,610
in because, in the time since
Nuno gave his slide and I have,

1424
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:18,110
we've raised an additional
$7 billion in private fusion.

1425
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,260
That's great.

1426
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,860
Dozens of companies who were not
there five years ago are there.

1427
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:27,220
Those companies have also
changed the National program

1428
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:27,770
efforts.

1429
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:30,170
They're realigning to
support private fusion.

1430
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:32,990
They're drawing in the
time scales by decades.

1431
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:35,710
And this is actually caught
serious parts of the fusion

1432
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,450
program quite out.

1433
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:42,050
Materials who have been planned
to be deployed in 30 years

1434
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,240
now need to be deployed in 10.

1435
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,300
So what are those
parts of the fusion

1436
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,100
program doing to address that?

1437
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,480
Well, we need to address that.

1438
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:50,980
Why?

1439
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,290
Because every approach
that Randy mentioned,

1440
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:55,970
doesn't matter what it is,
has a materials challenge.

1441
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:58,450
And, ultimately, you
can tie those materials

1442
01:12:58,450 --> 01:12:59,830
to economic viability.

1443
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,330
At the end of the day, that's
what materials do for fusion--

1444
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,300
they make it work or not.

1445
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,030
So that's why materials
are important.

1446
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,540
We touched on this a little bit.

1447
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,498
We don't have time to go
into too many details,

1448
01:13:10,498 --> 01:13:12,610
but we have common
challenges in fusion.

1449
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:15,410
It doesn't matter really
what the challenge is.

1450
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,190
One challenge is
we make neutrons

1451
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:20,500
deuterium-tritium
fusion is the first fuel

1452
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,220
cycle we're likely to embrace.

1453
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,470
It's going to make neutrons.

1454
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:25,940
Those neutrons damage materials.

1455
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,980
They displace atoms
in the lattice.

1456
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,320
They put helium and hydrogen
into those materials.

1457
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,590
And that's a
significant problem.

1458
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:36,790
And it turns out that the energy
that those neutrons interact

1459
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:39,920
with the materials, that varies
as you move around this device.

1460
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,860
And so the different damage is
happening in different regions.

1461
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:44,930
It's quite an
interesting challenge.

1462
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,975
What are some of
those challenges?

1463
01:13:46,975 --> 01:13:48,730
So we have structural materials.

1464
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:51,190
Dennis mentioned these are
mostly power plants built out

1465
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:52,070
of steel.

1466
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:52,850
What can happen?

1467
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,980
Well, you get
radiation-induced damage.

1468
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,050
You get embrittlement.

1469
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:59,770
Materials become strong, but
they can become very weak.

1470
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,920
They can shatter.

1471
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,880
You get creep.

1472
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,870
You get swelling.

1473
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:04,132
Materials actually will move.

1474
01:14:04,132 --> 01:14:05,590
You can actually
see the difference

1475
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,460
in materials that have been
in a nuclear environment.

1476
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,350
They grow.

1477
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,360
This can be a problem.

1478
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,050
We have chemical compatibility.

1479
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:15,470
We want to put a structural
material in contact

1480
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:17,600
with a molten salt or
a molten metal at 800

1481
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,940
C. That's an environment
where corrosion

1482
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,180
becomes very difficult.

1483
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,570
We have other challenges.

1484
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,980
So we have materials in
contact with the plasma.

1485
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,530
We'd like to think
of the plasma,

1486
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,850
at least in the tokamak being
held in a magnetic bottle.

1487
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,450
But it's not a perfect bottle.

1488
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,840
So the materials are
interacting quite substantially

1489
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,920
with the plasma.

1490
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,450
So we have issues.

1491
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:40,430
Fuel, like tritium, is actually
sucked up into a material.

1492
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,230
It's retained.

1493
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:43,090
It can be very hard to get out.

1494
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,950
We actually have
radiation damage

1495
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,920
that can complicate many of the
interactions between a plasma

1496
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,010
and a material.

1497
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:52,660
And we're really just starting
to explore these interactions

1498
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,120
in a relevant way for
a fusion power plant.

1499
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,320
We have some more
exotic challenges.

1500
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,770
We have things like functional
materials in a fusion power

1501
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,270
plant.

1502
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,430
We have superconductors.

1503
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,390
Superconducting magnets form
one of the key cost drivers

1504
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,530
of a fusion system in the core.

1505
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,010
We're going to irradiate
those very expensive magnets

1506
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,810
with neutrons, and they're
going to degrade over time.

1507
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:14,140
And this is going to
have a significant impact

1508
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,840
on the lifetime of the
device and the economics.

1509
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,080
We have other things.

1510
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,650
We have browning of optical
glass and mirrors and things

1511
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:25,110
that we use to provide access
to lasers and other diagnostics.

1512
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:27,020
Lots of materials challenges.

1513
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:28,560
So what are we doing today?

1514
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,210
And what are we planning to do?

1515
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:31,470
OK, so what do we do today?

1516
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,230
Well, one thing
we do primarily is

1517
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:35,960
we use the fleet
of nuclear fission

1518
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,090
reactors around the
world, test reactors,

1519
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:39,950
to irradiate materials.

1520
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,397
This is a picture
of the MIT core.

1521
01:15:41,397 --> 01:15:42,980
It's kind of a
beautiful picture where

1522
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,690
you see the Cherenkov light.

1523
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,410
This is just down
the street from us.

1524
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:48,750
There's some significant
disadvantages.

1525
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,370
Damage is very slow.

1526
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:53,360
It takes a long time to
get to relevant regimes.

1527
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,040
These are very
expensive measurements.

1528
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,740
There are very few facilities,
and they're shutting down.

1529
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,660
So that's a problem.

1530
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,290
As we're trying to
ramp up this work,

1531
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,990
facilities are shutting down.

1532
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,330
The long and few
learning cycles means

1533
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:09,030
we don't have a chance to do
rapid iteration to design,

1534
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,300
to test, and then
to use that learning

1535
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,160
to design a better material.

1536
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,810
And they're not very
good fidelity for fusion.

1537
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,550
We don't get the
right kind of damage.

1538
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:21,390
We have much lower energy
neutrons than high energy.

1539
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,580
What's the fusion world
doing about this problem?

1540
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,950
Reactors don't work.

1541
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,150
Well, currently the
world is planning

1542
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:30,040
a device which is going to
be many billions of dollars.

1543
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:33,130
It may be operational
in the 2040s.

1544
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,390
This is a program called IFMIF.

1545
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,190
It's mainly driven by Europe
and Japanese collaboration.

1546
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,970
The US is considering
doing something similar.

1547
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:46,170
It's a massive facility
operational in decades.

1548
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,180
And we've heard
many times that's

1549
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,770
not going to be acceptable.

1550
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,900
We have companies who
need to make decisions

1551
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:54,160
about materials in
the next few years,

1552
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,700
not in the next [INAUDIBLE].

1553
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,880
Low damage rate, limited
exposure conditions.

1554
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,470
Maybe it's operational
in the late 2030s.

1555
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,540
Probably not.

1556
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,270
And how do you scale a
multibillion-dollar facility

1557
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,860
to the dozens that
might be needed

1558
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,790
to evaluate materials rapidly?

1559
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,190
It's a really hard challenge.

1560
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,050
So we have to think
very differently

1561
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,540
about how we tackle these
challenges [INAUDIBLE].

1562
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,580
And I thought what I
might do is show you

1563
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,890
two examples of what
we're doing at MIT

1564
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,560
that are kind of
upending this model,

1565
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,310
doing things fast, doing things
quickly, doing things at very

1566
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:29,600
high fidelity by being
creative, what we do at MIT.

1567
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,100
So one of the
things we mentioned

1568
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,840
is superconductors degrade
under radiation damage.

1569
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,980
We don't want to wait around
to put those materials

1570
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,030
in a nuclear reactor or wait
around for a fusion power plant.

1571
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,120
What can we do?

1572
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,570
This is a picture on the right
of an accelerator beamline

1573
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:46,520
that's down on Albany Street.

1574
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,790
And we've come up with a way to
essentially put superconductor

1575
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,480
in cryogenic temperatures.

1576
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,710
So minus 450 C, run
it with current,

1577
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:57,980
and actually bombard
it with protons.

1578
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,690
So we can actually
get measurements

1579
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:02,060
done in the span
of minutes to hours

1580
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:05,250
that might take weeks to
months to do elsewhere,

1581
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,920
very low radioactivity.

1582
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,070
It's right here on campus.

1583
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:12,507
It's very easy to do rapid
experiments and even simpler.

1584
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:13,590
So this is just a picture.

1585
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:16,220
You can't have a talk at
MIT without a CAD drawing

1586
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:19,300
and some indecipherable
graphics.

1587
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,470
But we put the
superconductor here.

1588
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,160
We cool it down.

1589
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,950
We hit it with a proton beam.

1590
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,920
Why is this important to do?

1591
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,670
OK, so here's a plot.

1592
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:30,260
This is accumulating
radiation damage.

1593
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,780
So this is the time that
you run your fusion device.

1594
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,930
And this is the
superconductor performance.

1595
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,430
And one of the
things you see is all

1596
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,140
of the work we've
done in the community

1597
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,557
for the last few decades has
been done at room temperature

1598
01:18:40,557 --> 01:18:43,120
because it's really hard
to irradiate things cold.

1599
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,470
And here is all the irradiation.

1600
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:47,820
Here's how things
degrade when it's cold.

1601
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,290
And, when things are
cold, they degrade 60%

1602
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,280
faster than they
normally degrade.

1603
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,280
So all of the work we've
done to date has just

1604
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,530
been upended by this
result. Putting things

1605
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:58,420
in the right environment,
doing it quickly

1606
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:03,230
gets us answers that we
need to better design for.

1607
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:05,240
The last facility I
want to talk about

1608
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,560
is, how do we deal with
structural materials?

1609
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,080
So we have a new
technique that's

1610
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,830
been developed here where we can
actually use very high intensity

1611
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,780
proton beams at higher energy.

1612
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:17,460
We can irradiate bulk
material specimens.

1613
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,080
And we get a bunch
of advantages.

1614
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,870
OK, we can actually change
the energy of the beam.

1615
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,650
We can modify the type
of damage that we're

1616
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,220
introducing to materials.

1617
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,220
We can do this in
bulk specimens, which

1618
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:32,000
means we can put those materials
into things like tensile tests.

1619
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,615
Instead of doing TEM imaging
and looking at micrographs

1620
01:19:34,615 --> 01:19:35,990
and other things,
we can actually

1621
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:38,780
get engineering property
data, things engineers

1622
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:41,020
want to design materials.

1623
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,660
And so, right now,
my last slide,

1624
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,510
the PSFC is gearing up to
basically build a completely new

1625
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:50,030
facility, a "first of a kind"
facility that will be major,

1626
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,510
which is actually leveraging
a lot of the advantages

1627
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:56,470
of the infrastructure at MIT and
the expertise to basically build

1628
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:59,410
a facility that'll damage
materials 100 times faster than

1629
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,200
the application and hundreds
times faster than things like

1630
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,350
IFMIF, big device I showed you
that might be operational in 20

1631
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:06,170
years.

1632
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:09,010
And we can actually do this
with off-the-shelf technology.

1633
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:11,220
And we can have this thing
running in 18 months.

1634
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,390
OK we can end up
with beamlines that

1635
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:15,590
are doing lots of different
kinds of irradiation.

1636
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:17,530
We can do them in
complex environments

1637
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:19,420
where you irradiate
material in contact

1638
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,170
with that hot liquid metal.

1639
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:24,190
So we can investigate
corrosion, radiation challenges.

1640
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:27,142
And I think, most importantly,
given the time scales that we've

1641
01:20:27,142 --> 01:20:28,600
been talking about,
we can get data

1642
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,930
to companies that need it in the
span of years, not in decades.

1643
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,264
Thanks.

1644
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:37,673
[AUDIENCE]

1645
01:20:37,673 --> 01:20:44,500

1646
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,020
OK.

1647
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,040
Hi, everyone.

1648
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:46,800
I'm Cristina Rea.

1649
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,090
I'm a principal research
scientist at the PSFC.

1650
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:54,590
so [INAUDIBLE] damages
that Zach introduced.

1651
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:56,420
I'm going to talk
about disruptions.

1652
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:00,250
So fusion plasmas, we
have to confine them

1653
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:03,710
at very high temperature, high
densities, hotter than the sun.

1654
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:09,970
And so we assisted highly
nonlinear [INAUDIBLE]

1655
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:13,570
interactions and the
interactions of the plasma

1656
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:17,140
with the device that
is confining it.

1657
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:20,320
Sometimes, we are unable to
control the plasma because

1658
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,700
of the growth of instabilities.

1659
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,688
And what can happen?

1660
01:21:23,688 --> 01:21:25,480
So we are looking now
at the plasma and not

1661
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,180
necessarily at the hardware
issues, the material issues.

1662
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:34,340
So what happens now is that
we can incur in disruptions.

1663
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,030
So the final disruptions
can be defined

1664
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:40,460
as a sudden loss of control.

1665
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,840
And I wanted to show you this
time series from the Alcator

1666
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,550
C-Mod experiment that we were
hosting at the MIT Plasma

1667
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,480
Science and Fusion
Center until 2016.

1668
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,910
And the space will be
reused for the facility

1669
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:54,320
that Zach was mentioning.

1670
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,370
So here are normal
plasma operations.

1671
01:21:58,370 --> 01:21:59,980
So, typically,
during experiments,

1672
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,220
we ramp up the current.

1673
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:02,920
We conduct our experiments.

1674
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,700
And then we ramp it down safely.

1675
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:08,410
But what disruptions mean is
that this fast loss of control

1676
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,270
evolves on timescales
of milliseconds.

1677
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:14,050
And suddenly all current
and temperatures drop.

1678
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:18,100
And this leads to the loss of
a confining poloidal field.

1679
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,880
The current
transients, basically,

1680
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,210
in turn, induce large
forces and currents.

1681
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,970
And the rapid
thermal loss that can

1682
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,040
occur on some
milliseconds timescales

1683
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,710
can also induce thermal
damages and surface damages.

1684
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:37,850
So time series are what
I work day to day with.

1685
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:42,230
But it's useful to take a
look at in what it means,

1686
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:44,090
like from the point
of view of a video.

1687
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:50,340
Here we are looking at
video, which used to work.

1688
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,175
And maybe it works?

1689
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,710

1690
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,390
Here, yeah.

1691
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:59,080
This is a camera
view from the-- we

1692
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,950
are looking at the inside of
the Alcator C-Mod tokamak.

1693
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,400
That is the central solenoid.

1694
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,450
The plasma is heating up.

1695
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,630
And then, at some
point, it disrupts.

1696
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,150
What you see there
are materials that

1697
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:14,000
are being eroded off the walls,
as Zach was mentioning before.

1698
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,310
And the growth of
such instabilities

1699
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:18,890
that are occurring when
the plasma is pushed

1700
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:20,930
to beyond the
controllability limits

1701
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:24,540
that's associated to the
occurrence of disruptions.

1702
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:29,750
So the direct cause
is melting of surfaces

1703
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:33,230
that are enclosing the plasma.

1704
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:35,030
In current
experiments, what we do

1705
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:38,330
is typically we accept the
damage, we live with it,

1706
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:40,340
and we continue to
run our experiments

1707
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,960
to improve the operational
spaces of stability.

1708
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,430
But, when we want to optimize
our plasma performances, what

1709
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:50,000
we try to do is to mitigate
the damage by radiating away as

1710
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,150
much and as fast as possible.

1711
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:56,510
Going forward, we really need
to work on disruption prevention

1712
01:23:56,510 --> 01:24:00,500
strategies in order to
reduce the disruption

1713
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,530
rate and the disruption risk.

1714
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:05,480
And this means detecting
the precursor stages

1715
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,780
and steering the plasma away
from the disruptive boundary

1716
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,900
to interpret both metrics.

1717
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,450
One tricky thing is
that disruptions are not

1718
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:17,480
necessarily well described
from first principle models.

1719
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:21,050
However, we've been operating
these devices for years

1720
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:24,140
and years, and so we have
available a huge amount

1721
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,370
of experimental data.

1722
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:27,950
And so our team,
at the PSFC, has

1723
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:30,050
been looking into data-driven
and machine learning

1724
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:32,900
models, which can provide
an explainable proximity

1725
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,920
to the unstable
operational space.

1726
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,010
Here, in the top panel,
you can see again

1727
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,110
the plasma current time
trace with the disruption

1728
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:40,190
of terrain over here.

1729
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,560
And then overlaid, there
is a blue time trace

1730
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,520
which was obtained through
a machine learning model

1731
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,920
that is tracking the approaching
of the unstable operational

1732
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:50,420
space.

1733
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,400
And it's giving a
warning that a disruption

1734
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,430
is about to happen several
hundred of milliseconds

1735
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,620
before the disruption.

1736
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,510
This basically
enables us to take--

1737
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,920
this was run in open loop.

1738
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,040
So there was no action and
no intervention steering

1739
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,860
the plasma away from
this instability limit.

1740
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,650
But it gives us confidence
that we can actually

1741
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:12,470
do experiments and maintain
the plasma stability

1742
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:15,200
and expand the
plasma survivability.

1743
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,160
In the top-- in
the bottom panel,

1744
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:21,920
you can see also that we are
able to design algorithms that

1745
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,690
are interpretable,
that are explainable,

1746
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,340
and that we can design.

1747
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:28,520
We can extract important
features and contributions

1748
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,170
to disruptivity
relativity that are

1749
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:32,720
useful information for
the plasma control system

1750
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,990
to maintain and preserve
the [INAUDIBLE] itself.

1751
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:39,090
And, indeed, if we
design these algorithms

1752
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,700
and we close the
loop in real time,

1753
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,930
we are actually able to
demonstrate that the plasma

1754
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,620
survivability can be extended.

1755
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:50,090
This is another example from
a grad student work that I'm

1756
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:51,570
working with, Andrew Maris.

1757
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:53,570
And we ran an experiment
last summer time

1758
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:57,090
at [INAUDIBLE], where we found
the collisionality at the plasma

1759
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:00,090
edge as an indicator
of a disruption

1760
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,260
risk for a certain
type of disruption.

1761
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,560
We were tracking
this in real time.

1762
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,520
And, without the
controller in the loop,

1763
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,470
you could see that the
plasma disrupts here

1764
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,700
at around 3.5 seconds.

1765
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:15,570
And, instead with the controller
on, we can extend the lifetime

1766
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:23,300
and improve on the plasma
[INAUDIBLE] and the stability.

1767
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,280
ML is great, but
we really need data

1768
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:31,610
to basically build these
models and define these models

1769
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:33,005
in an accurate way.

1770
01:26:33,005 --> 01:26:35,630
And so an additional example of
the work that the team is doing

1771
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:40,010
is working on interoperable
and open source libraries that

1772
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:43,370
are available for
retrieving quickly

1773
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:45,770
data across many
different fusion devices.

1774
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,570
And this actually
enables the assembly

1775
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,160
of big databases for machine
learning applications.

1776
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,060
We've just released this
product a couple of weeks ago,

1777
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,980
and it's called
Disruption [? Pi. ?]

1778
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:56,720
Connects to different
data repositories

1779
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,730
across different tokamak
experimental devices

1780
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,270
and prepares these [INAUDIBLE].

1781
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,820
And this is really an
enabling instrument

1782
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,960
because ML model development
is just the tip of the iceberg

1783
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,990
while the data
preparation part is really

1784
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:13,280
like what is [INAUDIBLE].

1785
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:17,180
The disruptions team at
the PSFC is really big,

1786
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:20,030
includes more than 20 people
between scientists, postdocs

1787
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:21,440
and students and collaborators.

1788
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,190
And ML and AI tools are
really used ubiquitously

1789
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:26,670
across many different projects.

1790
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:29,150
I was able to just give
an example of a couple

1791
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,650
active projects.

1792
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:34,370
We have notable
collaborations with CFS

1793
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:39,770
where we are really working
towards the disruption

1794
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:41,990
prevention strategies for SPARC.

1795
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,545
And we are partnering also
with any ENI and the data

1796
01:27:45,545 --> 01:27:46,530
science [INAUDIBLE].

1797
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:48,825
And, also, we have
collaborators [INAUDIBLE].

1798
01:27:48,825 --> 01:27:52,500

1799
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,270
The widely spread
use of ML and AI

1800
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,400
tools at the Plasma
Science and Fusion Center

1801
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,780
basically earned the plasma--

1802
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,640
the designation of a
collaborating center,

1803
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,660
an IEA collaborating
center in AI and Fusion

1804
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,760
and Plasma Science
around the topics

1805
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,090
of research and education.

1806
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:09,990
So this is a five-year
cost-free agreement

1807
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:11,320
that we signed last year.

1808
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:15,790
It builds on already actively
funded grants that we have,

1809
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:19,260
and it revolves around three
main pillars, so development

1810
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:22,710
of open science and fair
access to fusion data

1811
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:26,350
and metadata information for
preservation and provenance,

1812
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:30,270
tracking, the dissemination of
accessible research products

1813
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:32,310
to enable cross-pollination
among communities

1814
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:35,700
and accelerate the development
of fusion research,

1815
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,730
and education training
and capacity building

1816
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,350
in applied fusion science.

1817
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:43,230
So we can work towards
a diversified workforce

1818
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:46,231
to accelerate progress
towards [INAUDIBLE].

1819
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:48,706
And that was my last.

1820
01:28:48,706 --> 01:28:52,192
[AUDIENCE]

1821
01:28:52,192 --> 01:29:07,493

1822
01:29:07,493 --> 01:29:09,410
Yeah, so we're going to
talk a little bit more

1823
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,250
about the tritium aspects that
have come up a few times so

1824
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,050
far during this session.

1825
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:18,005
So, as you may have heard
or you may already know,

1826
01:29:18,005 --> 01:29:19,970
most of the proposed
fusion power plant

1827
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,800
concepts that is
being pursued right

1828
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,070
now by the private industry
will use deuterium and tritium

1829
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:25,785
as fuel.

1830
01:29:25,785 --> 01:29:28,160
So, just as a recap, if you
were to zoom into that plasma

1831
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,450
to see the particles
that are fusing,

1832
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,830
you have a deuterium nucleus, a
deuteron, and a tritium nucleus,

1833
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:34,580
a triton.

1834
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,200
And those fuse, and
then this results

1835
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,615
in a very high-energy neutron.

1836
01:29:37,615 --> 01:29:39,090
So that's 14 MeV.

1837
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,450
So that's about
seven times higher

1838
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:44,940
than the fastest neutrons you
would see in a fission spectrum.

1839
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:49,320
And then helium ash,
also pretty high energy.

1840
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,940
So tritium is scarce.

1841
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:51,940
Deuterium is not.

1842
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:53,502
But tritium is
very, very scarce.

1843
01:29:53,502 --> 01:29:55,710
And so we know that we're
going to have to figure out

1844
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:59,460
how to breed our own using
the neutrons that come off

1845
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,230
of the plasma fusion reaction.

1846
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,208
So, over there, on the
left, in the arrow,

1847
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:06,000
you can see, in the
plasma, just a reminder

1848
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,210
of what that reaction is.

1849
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:10,870
D plus T yields a high-energy
neutron and an alpha particle.

1850
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:12,420
And then we can
capture that neutron

1851
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,860
in the blanket that
surrounds the plasma core.

1852
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:17,020
So we refer to this often
just as the blanket,

1853
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:19,840
but you also hear the
terminology breeder blanket.

1854
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,140
And so this reaction
is going to be

1855
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:25,290
lithium interacting with a
neutron to produce tritium

1856
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,550
and then some combination
of other things.

1857
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,700
But tritium is the
important part there.

1858
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,500
The breeding blanket also has
other important functions.

1859
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,990
So this includes shielding.

1860
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,255
The blanket moderates
and absorbs neutrons,

1861
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:37,630
and this helps
shield the magnet.

1862
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:39,935
So that's very important to
the longevity of the plant.

1863
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,060
If the blanket wasn't there,
it would be much, much

1864
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,250
harder to extract
useful lifetime out

1865
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,710
of the magnets and
the other components.

1866
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:48,550
Heat capture, that's a big one.

1867
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,218
So that heat carried
by the neutrons,

1868
01:30:50,218 --> 01:30:52,010
we're going to capture
that in the blanket.

1869
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:54,260
That's how we're actually
going to generate our power.

1870
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,240
And then, finally,
the tritium breeding,

1871
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,180
which is one of the
major focuses right now

1872
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:01,130
of the US fusion technology
research community.

1873
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:03,320
So this is making more
fuel in that breeder.

1874
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,050
So it's going to
contain lithium.

1875
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:08,020
And the neutron from the plasma
interacts with the lithium

1876
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:11,170
to get tritium that we can, in
theory, extract and then use

1877
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:12,520
again as fuel.

1878
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,420
So there's multiple
forms of lithium

1879
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:18,250
that you are--
lithium-containing materials

1880
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,780
that you can choose for
your breeder blanket.

1881
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:22,420
So conventional
blankets frequently

1882
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:24,980
will use various
lithium ceramic solids.

1883
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,010
There's at least
20 or 30 that have

1884
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:31,100
been studied in the literature
over the last 50 years or so.

1885
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,390
Here, a liquid lithium.

1886
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:36,500
This is one that is being
pursued potentially by the UK,

1887
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,670
has the disadvantage of
being very chemically

1888
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:41,000
reactive with moisture.

1889
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,450
So a big safety issue,
but very good breeding

1890
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,810
because all of your volume
is just breeder material.

1891
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:49,490
Molten lead-lithium, this is
a very popular one right now.

1892
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:51,350
And then molten
salts like FLIBe.

1893
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:54,010
So FLIBe is the current one
that has a lot of interest

1894
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:55,010
in the fusion community.

1895
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,700
This is the primary breeder
material being pursued

1896
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,213
by Commonwealth Fusion Systems.

1897
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:01,130
Although, I want to
reiterate, none of these--

1898
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:03,828
there's no obvious winner
for breeder blankets.

1899
01:32:03,828 --> 01:32:05,870
We might wind up developing
many different kinds.

1900
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:07,820
You might see many
different kinds deployed,

1901
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,470
but, also, crucially, no one has
demonstrated a working breeding

1902
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:14,410
blanket in a prototypic
environment at scale.

1903
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:16,630
So even though some
of these concepts

1904
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,470
have more research
behind them than others,

1905
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:20,480
it's really anyone's game.

1906
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,280
There's no obvious winner yet.

1907
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,016
So beryllium and lead,
you'll see these a lot.

1908
01:32:27,016 --> 01:32:29,900
Beryllium in the
FLIBe, lead lithium.

1909
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:33,070
There's also certain fluoride
lithium salts that contain lead.

1910
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:35,450
These are important because
they're neutron multipliers.

1911
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:37,870
So a neutron that hits one of
these that doesn't interact

1912
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:41,690
with lithium is going to usually
go into an end-to-end reaction.

1913
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,690
And what this means is
it gives you a nice boost

1914
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:46,135
to your tritium
breeding in the blanket.

1915
01:32:46,135 --> 01:32:47,510
As you're designing
your blanket,

1916
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:49,552
you also need to be thinking
about infrastructure

1917
01:32:49,552 --> 01:32:52,000
for chemistry control
and heat removal.

1918
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,100
And, importantly, if you have
to think about one metric,

1919
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,820
if you're listening to talks
about breeder blankets,

1920
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:00,160
they're going to talk about
the tritium breeding ratio.

1921
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,200
And they're almost always going
to just abbreviate this to TBR.

1922
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,580
And the TBR is very simple.

1923
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,288
It's just a number of
tritons that you're

1924
01:33:06,288 --> 01:33:09,280
producing over the number of
tritons that are being consumed.

1925
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,740
And the TBR that
you need for a plant

1926
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:13,630
to be tritium
self-sufficient is going

1927
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:15,988
to vary based on a lot
of different parameters.

1928
01:33:15,988 --> 01:33:18,280
And that's going to be governed
by everything from just

1929
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,300
the straight-up geometry of the
plant and its power production

1930
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,640
targets to different
operating decisions

1931
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,280
and design choices that the
operating company has made.

1932
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,430
So this is not a
set-in-stone thing.

1933
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:33,310
Sometimes you'll hear people say
that you just need a TBR of 1

1934
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:36,310
or a TBR of like 1.05,
so a little bit of margin

1935
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,580
for uncertainties.

1936
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:38,840
And that's not true.

1937
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,630
So if you were a
power plant designer,

1938
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:44,170
you really want to think about
your entire fuel cycle system

1939
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:47,200
and make sure that you know,
what is the minimum TBR you

1940
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,050
need to achieve?

1941
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:50,500
And then also, is your
blanket able to achieve that?

1942
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,080
Because there's going
to be some upper maximum

1943
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:56,410
theoretical limit on the
TBR that any given blanket

1944
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:58,630
can achieve based on the
power output of the plant

1945
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,990
and the geometry of the blanket.

1946
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:03,630
It's really just it's a
straight-up neutronics problem.

1947
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:05,530
So we are investigating
molten salt,

1948
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:08,210
liquid immersion blankets for
the ARC class fusion power

1949
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:08,710
plant.

1950
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,950
This is the concept that
is being put forward

1951
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:13,050
by Commonwealth Fusion Systems.

1952
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,410
So the liquid immersion blanket
abbreviated usually to LIB,

1953
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:18,810
it's basically a giant
tank of molten salt

1954
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:22,440
in which the tokamak
containing the plasma

1955
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:26,110
is sort of suspended or held.

1956
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:27,900
And so the reason that
we want to do this

1957
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,998
is that it's very simple.

1958
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:31,290
So, in theory, you're going
to get some cost and design

1959
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:33,660
savings just in terms of
the structural materials

1960
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:36,390
and the manifolds that you need.

1961
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:39,090
You maximize solid
angle coverage this way

1962
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,260
of your plasma neutron source.

1963
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,060
So, again, just coming
back to neutronics,

1964
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,480
I want every neutron to
interact with breeder and not

1965
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,685
with a nonbreeding
structural material if I can.

1966
01:34:48,685 --> 01:34:50,310
That's also going to
give me advantages

1967
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,678
for activation purposes.

1968
01:34:52,678 --> 01:34:54,220
The gives you
efficient heat removal,

1969
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,190
very important for
high energy density

1970
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,260
concepts like ARC
and the ability

1971
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,740
to have online
chemistry control.

1972
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:02,050
So conventional blankets have
a lot of research behind them,

1973
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:03,592
but they tend to
have a lot of really

1974
01:35:03,592 --> 01:35:04,940
complex, solid structures.

1975
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,930
And this is going to give
you activation concerns,

1976
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:12,230
lower TBR, and also challenges
for maintenance as well.

1977
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:14,720
So the high-breeding
efficiency of the LIB

1978
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,520
is important because
this is going

1979
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,830
to let us do doubling
of the tritium inventory

1980
01:35:18,830 --> 01:35:20,870
a lot faster in a plant.

1981
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:22,430
So conventional
blankets, we expect

1982
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:24,750
to have a doubling
time of about 10 years,

1983
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,250
meaning that the
time it takes-- you

1984
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:28,083
have a certain start
up inventory of tritium

1985
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:29,090
that your plant needs.

1986
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,900
And you need to double that
because if you're a company,

1987
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,983
you're going to want to
build more than one fusion

1988
01:35:32,983 --> 01:35:33,950
power plant.

1989
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:37,290
And so if we were to use
conventional blanket technology,

1990
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:41,255
it would take us like over
70 years just to reach--

1991
01:35:41,255 --> 01:35:43,130
from the time that you
start deploying fusion

1992
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,470
to reach a tenth of a terawatt.

1993
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:47,345
So that is not the type
of energy penetration

1994
01:35:47,345 --> 01:35:49,387
that we've been talking
about when we talk about,

1995
01:35:49,387 --> 01:35:50,130
why do fusion?

1996
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:52,920
So even if you were to solve
every other technical problem,

1997
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,840
if you didn't make
a better blanket,

1998
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,710
you were going to be inherently
limiting your industry.

1999
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,495
So, just as sort of--

2000
01:35:59,495 --> 01:36:01,730
our LIBRA experiment
at MIT is what

2001
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:05,630
we are doing to advance molten
breeder salt blanket technology.

2002
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:08,210
So this is basically trying
to use a GT commercial neutron

2003
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:10,100
generator to get a
prototypic neutron

2004
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,360
spectrum in representative
temperature,

2005
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,660
molten-applied
salt. So this is not

2006
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:18,120
going to be the same fluence
as a fusion power plant.

2007
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,620
But everything else
is quite similar

2008
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,150
chemically and neutronically.

2009
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:24,390
And this lets us really
understand how tritium

2010
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:26,310
is going to behave in FLIBe.

2011
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:28,140
We're doing a staged
experimental approach

2012
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:30,600
going from small to
much larger volumes

2013
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,175
due to the technical challenges
as well as the safety

2014
01:36:33,175 --> 01:36:34,800
challenges that are
inherent in working

2015
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,320
with high-temperature materials
containing HF and beryllium.

2016
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:41,660
So this is really important
because there are enormous

2017
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,360
uncertainties regarding how
tritium behaves in FLIBe,

2018
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,790
a "3 to 4 order of magnitude"
spread for things like

2019
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:48,440
solubility, diffusivity.

2020
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,540
We need really good
information on this

2021
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:53,090
in order to design a
working power plant.

2022
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:56,180
We cannot go from this type of
spread in the data to a plant

2023
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,452
that we know will work.

2024
01:36:57,452 --> 01:36:58,910
So that's why it's
really important

2025
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:01,700
that we have experiments that
are designed for reliability

2026
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,470
and repeatability.

2027
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:04,970
I want to emphasize
that the breeder

2028
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:09,320
blanket is just one part of a
very complex fuel cycle system.

2029
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,503
We need to understand
how tritium behaves

2030
01:37:11,503 --> 01:37:13,920
throughout the entire fuel
cycle, so not just the blanket,

2031
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,190
but also extracting it,
purifying it, storing

2032
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,480
it, reinject it back
into the plasma.

2033
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,600
These are all pretty low TRL.

2034
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,880
So there's a lot of work ongoing
to advance these technologies.

2035
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,840
And so, just to
recap really quickly,

2036
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,490
the DT plants, you
want to remember,

2037
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:31,032
they need to breed
their own tritium.

2038
01:37:31,032 --> 01:37:33,210
So, for a given concept,
how are they doing that?

2039
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:35,420
What is their
breeder technology?

2040
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,130
Do they have a
concept that is going

2041
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:39,420
to double that inventory
at a fast enough time

2042
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:42,490
to ensure the success
of the Fusion Industry?

2043
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:45,090
And finally, here at MIT,
just down the street,

2044
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:48,570
we're undertaking a very
ambitious and staged approach.

2045
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:51,450
This is actively
underway at the PSFC.

2046
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:54,420
It's really exciting
work, and we are really

2047
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,950
looking forward to what comes
next out of this project.

2048
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:57,980
Thank you.

[AUDIENCE]

2050
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:13,190

2051
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:14,130
Hello, everybody.

2052
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:15,270
I'm Ethan Peterson.

2053
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:18,610
I'm an assistant professor in
nuclear science and engineering

2054
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:20,620
and at the Plasma Science
and Fusion Center.

2055
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:24,363
And neutrons, Sara
just said, again,

2056
01:38:24,363 --> 01:38:25,780
it all comes back
to the neutrons.

2057
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:27,050
And that's why I have a job.

2058
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:29,810
So we're going to talk entirely
about neutrons for the next five

2059
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:31,690
minutes, more or less.

2060
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:35,960
And how do these neutrons impact
fusion power plant design?

2061
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,850
Well, as you've heard
throughout the night,

2062
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:39,230
they impact it greatly.

2063
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:42,670
So the neutrons carry
80% of DT fusion energy.

2064
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:45,520
And we use Monte
Carlo simulations

2065
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,850
to calculate the distributions
or the populations

2066
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:51,610
of these neutrons everywhere
throughout the power plant.

2067
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:56,020
So they're born here at 14
MeV, and they scatter and lose

2068
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:00,130
their energy as they travel
down to the thermal range.

2069
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:03,940
However, I wrote here
that the mean free path

2070
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:07,360
or the average distance between
collisions for 14 MeV neutrons

2071
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,430
in steel is 5 centimeters.

2072
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:13,400
And it takes them 500
collisions to lose that energy.

2073
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,750
So what does this mean?

2074
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:18,140
This means that fusion
neutrons travel extremely far

2075
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:21,600
at high energy, and they cause
damage like Zach talked about.

2076
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,560
They heat things up.

2077
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,340
They cause dose.

2078
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,550
They transmute things,
and they produce reactions

2079
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:27,560
that make things
radioactive, which

2080
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,640
is what transmutation is here.

2081
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:33,810
And so, in the context of
designing a power plant,

2082
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,510
how does this affect us?

2083
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:38,577
Well, we have our plasma
here, and we have the neutrons

2084
01:39:38,577 --> 01:39:39,410
that are flying out.

2085
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:41,100
And we have a few
different subsystems.

2086
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,350
We have our magnets.

2087
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:45,600
We have a vacuum vessel that
has plasma-facing components.

2088
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:49,760
And one of the functions or
consequences of these neutrons

2089
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,530
is that we need to
capture their energy

2090
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:54,150
and generate tritium, which is
what Sara just talked about.

2091
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,900
But we also have to
protect these magnets.

2092
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,870
So they have very high energy.

2093
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:02,790
Neutrons, displace
atoms, cause damage,

2094
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:07,010
reduce the superconducting
qualities of the magnets.

2095
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:09,740
We also have to engineer
these plasma-facing components

2096
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:12,170
and structural materials
to be able to withstand

2097
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:15,230
high fluences of high-energy
neutron radiation.

2098
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:18,080
And we also have to protect
workers and the public

2099
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,220
from direct and shutdown dose.

2100
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:23,000
And so the fact that
all of these neutrons

2101
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,670
are traveling very far
through this reactor,

2102
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:29,000
they significantly impact
every single subsystem

2103
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,680
that goes into the power plant.

2104
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:35,610
And this manifests
itself in determining

2105
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:38,610
system requirements on every
single subsystem, more or less,

2106
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:39,870
in a fusion power plant.

2107
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:41,910
Yet neutronics
calculations often

2108
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,050
take the longest to execute.

2109
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:46,860
So this slows down the entire
design iteration process

2110
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:50,080
for every single fusion concept.

2111
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,740
And so what we need is
fast and accurate methods

2112
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:55,350
to compute the responses
of these neutrons

2113
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:56,952
and quantify their
uncertainties.

2114
01:40:56,952 --> 01:40:58,660
And we'll get to this
a little bit later.

2115
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,200
But the reason that we need to
quantify these uncertainties

2116
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,050
is so that we can set
accurate engineering margins

2117
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:07,020
because overly conservative
engineering margins are

2118
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,890
going to make your plant
totally economically unviable.

2119
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:14,400
So I'm going to walk
through a brief analysis

2120
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,280
that I like to do called the
shutdown dose rate, which

2121
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,717
is, essentially, the
dose worker would receive

2122
01:41:19,717 --> 01:41:21,300
going into the plant
to do maintenance

2123
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,290
after some time of operation.

2124
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:24,310
Call that the SDR.

2125
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:25,780
And so how do we get there?

2126
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,960
We start with our
neutron transport solve,

2127
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,820
calculating with our Monte Carlo
code where the neutrons go,

2128
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:32,210
what their populations are.

2129
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:35,020
And this requires some
inputs of nuclear data

2130
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:38,740
and some model definitions like
our little cute reactor concept

2131
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,440
up here.

2132
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,980
And what we do is we get
reaction rates, neutron reaction

2133
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:44,330
rates, and we do what we
call an activation solve,

2134
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:47,590
so how the atoms in
the whole power plant

2135
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:50,690
evolve and become
different atoms over time.

2136
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:53,470
And what that gives us is
activated material compositions,

2137
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:55,960
everywhere throughout
the whole power plant.

2138
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,930
And what this does is now
these activated radioactive

2139
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:02,540
compositions constitute photon
sources or gamma sources.

2140
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:05,290
And each of those
little bits of material

2141
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,670
have an associated
photon spectrum.

2142
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:09,220
And what we need to take--

2143
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:11,860
what we need to do is put that
photon spectrum into our Monte

2144
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:14,350
Carlo solver, do the
photon transport,

2145
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:17,800
and calculate this map of what
the dose would be for workers

2146
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,040
going into the power plant.

2147
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,850
And this seems all very,
very straightforward.

2148
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:24,880
And the reason I like to
highlight this sort of workflow

2149
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,840
is that, along the way, we get
all of the nuclear responses

2150
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:32,530
that we need to analyze or
assess any sort of subsystem

2151
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,710
in the fusion power plant.

2152
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:36,550
So, for example, from here
we get energy deposition,

2153
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:38,530
damage, tritium production.

2154
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:41,480
From this step, we get things
like waste disposal ratings.

2155
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,230
So how do you store some
of the radioactive material

2156
01:42:44,230 --> 01:42:46,510
that you've produced in
your fusion power plant.

2157
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:50,740
You also get just the
nuclide inventories

2158
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:53,480
and [INAUDIBLE]
produced over time.

2159
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:55,040
And then, from the
photon spectrums,

2160
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,500
we have radiation
sources that we

2161
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:59,560
need to account for when we're
moving them from place to place

2162
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,660
and do shielding analysis.

2163
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:04,150
Now, it would be great if
this was so streamlined,

2164
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:07,810
and it was just very clear that
you put your inputs into one

2165
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:09,770
code, and then you get
the shutdown dose rate,

2166
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:12,490
but what it actually looks like
right now in the current fusion

2167
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:15,220
neutronics ecosystem is
all of these barriers

2168
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,420
between these different
steps of the code.

2169
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:20,170
And these are different
codes maintained

2170
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:24,040
by different developers, many of
which are under export control.

2171
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,665
And, a lot of times,
the software plumbing,

2172
01:43:26,665 --> 01:43:28,540
which is what I call
these little arrows that

2173
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,520
go from place to place,
aren't maintained

2174
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,120
by any of those organizations.

2175
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,240
And so you could
imagine validating

2176
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,590
these types of workflows.

2177
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:38,320
And quality assuring
them is extremely

2178
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,960
challenging for something
that's critically

2179
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,030
important for a lot of safety
considerations and regulations.

2180
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:48,490
So these barriers, furthermore,
from a scientific and a research

2181
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:52,390
perspective, prevent our ability
to propagate the uncertainties

2182
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:55,310
that we need to propagate
from one step to the next.

2183
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:58,990
And so, ultimately, we can't
put rigorously determined

2184
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:02,350
engineering margins on
these types of calculations

2185
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:04,040
in the current ecosystem.

2186
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,820
And so what we've gone and done
over the last handful of years

2187
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:10,000
is to develop this entire
streamlined workflow

2188
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,980
within a single open
source code called

2189
01:44:11,980 --> 01:44:15,460
OpenMC, which was
invented here at MIT

2190
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:17,710
by a grad student
and his advisor,

2191
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:21,160
Ben Forget, the current head
of the Department of Nuclear

2192
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,280
Science and Engineering.

2193
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:26,980
And what this gains us is that
we have single sources of truth

2194
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:30,440
for nuclear data and for
all of our model inputs.

2195
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,690
And they're used by every
step along the process.

2196
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:36,880
And there's one source of
truth for all of these modules

2197
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,860
and the software plumbing
that's maintained

2198
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:42,610
by a single development
team, but it's also

2199
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:43,550
community developed.

2200
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:46,030
And that's one of
the big drivers

2201
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:48,760
that I think fusion
needs to latch on

2202
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,480
to is taking advantage
of collaborations

2203
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:56,540
and community-driven
projects like this to deliver

2204
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:01,540
high-performance engineering
tools for the design of fusion

2205
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:02,450
power plants.

2206
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:08,610
And so, yeah, let's see
what's the endpoint of this.

2207
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:09,628
Well, we'll keep going.

2208
01:45:09,628 --> 01:45:12,440

2209
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:17,090
To end, the goal here is to
build an analysis platform that

2210
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,340
provides us all of the
nuclear analysis end

2211
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:21,350
points in the design
of a fusion power plant

2212
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:25,010
and to make this streamlined,
user-friendly, high performance,

2213
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:28,130
and allow us to propagate
these uncertainties to deliver

2214
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:30,270
engineering margins
on these power plants.

2215
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:34,850
And so, here, I've made this
cartoon plot of some example

2216
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,350
fusion neutronics
analysis that I've

2217
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:38,660
pulled from the
literature for devices

2218
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,980
of varying size and complexity.

2219
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:42,743
And the discrepancy
here is what I'm

2220
01:45:42,743 --> 01:45:44,660
calling the difference
between what we compute

2221
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:46,680
and what we measure
in the experiment.

2222
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:49,250
And it's not uncommon
to get factors

2223
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:52,890
of 10 difference between what we
measure and what we calculate.

2224
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:56,990
And because neutrons touch every
subsystem in the fusion power

2225
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:58,770
plant, that's untenable.

2226
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:03,500
And, basically, if you're
carrying 10x engineering

2227
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,150
margins, many, many places
throughout your design,

2228
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:07,410
it's not going to work out.

2229
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:09,650
And so what this
ultimately means

2230
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:13,000
is that, to have confidence in
our predictive modeling tools,

2231
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,450
we need to find better
agreement between experiments

2232
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:18,550
and simulations for these
very large, complex systems.

2233
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:19,980
So bringing
something that trends

2234
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,410
like this down to something
that trends like this

2235
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:26,700
so that we can actually
design systems effectively.

2236
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:29,728
So that's the end of my talk.

2237
01:46:29,728 --> 01:46:33,200
[AUDIENCE]

2238
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:51,056

2239
01:46:51,056 --> 01:46:53,250
I think we're running
later than we should.

2240
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:56,600
And that's entirely my fault.
I think I spoke for way more

2241
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,280
than I should have.

2242
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:04,950
So should we see if there are
questions from the audience

2243
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:06,520
so that we don't
run out of time?

2244
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,220

2245
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:13,957
And, Dennis, it would be very
awkward for you not to be here.

2246
01:47:13,957 --> 01:47:16,290
So everybody should consider--
everybody should consider

2247
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:18,450
Dennis White as
part of this panel

2248
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:21,683
as well, if you'll be so kind.

2249
01:47:21,683 --> 01:47:22,850
Questions from the audience.

2250
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:30,800

2251
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,410
He loves to answer them.

2252
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:36,440
I can suggest a slightly
provocatory one,

2253
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:40,420
and that is the question
of whether fusion, energy

2254
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:44,470
and fusion science is worth
pursuing even if this study were

2255
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:48,970
to conclude that it will
never be economically viable?

2256
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:50,900
And I have my own
answer to this.

2257
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:54,020
And I'm actually-- this
is not a planted question.

2258
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:58,230
I actually am genuinely curious
to see what people think.

2259
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:01,890
Well, let me give you
the perspective for why

2260
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:03,942
the answer might still be yes.

2261
01:48:03,942 --> 01:48:07,100
So, for example, one
thing I work on right

2262
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:09,530
now is developing
quantum algorithms

2263
01:48:09,530 --> 01:48:12,060
for solving plasma equations.

2264
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,330
And it turns out that the
fusion community is actually

2265
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:18,930
arguably the most advanced
community in science

2266
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:22,470
and engineering at actually
trying to answer this question.

2267
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:25,320
Can one solve nonlinear
partial differential equations

2268
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,180
on a quantum [INAUDIBLE]?

2269
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:29,400
Now, I'm interested in this
because of plasma physics

2270
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:30,300
and fusion.

2271
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,160
But nonlinear partial
differential equations

2272
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:35,960
are not the exclusive property
of plasmas [INAUDIBLE].

2273
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,570
Like many fields, arguably, we
all feel at MIT [INAUDIBLE] that

2274
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:43,170
are worth their salt--

2275
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:44,760
I'm going to say this live--

2276
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,900
require nonlinear PDEs.

2277
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:50,850
And so we're sort of seeing
that the algorithms that we

2278
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:55,140
are promoting for how to solve
nonlinear PDEs on a quantum

2279
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:58,950
computer are actually of
interest across board.

2280
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:03,330
So that's, for
example, one idea that

2281
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:07,470
started in fusion, which I'm
sure we'll see many applications

2282
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:09,735
in different systems.

2283
01:49:09,735 --> 01:49:13,760
But I wonder if, in materials,
in machine learning,

2284
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,820
in the neutronic
calculations, in blanket

2285
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:17,680
designs and
elsewhere, we're going

2286
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,232
to see similar ramifications.

2287
01:49:20,232 --> 01:49:21,440
Dennis, you had your hand up.

2288
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:25,530

2289
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:28,140
As a species, I would
argue that we always need

2290
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,740
to keep challenging ourselves.

2291
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:35,360
So you saw how hard it is, by
the way, of these four talks.

2292
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,580
It is not a cakewalk to make
fusion economic and viable.

2293
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:41,260
It is going to be
very difficult.

2294
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:43,767
And, honestly, we don't
know all of the impediments

2295
01:49:43,767 --> 01:49:44,350
along the way.

2296
01:49:44,350 --> 01:49:47,380
They're pretty well
characterized now,

2297
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,785
but we've got to be honest
about-- we should do that.

2298
01:49:49,785 --> 01:49:51,660
And the reason that we
do it is because, when

2299
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:55,756
we try really, really hard
things, we find out new things.

2300
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:59,070
And I think a great example of
that-- because you alluded to it

2301
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:01,980
very quickly was
the geothermal work,

2302
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:05,550
is that namely heating
these exotic plasmas

2303
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:07,560
is very difficult.
And we were forced

2304
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,980
to invent some very exotic
kinds of technologies.

2305
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,450
And it turns out--

2306
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:15,720
called gyrotrons which
produce very intense

2307
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:18,840
submillimeter wave Rf.

2308
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,240
This looks like it
actually has some chance

2309
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,720
of providing deep bore
drilling capabilities

2310
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,510
for advanced geothermal.

2311
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:28,900
Would you have
ever imagined that?

2312
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,060
That's why we should keep
doing this is because--

2313
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:33,190
we should keep pursuing
this because it's

2314
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:38,380
at the frontier of our
knowledge and our capabilities.

2315
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,620
[INAUDIBLE]

2316
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:43,330
I think we were--

2317
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:45,140
I mean, for what,
like 30, 40 years,

2318
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:48,280
I don't think we thought that
fusion had an economic outlook.

2319
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,235
And we still pursued it anyways.

2320
01:50:50,235 --> 01:50:51,610
And I think a lot
of great things

2321
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:56,130
have come out of
[INAUDIBLE] incredible,

2322
01:50:56,130 --> 01:50:57,730
just from a science perspective.

2323
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:01,740
I think we still value that
inherently, regardless.

2324
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:03,960
And the HTS
superconductor, which

2325
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,780
really is why we're on
this accelerated path.

2326
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:10,410
Let's be honest because it's
the most science-knowing path

2327
01:51:10,410 --> 01:51:12,588
that we're on didn't
come from fusion.

2328
01:51:12,588 --> 01:51:14,130
It came from some
material scientists

2329
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:17,320
doing incredible discovery
and advancements themselves.

2330
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:18,930
And that's the cool thing about.

2331
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:22,110
And it's, actually, I
think, why MIT succeeds

2332
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:24,150
so well in something like this.

2333
01:51:24,150 --> 01:51:27,480
It comes from surprises and
multidisciplinary connections

2334
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:30,900
that actually allow us to
make those deep innovations.

2335
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:32,920
I didn't answer your
question directly.

2336
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,100
And it was on-- maybe
it was Randy's slide.

2337
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,030
Or maybe Bob's slide.

2338
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:41,040
But the report doesn't
predict what fusion will cost.

2339
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,090
And it doesn't predict
when fusion will happen.

2340
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:45,580
And that's because it cannot.

2341
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:49,060
We cannot actually predict what
something will cost until we go

2342
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:51,560
out and do it in a
commercial environment.

2343
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:53,782
And so I think Dennis
and I have talked--

2344
01:51:53,782 --> 01:51:55,845
what's that?

2345
01:51:55,845 --> 01:51:58,440
Yeah, your air bands
are what Ethan showed.

2346
01:51:58,440 --> 01:51:59,380
They're 100x,.

2347
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,550
Who knows?

2348
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:01,930
And it's not just
the technology,

2349
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:03,805
it's the environment
that you're doing it in.

2350
01:52:03,805 --> 01:52:06,497
We cannot predict what will be
the environment in 50 years.

2351
01:52:06,497 --> 01:52:08,830
And, actually, something
Dennis and I have talked about,

2352
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:12,870
one of the exciting things about
starting CFS and seeing what

2353
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:16,110
happens with SPARC is not
actually a technology result

2354
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:20,490
or a physics result. It's that,
unlike every federally funded

2355
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:23,610
fusion program ever,
CFS will know intimately

2356
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:26,460
what it costs to the
dollar to deploy fusion

2357
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,450
technology in a commercial way.

2358
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:29,998
And we've never had that before.

2359
01:52:29,998 --> 01:52:32,040
So it'll actually be one
of the first data points

2360
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:35,052
we've ever had about what
fusion actually will cost.

2361
01:52:35,052 --> 01:52:35,885
And that's exciting.

2362
01:52:35,885 --> 01:52:41,660

2363
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:45,680
Coming from a famous exchange
with the leader of the largest

2364
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,330
fusion program in
the world that says

2365
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:49,700
this project was designed
that we will never know

2366
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:53,450
the cost of it, which I was--

2367
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:55,380
which was a
political expediency.

2368
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:57,650
But, actually, what this study--

2369
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:00,980
and which I tell to my
international fusion colleagues

2370
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:04,790
over and over again, if it
doesn't cost the right at the--

2371
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:07,560
come in at the right cost
point, no one's going to use it.

2372
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:12,462
And it's like this study
clearly showed actually that.

2373
01:53:12,462 --> 01:53:15,426
And another thing that might
pertinent to discuss quickly

2374
01:53:15,426 --> 01:53:19,810
is the choice that we made
here is highly curated.

2375
01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:22,360
We chose some of the
things that the PSFC's

2376
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:27,000
working on because they
are mission critical.

2377
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,592
But these aren't all the
mission critical things.

2378
01:53:29,592 --> 01:53:31,050
So perhaps we can
have a little bit

2379
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:33,630
of a discussion about what
else we could be doing

2380
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:35,516
if we had enough resources.

2381
01:53:35,516 --> 01:53:40,040

2382
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,600
Sky is the limit, yeah.

2383
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,280
[INAUDIBLE]

2384
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,110
[INAUDIBLE] go back to
the [INAUDIBLE] study.

2385
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:49,200
So, Dennis, you might be
the most appropriate to

2386
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:49,930
comment on that.

2387
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:52,680
But, I mean, in Zach's
work with the cyclotron, so

2388
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:55,110
building materials,
testing facilities,

2389
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:57,850
building an actual
fusion-prototypic neutron

2390
01:53:57,850 --> 01:53:58,350
source.

2391
01:53:58,350 --> 01:54:00,700
So this is an active
area in the US right now.

2392
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:03,100
We're doing the risk
reduction activity for that.

2393
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,940
But knowing that facility to
do what we would want to do

2394
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:08,940
is going to cost
around $1 billion,

2395
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:11,970
so we're very resource
limited in that regard.

2396
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:15,070
Better computational resources.

2397
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:16,520
[INAUDIBLE]

2398
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,770
Sure, we have
plenty of questions

2399
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:21,440
that are unsolved
through which we

2400
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:26,450
would benefit by partnering with
industry partners that are--

2401
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:30,990
whose computational problems
are day-to-day problems.

2402
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:32,570
They are addressing
those problems

2403
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,990
in day-to-day solutions.

2404
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:38,200
So, yeah, that's
definitely [INAUDIBLE].

2405
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:38,700
OK.

2406
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:39,200
Go back?

2407
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,140
Yeah, I agree with
all of these points.

2408
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:44,250
If they go back to something
that Nuno had mentioned earlier

2409
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:47,100
in the talk about the importance
of training the fusion

2410
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:48,750
workforce, I feel
like even if we

2411
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:51,510
had a windfall of billions
and billions of dollars,

2412
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:55,560
we wouldn't be able to
functionally spend it correctly

2413
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:59,130
because we don't have the people
or the educators currently

2414
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:01,346
in the system.

2415
01:55:01,346 --> 01:55:03,960
Inspired from this
study, in fact,

2416
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:05,415
with Layla, who
we had mentioned,

2417
01:55:05,415 --> 01:55:07,290
who was one of the
contributors to the study,

2418
01:55:07,290 --> 01:55:10,830
then she and I actually
started putting together

2419
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:16,760
a generalized cost
effectiveness or economic model

2420
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,280
that showed about-- is generic
to any kind of fusion concept.

2421
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,360
And what it was indicating is
that the key global parameters

2422
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:27,290
were power density and the
ability to change the damaged

2423
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,360
materials on a fast time scale.

2424
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:31,220
In the economic
sensitivity, these

2425
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:32,490
came out as the greatest ones.

2426
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:35,120
And I would point out
is that we tend to not

2427
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:37,490
think of those
because, in fact, those

2428
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:41,990
are two technical topics that
weren't directly mentioned

2429
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:44,900
in these, which is that the
higher you can get the power

2430
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:47,700
density globally is attractive.

2431
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:51,260
And then it could be
that we actually--

2432
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:53,880
as long as you know when the
materials are going to fail,

2433
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:56,840
we actually just replace
them quickly rather

2434
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,040
than thinking about them
lasting a long time.

2435
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,550
So I think there's
a whole set of--

2436
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:05,490
the way I look at
it, as we cast fusion

2437
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:09,850
into more of an economic
problem than a physics problem,

2438
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:11,490
we're going to start
actually revealing

2439
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:13,196
more of these challenges.

2440
01:56:13,196 --> 01:56:17,458

2441
01:56:17,458 --> 01:56:18,430
[INAUDIBLE]

2442
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:24,280

2443
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:27,040
So thank [INAUDIBLE].

2444
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,510
So thank you for your talk.

2445
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:32,320
It's a brilliant introduction
to fusion for those of us

2446
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:37,150
who are not very familiar
with the challenges.

2447
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:42,270
I saw on the slides mention of
the ITER experimental facility.

2448
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:44,080
It would be nice if
you could maybe--

2449
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:48,050
because this is a big challenge
that you're talking about.

2450
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:52,750
And I would maybe ask,
what kind of collaboration

2451
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,550
do you have with ITER?

2452
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:57,610
Because I know from different
readings and stuff that

2453
01:56:57,610 --> 01:56:59,560
they've been doing
some good stuff.

2454
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:04,750
So how do you describe working
together between Europe

2455
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,750
and the US on
something like this?

2456
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:10,440

2457
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:11,250
I can--

2458
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:12,030
OK.

2459
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:13,860
Are you going to
load this one on me?

2460
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:15,090
Jump under the gun, then.

2461
01:57:15,090 --> 01:57:16,220
Maybe Cristina.

2462
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:17,130
No, Cristina.

2463
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:19,930
No, yeah, we definitely
have strong relationship,

2464
01:57:19,930 --> 01:57:21,870
and we are providing
good contributions

2465
01:57:21,870 --> 01:57:24,090
to the ITER physics
spaces, which was actually

2466
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:27,310
instrumental to the development
of the SPARC physics spaces.

2467
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:32,010
So all the experience that we
gained by studying and preparing

2468
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:33,120
for ITER--

2469
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,520
[INAUDIBLE] is going to come
up if it's going to come up.

2470
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:40,140
It's been instrumental also for
returning risks on the physics,

2471
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:43,350
on some physics
aspects for SPARC.

2472
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:46,350
PSFC members are actively
involved in ITER research

2473
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:49,330
through the ITER expert
groups and topical groups.

2474
01:57:49,330 --> 01:57:54,390
So we join meetings
every couple of--

2475
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:58,060
yeah, twice a year
in different areas.

2476
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:00,780
We contribute to
specific investigations

2477
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:04,120
by gathering data points
on experimental devices,

2478
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:09,420
conducting modeling,
and connecting

2479
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:12,250
through the different
facilities internationally.

2480
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:16,050
So we are pretty much involved
in ITER research still.

2481
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:19,428
I think there's some tension on
the technology side with ITER.

2482
01:58:19,428 --> 01:58:20,470
It's not-- nothing's bad.

2483
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:23,430
We are really impressed
and supportive

2484
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:27,900
of the ITER and the demo
teams, demo being the general--

2485
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:31,890
the power plants that would
follow in the ITER concept.

2486
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:34,920
But one of the issues that we
encounter on the technology side

2487
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:36,620
is that-- so the demo
is based on ITER.

2488
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:38,500
And ITER was
started in the '80s.

2489
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,500
And so, when you start a
project and it has a 40-,

2490
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:45,720
50-year timeline to completion,
the world and technology is

2491
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:48,220
going to evolve
separately from you.

2492
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:50,863
And so the designs
of the power plants

2493
01:58:50,863 --> 01:58:52,530
that the private
industry is looking at,

2494
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:55,060
they're very, very different
than what ITER is looking at.

2495
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:57,430
And, as a result, we're taking
on different approaches,

2496
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,270
et cetera.

2497
01:58:58,270 --> 01:59:02,490
But the demo program in
Europe remains quite the same.

2498
01:59:02,490 --> 01:59:03,960
And so there's a
mix of things that

2499
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:07,350
are very relevant to us and then
other things that are just not.

2500
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:09,840
And I have found tension
in my own program

2501
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,830
is that the US has a sort of
standard commitment to ITER.

2502
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:17,130
And this is great, except
for the fact that we have

2503
01:59:17,130 --> 01:59:19,000
very limited funds available.

2504
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,970
So if you only have a pie that's
this big and most of the pie

2505
01:59:23,970 --> 01:59:26,650
has to be allocated
to ITER and demo,

2506
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:29,490
regardless of what the US
program is interested in,

2507
01:59:29,490 --> 01:59:33,540
that creates conflicts,
I guess, in terms

2508
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:35,500
of what priorities need to be.

2509
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,720
And, ideally, this goes
back to the blue sky thing,

2510
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:39,553
is that we would like
to be able to do both.

2511
01:59:39,553 --> 01:59:41,580
But we are resource-
and people-limited.

2512
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,090
And ITER is very important.

2513
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:46,780
First of all, it reminds
us, this is hard.

2514
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:51,150
And, in fact, SPARC is actually
the only other in construction

2515
01:59:51,150 --> 01:59:53,490
burning plasma
experiment, namely one

2516
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:55,510
that gets high energy
gain in the world.

2517
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:58,690
And SPARC is hard as well too.

2518
01:59:58,690 --> 02:00:02,040
And the quote-- because it's
sent back to me very often

2519
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,160
because I originated it.

2520
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:08,050
I said, so ITER has incredible
science interest and validity,

2521
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:11,500
but it is not
economically interesting

2522
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,790
because take the
cost point of it,

2523
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:16,840
and you can see about how much
it would cost per unit watt.

2524
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:19,900
It's so far off the
chart of what we just

2525
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:21,590
showed on the plots.

2526
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:24,820
So this is-- it almost goes back
to Nuno's original question is

2527
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:26,590
that, would we keep doing this?

2528
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:29,770
ITER, even though it didn't
have economic projection

2529
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:32,530
or viability, was an incredibly
worthwhile science project

2530
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:35,800
because it built the science
basis for what then we

2531
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:39,010
could actually launch,
actually, into this as well too.

2532
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:41,590
Programmatically, about
what it means as Fusion

2533
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:46,490
as an energy source is a
much more complex debate.

2534
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:49,130
But I think it is
already showing that it's

2535
02:00:49,130 --> 02:00:51,300
too slow and too expensive.

2536
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,220
And, in some sense,
ITER, unfortunately,

2537
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,790
can also be a counterexample
to people pointing to fusion

2538
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:58,710
and saying, look, we told
you it wasn't going to work.

2539
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:02,400
And I don't think that
that's the correct answer.

2540
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,128
Is that nice enough?

2541
02:01:04,128 --> 02:01:04,920
That was very good.

2542
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:05,880
[INAUDIBLE]

2543
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:15,490

2544
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:17,260
So this is a very
high-level question,

2545
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:19,100
and excuse its
complete ignorance,

2546
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:22,030
but I'm just trying to get an
idea in terms of proportionally,

2547
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:25,130
how much money is being spent
or has been allotted, say,

2548
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:29,500
relative to the space
program in the '60s.

2549
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,190
It's a small fraction of that.

2550
02:01:31,190 --> 02:01:34,180
Yeah, it's-- compared
to the-- yeah.

2551
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,620
Well, I mean, it's--

2552
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:37,030
no, I mean-- it's--

2553
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:39,500
cumulatively, compared
to the space program,

2554
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,300
it's probably
around 5%, something

2555
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:43,300
like that in the world
compared to what has been

2556
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:45,490
used for the space program.

2557
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:48,710
So I'm just going back
to Nuno's question.

2558
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:51,130
I mean, it would
seem like this would

2559
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:57,070
have similar importance to the
improvement of human existence.

2560
02:01:57,070 --> 02:02:00,250
Where's the money?

2561
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:01,640
That's-- yeah.

2562
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:02,530
We should end there.

2563
02:02:02,530 --> 02:02:05,050
Well, I mean, no, no, it is--

2564
02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:07,430
I mean, because
we're often asked.

2565
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:10,370
It's like, do we need an Apollo
program or something like this?

2566
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:12,520
It's actually-- I answer no.

2567
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,220
And the reason for
that is because this

2568
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:15,220
is a different kind of--

2569
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:17,920
I mean, I could argue ITER,
which is at the $50 billion

2570
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:21,490
scale, it's kind of an
Apollo-scale program.

2571
02:02:21,490 --> 02:02:24,670
Our end goal is actually
not to make fusion--

2572
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:26,540
just fusion science work.

2573
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:29,720
It's to make fusion as an
economic energy product.

2574
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:31,660
And so those things like the--

2575
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:33,320
was not that.

2576
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:35,140
And so, in many
ways, I think we're

2577
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:37,720
trying to make
more like a SpaceX,

2578
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:42,700
that, namely, it has roots in
those incredible accomplishments

2579
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:45,380
that were done in government
and public programs.

2580
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:48,080
But it has to have a goal
of economic viability.

2581
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:51,560
Otherwise, it's going to
impact in nobody's life ever.

2582
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:59,150
I would argue that the fusion
design space is enormous.

2583
02:02:59,150 --> 02:03:03,060
There are many possible
knobs, generally speaking.

2584
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:06,630
And it's very hard
to optimize anything

2585
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:10,980
if you basically have
two experiments or three

2586
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:11,710
in the world.

2587
02:03:11,710 --> 02:03:15,600
So we are not
sampling the space--

2588
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:17,340
nowhere close to
where we should be

2589
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:20,220
in terms of knowing
what it is that we

2590
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:23,130
do better so that we can
maximize fusion power

2591
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:24,150
production.

2592
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:27,810
So I think we should be
building more of these machines.

2593
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:32,210
And they are getting built
in the UK and in China.

2594
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:34,420
Not here.

2595
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:38,180
So if you were inspired
by anything you saw today,

2596
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:40,900
please write your
congressman or congressperson

2597
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:43,303
and say, why do we
have-- so point out,

2598
02:03:43,303 --> 02:03:44,970
it was actually up
on your slides, Nuno.

2599
02:03:44,970 --> 02:03:47,230
We have a cost sharing
program, which is basically

2600
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:49,150
like SpaceX infusion.

2601
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:52,210
And, against $7 billion,
the federal government

2602
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:54,700
has allocated $45 million.

2603
02:03:54,700 --> 02:04:03,400
So only government can say 0.4%
is cost matching into this.

2604
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,140
It's a bold, decadal
vision where we've

2605
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:07,120
wasted three years already.

2606
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:09,740
[INAUDIBLE] an
official [INAUDIBLE].

2607
02:04:09,740 --> 02:04:12,260
They stated that
this is a priority

2608
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,260
to have fusion on
the grid by 2035.

2609
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:17,870
So what we want to see is
the money match [INAUDIBLE].

2610
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:21,530
But it is an important
part of American leadership

2611
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:24,470
in this area where the
leading fusion companies are

2612
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:28,770
in the US, a lot thanks to
MIT, I would argue, in this,

2613
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:32,900
yet we are not getting the
commensurate support that's

2614
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,580
needed from the
public side in this

2615
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,470
because this is a big lift
about getting these going.

2616
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:39,900
So I'm not kidding.

2617
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:42,570
If you're inspired by this and
you think this is important,

2618
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:44,280
pick up the phone,
write a letter.

2619
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:47,180
It's like, this is an important
thing where we as a government

2620
02:04:47,180 --> 02:04:48,550
are lagging behind.

2621
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:54,930

2622
02:04:54,930 --> 02:05:00,490
[INAUDIBLE] and all of our
audience for your participation

2623
02:05:00,490 --> 02:05:02,110
in this program.

2624
02:05:02,110 --> 02:05:06,460
I do want to invite you to
our reception downstairs

2625
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:07,780
on the first floor.

2626
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:12,100
And I hope I can also
show you upcoming events.

2627
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:20,060
So on the 13th of November,
we have our next major event

2628
02:05:20,060 --> 02:05:24,030
at the Wong auditorium.

2629
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:29,420
So this is an opportunity
to attend our colloquium

2630
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:32,250
that we have each year at
the MIT Energy Initiative.

2631
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:34,400
So we hope you join us there.

2632
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:34,900
[INAUDIBLE]

2633
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:35,866
What?

2634
02:05:35,866 --> 02:05:37,315
[INAUDIBLE]

2635
02:05:37,315 --> 02:05:38,190
Yes, exactly.

2636
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:41,955

2637
02:05:41,955 --> 02:05:47,520
So do plan to join
us for that event.

2638
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,580
And I invite our
speakers and all of you

2639
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:54,550
to join us for the reception and
continue the conversation there.

2640
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,090
Thank you.

2641
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:58,440
[APPLAUSE]

2642
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:01,000
