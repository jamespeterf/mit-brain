1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,840
collaboration with MIT and other key

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,920
players in the field of innovation

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,960
allows us to drive new solutions that

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,160
the minister said and Ivana Regala

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,080
mentioned this also and all this shapes

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,039
the future of mining, the exter exchange

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,920
of knowledge, research and finally to

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,640
create a dynamic and changing ecosystem

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,120
capable to adapt two new times and very

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,239
collaborative and that's why we are all

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,200
here this morning and we are also

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:46,399
followed by streaming from AMSA

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,120
and uh and all and it's time to listen

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,239
to other experiences and with this we

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,239
would like to welcome Eduardo Gerido

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,920
the director

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,960
of uh the industrial leazison program of

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
the MIT

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good morning. It is a pleasure to be

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,080
third year.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,640
I thank Minister Williams for her words

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:31,439
for being present. Iana regard franco

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,000
the communication team for enabling this

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,600
wonderful event that I hope you will

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,560
enjoy. What you can see on the screen is

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:46,880
the Stata Center. This is the host of

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,920
the MIT AI center built by Frank Gary.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,200
As most of you know he's the architect

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,360
of Guggenheim in Bilbao.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,360
Now Let's start with this seminar.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,599
MIT

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,480
has five schools. The engineering school

34
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,640
is the

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,800
renowned the renowned one. But there are

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,280
also very important schools such as the

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
school of sciences, architecture and

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,239
planning that is the number two in the

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,239
country. The school of business slom

40
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,879
ranked

41
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,200
among the first five of the country. We

42
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,000
have a school of humanities, arts and

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,959
social sciences with a series of

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,519
departments. But I want to highlight the

45
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,640
department of economy generating Nobel

46
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,879
prizes. among them the most recent ones.

47
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,879
There is also a department of political

48
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:02,319
sciences. MIT also leads in political

49
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,440
sciences and recently we have the

50
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,800
Schwvartzman College of Computing

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,720
Recognizing the significance of AI and

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,720
it in everything we do today.

53
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,400
>> Let me give you some figures. MIT has

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,200
over 1,000 full-time professors

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:32,480
and over 5,000 almost 6,000 researchers.

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,959
28% of them is women.

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,599
Almost 6,000 researchers, some of them

58
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,000
are visitors. MIT

59
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:45,840
dedicates $880 million yearly to

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,680
research without considering

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,000
1.2 2 billion dollars de dedicated by

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,720
Lincoln lab also managed by MIT which

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,599
works exclusively with the federal

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:05,680
government another figure in 2023

65
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,280
MIT received uh several patents almost

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,239
20% focus or dedicated to research comes

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,840
from the industry MIT doesn't make any

68
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,720
sense without the industry we exist

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,160
Because of the industry, we've had

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,320
several Nobel prizes. 13 of them are

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,440
teaching

72
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
and we have almost 12,000 students.

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:35,600
Twothirds are in post-graduate and one/3

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,759
in pre uh graduate levels. The school of

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,440
engineering has an enrollment ratio of

76
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
4.3%.

77
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,120
Four out of 100 applicants were

78
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,520
accepted. it is very difficult to be

79
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,800
enrolled to be allowed in.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,440
So uh in the undergradu we have a high

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,759
percentage of women and 42% in

82
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,840
postgraduate.

83
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,120
MIT has several initiatives of research

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,520
covering the entire institute but I

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
would like to stress on the these three

86
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,160
ones. The first one climate and

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,960
sustainability.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,479
There is a climate project at MIT. The

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,960
second one is life sciences MIT heels.

90
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,880
And the third one is computing and AI.

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,320
This is the MIT generative AI impact

92
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,080
consortium recent initiatives

93
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,160
across the institute. Particularly the

94
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,280
climate project is the most important or

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
significant project launched by Sally

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Conrod.

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,440
MIT over a decade

98
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,840
should become the university that is

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,800
more prolific in terms of solutions

100
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,080
related to climate change not only

101
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,400
technologically speaking but also in

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,800
terms of performance and policies.

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,160
There are six missions.

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,199
The first one is decarbonization

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,960
of energy in the industry. We believe

106
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:23,600
this is key having new alternative

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,479
sources of emissions and clean energies.

108
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,039
Recently in May, one month ago, an

109
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,560
initiative was launched which is the

110
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,600
initiative for new manufacturing.

111
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,840
This is also an institutewide effort

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,120
aiming at creating innovative

113
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,919
jobs related to manufacturing

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,520
because we do believe that today it is

115
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,639
very important for the industries to be

116
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,280
based on the USA as well as in other

117
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,960
countries.

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,360
We feel very proud

119
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,240
of the collaboration with Antoagasta

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,160
Minerals. They are an innovative

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,479
company. MIT doesn't make any sense

122
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,440
without the industry. As I said, the

123
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,840
interaction creates knowledge, mutual

124
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,720
learning. This is not about coming here

125
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,160
to teach. We come here to learn as well.

126
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,639
This is a birectional path. With

127
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,599
antagusta minerals, we have developed

128
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,080
many things and we have learned a lot. I

129
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,240
will not go into details. Uh but the

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,440
goals are zero waste, decarbonization,

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,160
automated and remotely operated systems,

132
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,520
the community engagement is also key.

133
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Mining for us is critical. Everybody

134
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,599
says that if we want to move towards

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:54,080
effective decarbonization to migrate to

136
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:58,080
electric trucks, we need copper.

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,440
So, we are aligned and I am happy to be

138
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,080
here today. You will hear from two

139
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,440
professors, Jose Pateco, the use of

140
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,400
sensors and digital twins to control and

141
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,080
improve processes and Ben Armstrong who

142
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,879
will talk about the work of the future.

143
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,680
I think this is very interesting because

144
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,479
it combines two important aspects for

145
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,800
MIT technology and humans. Thank you

146
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,800
very much.
