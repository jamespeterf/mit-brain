1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,960
And our next speaker is Brock Yordi from

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,960
the Geothermal Drilling Association. And

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,760
he had the pleasure of collaborating

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,080
with Brock this past summer to do um

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
geothermal driller pre-apprentice uh

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
program.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
>> Should not have taken that.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
>> So how does this work? Do I still have

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,800
20 minutes or uh

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,800
Sorry, Brock.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
>> They wanted you to put it on the next

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
guy.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
>> Excellent.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,280
>> So, we're going to do introduction to

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,320
geothermal drilling a bridged in 20

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
minutes. Um, there's plenty of things in

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,360
here and we have heard about how

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,160
drilling affects us. And I think any of

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
you that are flipping the television and

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,960
you come across FX and you see the movie

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,520
Armageddon, you can see that the major

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
premise is it's easier to teach drillers

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
to be astronauts than it is to teach an

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,439
astronaut to be a driller. When Ben

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,520
Affleck asked that question, uh, some

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
choice words were used by m Michael Bay,

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,920
but in reality, suspension of disbelief

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,920
is what we're looking at.

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
jump past that. Okay, here's my warning.

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
The following presentation features

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,479
tribal drilling knowledge acquired by

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,400
drilling professionals or under the

33
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,880
supervision of geothermal professionals.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
Accordingly, me must insist that

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,560
everyone who engages with drilling in

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,360
this presentation consider this advice.

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,000
Drilling is the imperfect combination of

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
science, physics, and self-taught tribal

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,880
knowledge compounded over years of

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,640
success and failure. Drilling is a

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,320
disruptive process. We know this. The

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,479
key to the success lies in your

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,479
conscious choice of the drilling program

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,479
that minimizes the impact of the

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,799
surrounding environment. That's the bore

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,360
hole. That's the neighbors. That's the

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,520
project staying on time.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
Drillers, contractors, engineers,

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,239
scientists, and clients have entered in

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,640
a powerful partnership to uncover the

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,560
mysteries of the subsurface. We are

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,280
discovering the unknown together.

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,480
And how are we going to do that? A

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,480
bridge version 20 minutes, right?

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
It's simple. We have a drilling system.

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,080
And we've seen this from uh the OG

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,160
Garren Eubanks to as we've talked a lot

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,560
geology

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,800
formation hydraulics depth to water

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
subsurface challenges. Those are the

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,000
things that I'm thinking about when we

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,239
say can we drill this next. That's going

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
to align into my drilling capabilities.

64
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,120
This is my drilling system. So, what can

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,319
my rig capable of doing? From horsepower

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,360
to rotation to pull down to pullback to

67
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,280
diameter, depth, angle. This is all

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,519
going to drive our cost. Next, choice of

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,080
drilling method. Back to that drilling

70
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,400
program. Is it going to be using mud

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
pumps, air compressors, sonic, dual

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,280
rotary, reverse circulation? There are

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
plenty. Hopefully, one day we get a rock

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,519
melter, right? Maybe a laser. We keep

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
seeing things come out all the time.

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,400
Finally, as much as we want to say

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,159
autonomy is coming and it's really cool

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,920
watching the Dragon Rocket go up and uh

79
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,799
there's nobody really at the control,

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,959
but they still uh individual can be at

81
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,760
that stick at any moment. And this

82
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,840
processing right here will always be

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
very important to what we're doing. So

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
our driller, our drilling company, our

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
contractor's qualifications, what

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
special tools do they bring, what

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
methods, what applied science and

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,360
fundamentals.

89
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,000
So as I think of that, the driller and

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,920
we talk about workforce development, we

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
talk about developing this, the liftoff

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,879
report talks about where we need to be,

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
what we need for workforce. He and Ia

94
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,720
and I with Stacy right here in the front

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,560
row with the the time and uh we we have

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,080
collaborated a ton on workforce

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,280
development and developing these

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,680
drillers. But the critical system that I

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,479
just showed you doesn't work without a

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,320
competent drill crew that's working in

101
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,120
safety first because we're rotating,

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,240
we're per cussing, we're lifting things

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,919
over our heads. So, as that drill crew

104
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,720
steps up into this critical system,

105
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,680
what's their goal for the day, what is

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,720
the quality of the installation, what is

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,880
the site and environmental impacts and

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
management, what is the goal for project

109
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,800
completion, staying on time, staying

110
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,840
under budget. Did I say under budget?

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,040
And I'm a drill guy. Whoa. preparation

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,400
and planning for unseen issues,

113
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,680
for foreseen issues, weather, you know,

114
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,080
those challenging geologies,

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,520
roles and responsibilities of that crew,

116
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,720
the driller, rig operation. This is a

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,720
complex process that has microscond

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,360
adjustments that need to be made at

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
times. They need to understand this so

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
they can have effective product

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,840
installation and we get effective

122
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
resource extraction so we have good

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,960
project completion and good

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
recordkeeping. We have an assistant

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,160
driller there supporting that driller

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
rig support tool handling product

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
assembly getting into the standards that

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
we just talked about from pressure

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,280
testing to making sure our grout making

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,919
sure we're making that right hole. And

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
then finally, our field technician who

132
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,320
is doing the solids control management

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,840
because let's face it, we love this

134
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,720
concept of drilling and putting bore

135
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,120
holes in. We forget about the cubic

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,240
yards of material we pull out of the

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,360
ground and how we're going to do that

138
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,360
five times to 90 times to 600 to a

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
thousand times.

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
And we have to be able to manage that.

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
So three people we can get away with

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,240
two. It depends on the project, the

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,479
timeline and the expectations.

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, we're all going to become drillers

145
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,479
today.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,479
This is the basic fundamentals. I am

147
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,039
exerting force against our geology. And

148
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,199
then I have to cut it. So is that in

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,759
rotation? Is that in percussion? Is that

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,880
in velocity? Is that in frequency? As we

151
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,199
see with sonic drilling. Next, I have to

152
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,440
remove those solids or it's not a bore

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,759
hole, right? It's just a uh thing that

154
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,800
we got stuck in. And man, we don't drill

155
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,520
more bore holes. So, I have to flush it.

156
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
I can do this either mechanically,

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,240
that's with augers, that's with uh

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,919
frequency, or flushing with water, air,

159
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,080
drilling fluids, engineered solutions.

160
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,720
This is straight air rotary. We can see

161
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,080
one's going into some rock here, and we

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,199
have one going into a blue green shale.

163
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,160
Nice, clean, out of the way. No water

164
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,560
table here. How many times are we

165
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,199
intersecting water tables and producing

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,039
water? This is a big piece for us in our

167
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,880
cost, in our responsibility as a

168
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,960
driller. Here's mud rotary conventional.

169
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
Man, it looks messy. So, we immediately

170
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,639
go, we want to go back to that other

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,599
slide, but we can't. We have to select

172
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,680
the right method for the right geology.

173
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,720
So, we get into engineered drilling

174
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,240
solutions. Uh Jordan, I drilled with the

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,000
US military to 2400 feet with bubbles.

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,960
Got the nickname Captain Bubbles for

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,880
that entire project. We can use foam

178
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,800
with low hydraulic hydraulic

179
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,520
conductivity and carry those cutings

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,560
out. Mud, mud rotary, why it's been

181
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,960
predominant throughout geothermal is

182
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,360
because again it's low influence to our

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,199
ground, but it creates two waist streams

184
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,039
and we've decided those waist streams

185
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,280
are much harder to get rid of.

186
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,599
So, let's look at this. We're going to

187
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,319
talk conventional rotary. We could get

188
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,960
into dual rotary. And I'll say competent

189
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
drilling companies, they're good. And

190
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,879
they have invested in lots of different

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,680
pieces of equipment. And here's the

192
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,160
deal. They're going to sell you on their

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,360
system. And sometimes those systems are

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,039
bougie bore holes that go 850 ft at an

195
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
angle. And we need that because of the

196
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,520
footprint in the solution. And there's

197
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,120
other times where we can simplify this.

198
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,319
And if you look at the liftoff report

199
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,879
with 80 million B buildings, we need

200
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,599
that holistic approach of everybody

201
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,399
drilling. This is Armageddon, right? We

202
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,399
saw 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. That

203
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
meteor is coming here. We all get to be

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,719
Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis in this

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,279
situation. So as we look at this, we

206
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,120
have mud drilling. I need to be able to

207
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,680
remove solids from the bottom of the

208
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,000
bore hole at the bit face at somewhere

209
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,959
between 60 and 150 feet per minute. Low

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,680
conductivity. I'm not going to force on

211
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,680
those fragile formations. I get into

212
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,760
air. I think about Stan Lee and

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,480
Spider-Man. With great power comes great

214
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,880
responsibility. Holy cow, I can move

215
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
cutings out of the hole at 7500 feet per

216
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
minute.

217
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,720
job should be done under budget, on

218
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,040
time, like super fast. We'll have cars

219
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
going back over that road, right? But

220
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,519
that's competent rock formations. That's

221
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,519
no water. What happens when we start

222
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,320
those waist streams? So then we start

223
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,519
engineering solutions either in mud or

224
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,160
in foam and we can start changing what

225
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
we need. the influence to that borehole

226
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,200
wall. As we talk about that thermal

227
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,399
conductivity test, as we talk about

228
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,959
all of those pieces of influencing and

229
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,000
minimizing that impact come from us

230
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,560
matching the right drilling method to

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,120
what we're going to be in.

232
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,600
So what do I need out of that drilling

233
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,080
program? I need an efficient rate of

234
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
penetration because let's face it, uh,

235
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,800
with the drilling companies that are in

236
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,560
here, time and diesel fuel, regardless

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,120
of our waist stream, because guess what

238
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,040
clients, you're a co-generator, that's

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
your waist stream. We're just managing

240
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,959
it for us. Time and diesel fuel are the

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,839
most expensive pieces for our projects.

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,480
So, I need to be able to have good rate

243
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,959
of penetration and good production.

244
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,560
Next, while doing that, I have to

245
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,720
minimize the impact to the bore hole and

246
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
think about how I'm influencing that

247
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
downhole geology. I talked about geology

248
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
next to it. I said, "Formation

249
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,800
hydraulics." I want you to think about

250
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,279
um I was in wood shop. There's this

251
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
really cute uh individual next to me.

252
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,000
It's Mother's Day. We're building

253
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,480
birdhouses. I want to ask her to prom.

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
So, I grab my birdhouse with the pine

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
and I drive all the screws in it and I

256
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,640
get it done. It fell apart two months

257
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,680
later in mom's yard. Amanda's birdhouse,

258
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,920
I helped her pre-drill all the holes. We

259
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,320
set it. We put the wood glue. Our

260
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,320
geology is the same way. When we break

261
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,160
that fracture gradient, just the same as

262
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,720
if I drive a screw into this right now

263
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,519
and split this table. I can putty that.

264
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,680
I can do things to it, but I can't fix

265
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,800
the damage I've done to mother nature.

266
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,959
So beyond that, we get through those

267
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,920
fragile subsurface formations, we get

268
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,000
into water production.

269
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,800
I want you to watch the news right now.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,320
Thank you. Um

271
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,480
Princeton and Arizona came out with a

272
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
connection between surface water and

273
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
groundwater talking about fossilized

274
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,200
water. Holy cow, it's the drill guy

275
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,959
talking environmentalism now. It's weird

276
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
time. Drill, baby, drill. No drill,

277
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,000
better drill. We need better people

278
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,320
drilling professionally. So we are

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,200
pumping fossilized water out of

280
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,320
aquifers. That's going to take 10 years

281
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,440
to 10,000 to 100,000 years to replace.

282
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,040
So we saved the planet by 2100, but we

283
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
exploited all our groundwater and went

284
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,800
into the Atlantic. Did we save

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880
ourselves?

286
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,800
So we have to understand as we produce

287
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,880
that water and how much and the

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,279
influence. But beyond that, as we go

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,560
deeper, we have to start thinking about

290
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,839
volatile gases, CO2, hydrogen sulfide,

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:22,399
methane. And on that minimal impact, as

292
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:25,519
we step back, dust, noise, drill solids,

293
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,160
as we look at more campuses being done,

294
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
man, Ball State, they didn't care how

295
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
many dump trucks came through. Those

296
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,839
were all Indiana farm kids.

297
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,360
You go to Yale, you go to um Forom and

298
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
you start thinking about how we're

299
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,360
removing cutings and people are like,

300
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,839
"Why are there 10 dump trucks a day

301
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,920
coming through here?" We we have to

302
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,800
think about the impact to our neighbors.

303
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,519
Finally, I need data gathering. I need

304
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,800
real-time analysis of that subsurface as

305
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,120
those formations change as uh we have

306
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,120
challenges as we have loss zones because

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I have to effectively be able to grout

308
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,839
that so that I have the right influence

309
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
to the loops.

310
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,480
So the results of me doing this right

311
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,079
the hole is going to be open meaning I

312
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
can get product into it. It's going to

313
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,680
be gauge again my drilling influencing

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,079
my geology. If we specify a six-inch

315
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,839
bore hole and we look at the cubic feet

316
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,000
or the cubic yards of grout we want to

317
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,079
put in there and we end up with this

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,920
oblong boiler hole, we just saw what

319
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,480
Garren talked about. We heard what Mark

320
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,920
was talking about. We've screwed up and

321
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,800
now we have an ineffective system. So I

322
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,800
need gauge. I need stable so that I can

323
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,240
get in and out of it. It needs to be

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,079
straight in the desired direction.

325
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,399
And we need seamless product

326
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,880
installation. Loop to bottom, drought to

327
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,880
top. So I can have efficient resource

328
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,880
extraction.

329
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Sounds easy. But then we get into this

330
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,800
situation right here. All different

331
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,440
types of drill solids. How mother nature

332
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,920
reacts to us. How our subsurface works.

333
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,440
These spoils as I get them out of the

334
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,639
hole. How do I handle them?

335
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,560
6inch bore hole to 400T. It's 2.9 cubic

336
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
yards. Oh, by the way, that's why we

337
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,320
have three people on a drill crew

338
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,079
because there is a lot. If we're going

339
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,040
to increase production, you need to be

340
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:24,720
able to move this stuff away. 6 inch

341
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,560
850T hole is 6.17 cubic yards. So, as we

342
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,480
start thinking about this, how many dump

343
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,880
trucks and back trucks am I bringing

344
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,320
into this project?

345
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,519
Loop installation. as we specify two

346
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,079
loops, you know, um the BEu building

347
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,959
with the Ryan 1500 ft. We think about

348
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,040
all these different pieces. I need a

349
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,000
good effective drilling program so I can

350
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,920
have good grouting process.

351
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,320
This loop should be in the center and

352
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,760
that trim should be on top of it. But

353
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm really bad at paint. And uh this is

354
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,120
what we get. So here's our trim to

355
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,480
bottom, our loop to bottom. My

356
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,880
individual starts mixing the grout to

357
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
the specified specifications that we

358
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,839
need. The right amount of water, the

359
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,959
right amount of bentonite, the right

360
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,199
amount of graphite or sand.

361
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,519
I start filling that bore hole. As I

362
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,079
fill that bore hole, that trim needs to

363
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,399
stay 10 feet submerged in the grout. So,

364
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,079
I have continuous grout column coming

365
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,000
out. We talk about now we're going to

366
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,760
leave the trim in at bottom. No, we're

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,199
not going to do this. I started my

368
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,839
career after Yordian Sons at

369
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,519
Hallebertton. I studied grouts for 10

370
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,440
years.

371
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,760
I'm bringing this grout column out of

372
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,519
the hole with my Trimmy and that's what

373
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,680
I want to see. I want to see grout to

374
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,600
surface. I need to effectively be able

375
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,519
to look at that grout and know that I

376
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,279
had a good

377
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,199
column come out that I didn't have

378
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,880
channeling in that as we have these

379
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,360
discussions about ah it just needs to be

380
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,680
four feet in the ground. No, I need to

381
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,120
see this because this is protecting us.

382
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,440
I need to see it come to surface.

383
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,839
Why? because I am replacing the native

384
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,519
material that I just destroyed with

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,199
something that meets or exceeds Thank

386
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,560
you. our ceiling capability. It's got to

387
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,399
have a better standard. I need to ensure

388
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,079
continuous contact between the loops and

389
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
bore holes. We got some brilliant

390
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,480
individuals in here. You ask them what

391
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,360
happens if we have a bad grout column in

392
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,440
that air pocket. I need to completely

393
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,839
seal the annular space to prevent

394
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,160
co-mingling of aquifers and prevent

395
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
surface contamination. As we look at

396
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,839
these projects and we go, "Hey, there's

397
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,720
this open area. Let's put a bore field

398
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,360
here. Is it lowland? Is it does it

399
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,600
flood?" My favorite question to ask when

400
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,160
I show up on these projects is why isn't

401
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,320
there a Starbucks here?

402
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,839
If not, my greatest generation, my

403
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,120
grandfather, they were really good at

404
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,880
burying things. And we're gonna find it.

405
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,800
So I need to prevent that surface

406
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
contamination. I need to comply with

407
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
federal state laws and I need that

408
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,000
thermal conductivity and borehole

409
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,480
integrity to stay. This is my method

410
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
when we check out my hour presentation

411
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,319
not abridged. So we can get into this.

412
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,199
This is what I want to talk about.

413
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,039
Success to a drilling project is managed

414
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,720
through these points and whether we're

415
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,640
doing this all because of the climate

416
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,799
change. Right? We have to understand how

417
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
this is changing our drill and build

418
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,919
schedule. Next, other construction

419
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,319
operations. What are our regulations?

420
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,480
Location, location, location, project

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,280
timeline, and then neighbors. How am I

422
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,840
sharing that site? How am I protecting

423
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,000
mother nature? This is the reality of

424
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,120
projects from downtown Los Angeles for

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
George Lucas to right here just outside

426
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,559
of Boston to a very tight location,

427
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,480
urban, a church.

428
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
This is what kicks our butt, everybody.

429
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,160
And this is if there was a slide to take

430
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,080
a picture of, this is the one because

431
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
every time I get on a new call to

432
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,919
troubleshoot a problematic project, I

433
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,640
add to this slide. So if green local

434
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,400
geology should not be an issue, we

435
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,720
should have an effective amount of test

436
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,880
bore holes to know. So if I'm drilling a

437
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,600
600 hole project and I do two bore

438
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,120
holes, is that a rep representative

439
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,760
sample? No. That doesn't get us what we

440
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,320
need. We need that subsurface data.

441
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,720
What's hard? Man-made subsurface

442
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,679
obstructions and contaminants,

443
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,640
problematic subsurfaces as we get into

444
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,440
fragile formations or water or artisian

445
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,120
flow and utilities. And those are the

446
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,320
things that we have to be planning with

447
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,160
the right qualified contractor. So if I

448
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
have that right qualified contractor and

449
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,880
we have our pilot team right there, the

450
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,880
pilot tutorial, thank you. uh watching

451
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,520
skillings drill and that was a wonderful

452
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,280
experience with all of them. What am I

453
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
doing to choose this project? If you

454
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,480
call me as a contractor, equipment

455
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,960
availability, tooling, drilling method,

456
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,360
compatibility with the location, site

457
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,760
footprint, environmental demand, what is

458
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,480
my timeline, what is the borefield

459
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,200
design and borehole design, project

460
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,919
restoration and cleanup. That's a big

461
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,320
piece is managing our projects so that

462
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,400
CSM or Clark or whoever you're using for

463
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,679
your GC isn't like you're going to drill

464
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,320
another bore hole and we're going to

465
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,080
walk around in 18 inches of slop. You

466
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,520
know what are my licenses? Am I

467
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,120
accredited? These are all pieces.

468
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
This is what we can do at test bore

469
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,840
holes when we're surgical.

470
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,600
You can see this project. We had snow

471
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,840
and rain. It was Chicago. It was the end

472
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,679
of October. This is how we left the job

473
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,360
site. So, lessons learned.

474
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,520
Every contractor is going to have an

475
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,840
argument on why their method's the best.

476
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,240
It's your choice how you move along with

477
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,000
that. You know, we need to optimize

478
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,240
drilling every chance we can get.

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What do I want? I want qualified

480
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,039
contractors. I want the right drilling

481
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,440
method for the area. I want test bore

482
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,440
holes. I want test wells that give us

483
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,760
the right data. I want us to think about

484
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,840
what we did successfully before and how

485
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,200
we loop and grout that. That was 21ish

486
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,200
minutes. Thank you, Stacy. Thank you,

487
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
everybody.
