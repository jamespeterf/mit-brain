1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,199
often times in applying the

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,320
probabilistic method we'll need to

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,000
understand whether a certain random

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,680
structure typically have a property that

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,320
we're looking for in this video we'll

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,199
look at one such property and understand

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,480
how to analyze whether a certain random

8
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,920
graph have the property of containing a

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,920
triangle with high

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,960
probability the object we're going to be

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,120
looking at today is the a r random

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,800
graph commonly referred to as

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,360
GNP and this is the graph consists of

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,320
placing n

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,680
vertices and for each pair of vertices

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,480
we put down an edge between them with

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,440
probability P independently for all

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,640
pairs of vertices

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,960
in other words we flip a biased coin

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,439
that comes up heads with probability P

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,400
independently for each possible Edge and

22
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,960
put down the edge randomly as such this

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,759
is a random graph it's a random

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,159
structure it's a random object and we

25
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,840
would like to understand various

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,200
properties of this random graph and the

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,119
property that we're going to look at in

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,920
this video is the following does this

29
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,079
random graph typically contain a

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,159
triangle

31
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,560
in the rest of this video we'll be

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,520
looking at p as a function of n so p is

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,280
allowed to change depending on

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,479
N we denote this dependence by a

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,920
subscript but out of convenience will

36
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,880
drop the subscript for the rest of the

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,520
video okay so GMP does a typically

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,600
contain a triangle well by typically I

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,520
mean the following mathematically

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,640
precise meaning

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,000
typically means with probability that

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,440
approaches one as n goes to

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,599
Infinity so the statements we're going

44
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,239
to be looking at are ASM totic as n

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,680
becomes

46
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,800
large the main theorem that will prove

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
in this video is the following well

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,319
there are two

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,040
statements I've conveniently labeled

50
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:28,120
them Z zero and theem

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,720
one theorem zero sometimes referred to

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,599
as the zero statement is the statement

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,480
about not having any triangles having

54
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,160
zero

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,280
triangles and it says that if n * P

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,040
remember p is a function of n p is

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,360
allowed to depend on N if n * P

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,680
approaches zero as n goes to Infinity

59
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,599
then this random graph GMP is triangle

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,040
free with probability approaching one as

61
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,959
n goes to

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,480
Infinity in other words with high

63
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,440
probability this random graph does not

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,640
have any

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,440
triangles this makes sense in that this

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,799
graph is pretty sparse when p is small

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,239
right so this statement basically says

68
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,480
that P is much less than 1 / n in terms

69
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,360
of the growth rate so when p is very

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,159
small you expect not so many edges and

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,879
it turns out that there's not going to

72
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,720
be a triangle typically in this random

73
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:32,319
graph the second part is z and one the

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,640
one statement and it's says that when NP

75
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,239
approaches

76
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,720
Infinity again p is a function of n then

77
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,959
this random graph GMP typically contains

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,000
a triangle I.E it contains a triangle

79
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,720
with probability that approaches one as

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,720
n goes to

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,200
Infinity so if you have a high Edge

82
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,040
probability then typically you expect to

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,319
see triangle in a random instantiation

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,519
of this random graph

85
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,599
GNP one way to summarize both statements

86
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,920
is the following one/ N is a threshold

87
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,680
for the property of containing a

88
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,400
triangle to interpret the sentence

89
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,160
imagine if p is much larger than 1 / n

90
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,800
then we're in the theorem one setting

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,840
then the random graph typically contains

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,919
a triangle whereas if p is much smaller

93
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,280
than 1 / n in the sense of being in the

94
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:36,520
Zer zum zero setting then typically the

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,440
random graph does not contain any

96
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,919
triangles so 1/ N is a threshold

97
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,919
depending on whether the edge

98
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,440
probability p is much larger or much

99
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,639
smaller than 1 / n we expect very

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,840
different behaviors from the perspective

101
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,240
of whether the graph contains a

102
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,080
triangle this type of statements

103
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,080
are widely studied in combinatorics in

104
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,080
probability and understanding how to

105
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,759
establish and prove these type of

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,759
statements are some of the bread and

107
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
butter of probabilistic

108
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,400
combinatorics so in this video let us

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,560
prove the statement in this

110
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,240
box let's start with the easier

111
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:22,400
Direction which in this case is the

112
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,400
first statement uh theorem zero so let's

113
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,160
prove theorem zero

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,880
we're looking at triangles so let's

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,280
define a random variable X to be the

116
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,280
number of

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,199
triangles

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,840
in the random graph

119
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,160
G&P we can compute the expectation of X

120
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,199
with not much difficulty because by

121
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,120
linearity of expectations there are n

122
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,520
choose three triples of vertices and

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,639
each triple forms a triangle with

124
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,639
probability P

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
cubed we see that this quantity here is

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,080
on the

127
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:18,840
order of n cubed P

128
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:25,240
cubed we get to drop constant factors in

129
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:28,720
this ASM totic estimate now when NP goes

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,400
to zero as n goes to Infinity n Cub P

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
cubed also go goes to zero so this

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,280
quantity is little o of one it's a

133
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,280
quantity that goes to zero as n goes to

134
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,560
Infinity let us now apply maros

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,360
inequality

136
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,160
we explained and proved markov's

137
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,720
inequality in a different video by

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
markov's

139
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,360
inequality we find that the probability

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,440
that X is at least one

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,120
is at most the expectation of

142
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,039
x divid

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,520
one and from earlier this quantity is L

144
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,879
to O of one all right so the number of

145
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,000
triangles is typically small in

146
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,520
expectation so it's small in expectation

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,280
and therefore the probability that

148
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,360
there's at least one triangle goes to

149
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,080
zero as n goes to

150
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,599
Infinity right thus

151
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,400
the previous statement is

152
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,440
equivalent to the statement

153
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:45,520
that the probability that there are zero

154
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,840
triangles approaches one as n goes to

155
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,159
Infinity

156
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,199
okay but this finishes the first part of

157
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,960
the

158
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,599
theorem in the first part The Edge

159
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,560
probability is very small and so the

160
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,800
expected number of triangles

161
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,960
is goes to zero as n goes to infinity

162
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,560
and by Mark of inequality we see that

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,000
typically there should not be any

164
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,960
triangles in this random

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,560
graph let us now move on to the second

166
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,560
part in the second

167
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,639
part namely theorem

168
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,560
one if

169
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:32,640
we use the setup that we had earlier we

170
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,440
see that the number of triangles in

171
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,519
expectation goes to Infinity as n goes

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,839
to

173
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:46,200
Infinity however this does not

174
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:48,800
immediately imply that X is typically

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,680
positive because it could be the case

176
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,760
that X is still typically zero but is

177
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,760
very very large a

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,800
diminishing fraction of the time

179
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,120
and in that case we will still be able

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,279
to have the statement that the

181
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,360
expectation of X goes to Infinity well

182
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,360
it would not be true that X is typically

183
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,600
positive so we'll need additional ideas

184
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,000
to establish that X is typically

185
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,600
positive and what we will do is to use

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
the second moment

187
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,360
bound to show that X is

188
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,399
typically close to its

189
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,040
mean so the x is very concentrated

190
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,920
around its

191
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:55,279
expectation and in that case having

192
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,680
expectation that goes to Infinity we

193
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,640
then imply that X is typically positive

194
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,920
so let's carry out this

195
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,200
idea let's consider the

196
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,760
following

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,760
probability we see

198
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,839
that

199
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:25,279
the probability that

200
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:28,120
X is equal to zero okay well if x is

201
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,079
equal to zero and here x is some non-

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,560
negative quantity

203
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,600
then this statement is equivalent to the

204
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,880
statement

205
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,880
that

206
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:48,399
X deviates

207
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,399
from its mean in the downward Direction

208
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,880
by minus the expectation of X okay so

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,040
this is the same as X less than equal to

210
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,839
zero but X is always non- negative so

211
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,200
these two probabilities are equal to

212
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,760
each other

213
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,519
we can

214
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,519
then relax the event

215
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,480
inside as

216
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,680
such again noting that the expectation

217
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,800
of X is always non-

218
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,120
negative okay now we apply chapy shifts

219
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,360
inequality

220
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,720
okay so in this step we can apply chabby

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,440
shfs inequality and you'll find an

222
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,399
explanation and proof of chabby shfs

223
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,519
inequality in a different

224
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,440
video which allows us to conclude that

225
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:52,920
this probability is at most the variance

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,920
of x divided by the expectation of X

227
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,240
squar all right so what have we learned

228
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,279
from this

229
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,800
calculation let me State a

230
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:11,480
corollary

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:17,000
if the expectation of

232
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,000
X is much smaller so if the variance of

233
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:30,399
X is much smaller than the square of

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,480
expectation then the right hand side

235
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,120
goes to

236
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,120
zero as then goes to Infinity which then

237
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:45,240
implies X is

238
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,000
positive with high probability meaning

239
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,279
that this probability that X is positive

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,279
goes to one as n goes to

241
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,680
Infinity okay so this is the conclusion

242
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,120
that we will use to establish theorem

243
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,120
one

244
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,800
X still the number of triangles will be

245
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:14,839
able to write in the following way X is

246
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,839
equal to the sum over all triples of

247
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:27,320
vertices the following quantity x i j x

248
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,320
i k XJ K where we Define this x sub I as

249
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:36,880
follows x sub i j is equal to 1 if J is

250
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,880
an

251
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,240
edge and zero if i j is not an

252
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,120
edge the vertices are labeled

253
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,560
by numbers one through

254
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,360
n okay so you see this sum which is

255
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,959
indexed over triples of

256
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:21,959
vertices each term is one

257
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:25,160
if these vertices i j and k is a

258
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:28,160
triangle and is zero otherwise so this

259
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,720
is the number of triangles in the graph

260
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,880
and let me

261
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,880
just because it will make the notation a

262
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,440
little

263
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,759
easier rewrite this quantity as such

264
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,880
here T ranges

265
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,839
over all

266
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,279
triples of vertices so onward the

267
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,560
triples of

268
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:55,839
vertices and X subt is this term so we

269
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:01,040
can rewrite this term as just a

270
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,040
single a single variable x sub IG

271
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,079
JK to apply the corollary we will need

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,920
to get some estimate on the variance of

273
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:16,160
X and we'll do so through co-variance so

274
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,160
as a reminder the

275
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:29,360
co-variance of two random

276
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:35,839
variables say Y and Z is defined to be

277
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:38,800
the expectation of y * Z minus the

278
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,800
expectation of

279
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,079
Y times the expectation of

280
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,600
Z in particular if y and z are

281
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,399
independent random variables then their

282
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,319
co-variance

283
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:57,040
zero and the

284
00:15:53,319 --> 00:16:00,920
variance of a random variable X is equal

285
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,920
to the co-variance of X with

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,560
itself okay so let us

287
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,800
compute the variance of x x being the

288
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,639
number of

289
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:19,199
triangles we can rewrite it as a

290
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,199
covariance of X with

291
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,800
itself here x we can write it as a sum

292
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,800
of various terms indexed by triples of

293
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
vertices

294
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,880
okay I'll use T for the first index in

295
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,839
the first sum and T Prime for the

296
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,160
indices in the second

297
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:52,120
sum the nice thing about covariance is

298
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,440
that it is a bilinear function if you

299
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,120
split Y in this covariance of Y and Z if

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,160
you split Y into a linear combination

301
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,160
various sums then you see that the

302
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,520
dependence in this formula is linear on

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,439
splitting y so you'll be able to write

304
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,720
the

305
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,439
covariance correspondingly as a

306
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,760
sum so given this covariance of these

307
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,600
two sums we can

308
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,600
distribute this

309
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
quantity

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,480
and write it as the covariance Over All

311
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:36,799
pairs of triples T and T

312
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:41,160
Prime the coari of x sub

313
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,160
T against X subt

314
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,280
Prime

315
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,039
okay now we need to understand this term

316
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:53,160
the co variance of X subt against the co

317
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,840
variance of X subt Prime to towards this

318
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,440
end let

319
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,120
us think about what happens to this ter

320
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,280
right so let me do a side

321
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:09,159
calculation from the definition of

322
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:13,640
covariance we see that this quantity

323
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:18,240
equals to the expectation of x subt x

324
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:22,000
subt Prime minus the expectation

325
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,880
of x subt times the expectation of X

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
subt

327
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,840
Prime okay there are a few cases that we

328
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,840
need to

329
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:41,159
consider

330
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:43,520
first x t and t Prime are two triples of

331
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,400
vertices and they could be in various

332
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,720
positions the coresponding full

333
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,880
triangles could be disjointed or they

334
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,760
could overlap and we need to consider

335
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,280
all of those

336
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,919
possibilities now before doing those

337
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,720
cases let's observe that this quantity

338
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:06,600
here if you have for

339
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,600
example T and T Prime

340
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,640
being in any number of configurations so

341
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,240
these are the vertices of T and this is

342
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,679
the vertices of T Prime for instance

343
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,000
right so they could share some edges or

344
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,000
they may overlapping some

345
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,440
edges but no matter what the

346
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,440
configurations are

347
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:37,240
the first term always equals to P raised

348
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:42,480
to the number of edges

349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:45,840
contained in the union of T and T

350
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,520
Prime so in in the complete graph right

351
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,679
so what I mean here

352
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,679
is the

353
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:03,200
following so here's P raised to the

354
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,520
number of yeah so P raised to let me

355
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,640
still write it this way and and then

356
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,400
we'll see some specific

357
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,799
examples and minus P raised to the

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,000
number of edges in T and P raised to the

359
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,159
number of edges in t Prime so here uh

360
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,120
the exponents will correspond to the

361
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,320
number of edges in the complete graph

362
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:26,120
Spann by these vertices T and T Prime so

363
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,640
let's look at a few different

364
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,640
possibilities the first is if

365
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:37,520
the two triangles T and T Prime do not

366
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,919
intersect in any edges so the number of

367
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,880
vertices they intersect is at most one

368
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,799
so the two scenarios are the one that I

369
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,520
just drew and if these two triangles

370
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,640
are even disjointed in their vertex set

371
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,600
so then there's no Edge

372
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,400
overlap in which case the edges right so

373
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
the V random variables that correspond

374
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,960
the edges of these two triangles because

375
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,480
they are independent of each other so

376
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,840
the covariance should be zero and indeed

377
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,039
in the first term here you have P raised

378
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,480
to the^ 6 and then minus P cubed and P

379
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,000
cubed and so in this case this Co

380
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,640
variance is

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,640
zero in the second

382
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:29,960
case when these two triples T and T

383
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Prime overlapping exactly two vertices

384
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,120
well here there

385
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,520
are um the union of these two triangles

386
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,720
so I think I misspoke earlier so by this

387
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,760
notation I really mean viewing t as a

388
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,039
triangle and T Prime as a triangle and

389
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,039
looking at the union of these two

390
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,960
triangles so the union of these two

391
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,880
triangles have five edges so that's the

392
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
number

393
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,039
of terms here dismissing repetition in

394
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,919
the first first first term the number of

395
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,520
fact the number of

396
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,640
factors and then

397
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:14,159
minus the later two terms

398
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,159
are both P cub and P cubed

399
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
okay

400
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,760
finally if T and T Prime are identical

401
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,720
then the number of edges in the first

402
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:50,159
term is 3 minus P cubed P

403
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:56,200
Cub okay so recall that P is some

404
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,640
quantity that goes to zero as um well it

405
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
doesn't have to go to zero but you know

406
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,919
we uh

407
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,840
p is some quantity that um you know for

408
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,159
now you can think of as going to zero so

409
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,159
that the first term is always

410
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,279
dominant even if p is constant up to a

411
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,480
constant Factor still the first term is

412
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,480
is

413
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,320
dominant okay so let us now continue the

414
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:25,360
earlier convers the earlier computation

415
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,159
and we see that this sum is equal to the

416
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,480
following there are uh we need to think

417
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,919
about

418
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,880
how each of these cases can arise now

419
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,679
the first case contributes zero to the

420
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,120
sum so we don't have to worry about it

421
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,480
the second term the second possibility

422
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,320
contributes the following it

423
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,960
contributes n choose two but we need to

424
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,919
count how many different configurations

425
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,480
can we have like this where you have

426
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,520
these two you know the the red and the

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,520
blue triangles overlapping by an edge so

428
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,039
this n choose two for the two

429
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,039
overlapping vertices and n *

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,039
nus * N - 2 * N -

431
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,039
3 for the remaining

432
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,039
two

433
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,520
vertices and in this case we have P to 5

434
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,840
minus P to

435
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,679
the

436
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:30,360
6 okay and then the third

437
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,360
possibility and choose

438
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,360
3 time P cubed minus P to the 6

439
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,360
power

440
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,080
okay this is some expression and we only

441
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,600
need to get some bounds so we can play

442
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,559
around with astics and not think about

443
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,399
constant factors so we'll basically

444
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,600
ignore the constant factors and do an

445
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:01,080
upper bound so up to a constant Factor

446
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,320
so Big O the first term here involves n

447
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,279
to the 4th

448
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,520
P fifth power okay so we can ignore the

449
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:10,159
the the negative contributions they they

450
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,080
don't matter for this

451
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:17,440
calculation and then the second term

452
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:20,600
here is n

453
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,080
cubed P cubed and most on the order of n

454
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,080
cubed P

455
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,080
cubed

456
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,919
and Okay so under the hypothesis that NP

457
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,919
goes to

458
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,960
Infinity both these terms are little o

459
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,240
of n to the 6 P to the 6 okay so that's

460
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,600
something that one can check from the

461
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,600
from the

462
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:56,880
hypothesis

463
00:25:50,919 --> 00:26:00,200
thus the variance of X is little o of

464
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,600
the expectation of x^

465
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,360
s and so by the

466
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,600
corollary of CHF

467
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,760
earlier we see

468
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:18,399
that with probability approaching

469
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:21,840
One X is positive so that there's

470
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:24,440
typically this random graph contains a

471
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,200
triangle and that finishes the proof of

472
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,000
the second part this theorem one right

473
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,080
so to recap

474
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,919
we

475
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,840
showed that 1 / N is a threshold for the

476
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,080
property of the random graph GN P to

477
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,159
contain a triangle so that statement has

478
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,679
two parts the first part is that when p

479
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,880
is quite small it's much smaller than 1/

480
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,200
n then typically this random graph does

481
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,000
not contain a triangle and the way we

482
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,360
establish this fact is by showing that

483
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,760
the number of triangles not X the number

484
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,600
of triangles has expected value going to

485
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,039
zero and thus by Markov

486
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,240
inequality this number of triangles is

487
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,440
zero with high

488
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,360
probability the second

489
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,840
part where P now is much larger than 1 /

490
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,399
M here the expected number of triangles

491
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,960
goes to Infinity as n goes to Infinity U

492
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,840
but that alone does not allow us to

493
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,399
conclude that the number of triangles is

494
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,039
positive typically

495
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,559
instead we'll need to apply a second

496
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,919
moment argument to show that the number

497
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,120
of triangles is typically concentrated

498
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,600
around its mean and that was a

499
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,039
calculation that we did this was a

500
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,200
second moment calculation namely

501
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,760
understanding and Computing the variance

502
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,200
of this random variable and showing that

503
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,600
the variance is much smaller than the

504
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,720
square of the

505
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,440
expectation from which then we can use

506
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,519
chabby shf inequality to deduce that the

507
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,519
number of triang go is typically

508
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:05,200
positive right and combining these two

509
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:09,039
proofs together we obtain this threshold

510
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,320
statement now what we just showed is a

511
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:16,039
important but fairly basic application

512
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,679
of using probalistic methods to

513
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:22,080
understand typicality statements and

514
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:25,840
these types of uh statements and proof

515
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,799
techniques are quite ubiquitous in

516
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,840
studies involving the probabilistic

517
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:35,279
method and Beyond and there are much

518
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,080
more difficult results of similar flavor

519
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,760
but they involved much more Advanced

520
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,559
Techniques and what you saw here is

521
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,919
simply a taste of what such a statement

522
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,919
and its technique could look like
