a global and National crisis that cannot

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
be solved by City governments alone but

24
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,560
cities suffering from it can try to

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,119
enact new policies reducing emissions

and more as we near the end of this

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,560
historically hot summer MIT news talked

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,759
to Sue about what cities are now doing

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,799
in response to record Heat and the

41
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,920
possibilities for new policy measures

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,040
question we've had record setting

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
temperatures in many cities across the

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,439
US this summer dealing with climate

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,640
change certainly isn't just the

46
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,840
responsibility of those cities but what

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,920
have they been doing to make a

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,640
difference to the extent they can answer

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,679
I think this is a very top of- mind

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,599
question because even 10 or 15 years ago

51
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,200
we talked about adapting to a changed

52
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,160
climate future which seemed further off

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,879
but literally every week this summer we

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,040
can refer to dramatic things that are

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,920
already happening clearly linked to

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
climate change and are going to get

57
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,560
worse we had Wildfire smoke in the

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
Northeast and throughout the Eastern

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,319
Seaboard in June this tragic wildfire in

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Hawaii that led to more deaths than any

61
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,800
other wild in the US plus record high

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
temperatures a lot of city leaders face

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,760
climate challenges they thought were

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,360
maybe 20 or 30 years in the future and

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,800
didn't expect to see happen with this

66
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,640
severity and intensity one thing you're

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,440
seeing is changes in governance a lot of

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,040
cities have recently appointed a chief

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,040
heat officer Miami and Phoenix have them

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,080
now and this is someone responsible for

71
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,800
coordinating response to heat waves

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
which turn out to be one of the biggest

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Killers among climatological effects

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,599
there is an increasing real ization not

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,239
only among local governments but

76
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,319
insurance companies and the building

77
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,920
industry that flooding is going to

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,120
affect many places we have already seen

79
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,440
flooding in the Seaport area in Boston

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,560
the most recently built part of our city

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,720
in some sense just the realization among

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,080
local governments insurers building

83
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,440
owners and residents that some risks are

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,799
here and now already is changing how

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,360
people think about those risks question

86
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,360
to what extent does a city being active

87
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,640
about climate change at least signal to

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,280
everyone at the state or national level

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,159
that we have to do more at the same time

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
some states are reacting against cities

91
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,799
that are trying to Institute climate

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,720
initiatives and trying to prevent clean

93
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,879
energy advances what is possible at this

94
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,480
point answer we have this very large

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,360
heterogeneous and polarized country and

96
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,239
we have differences between States and

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,439
within States in how they're approaching

98
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,280
climate change you've got some cities

99
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,360
trying to enact things like natural gas

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,439
banss or trying to limit greenhouse gas

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,959
emissions

102
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,280
with some state governments trying to

103
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,439
preempt them entirely I think cities

104
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,159
have a role in showing leadership but

105
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,519
one thing I harp on having worked in

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,959
city government myself is that sometimes

107
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,760
in cities we can be complacent while we

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,600
pride ourselves on being centers of

109
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,440
innovation and less per capita emissions

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
we're using less than rural areas and

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,880
you'll see people celebrating New York

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,600
City as the greenest in the world cities

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,759
are responsible for consumption that

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,039
produces a majority of emissions in most

115
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,720
countries if we're going to decarbonize

116
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,919
society we have to get to zero

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,240
altogether and that requires cities to

118
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,240
act much more aggressively there's not

119
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,400
only a pessimistic narrative with the

120
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,000
inflation reduction act which is rapidly

121
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,360
accelerating the production of renewable

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,280
energy you see many of those subsidies

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,639
going to build new Manufacturing in red

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,520
States there's a possibility people will

125
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,600
see there are plenty of better paying

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,240
less dangerous jobs in clean energy

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,800
people don't like monopolies wherever

128
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,600
they live so even places people consider

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
fairly conservative would like local

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,759
control of energy and that might mean

131
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,759
Greener jobs and lower prices yes there

132
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,080
is a doom scrolling Loop of thinking

133
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,800
polarization is insurmountable but I

134
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,800
feel surprisingly optimistic sometimes

135
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,320
large parts of the Midwest even in

136
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,520
places people think of as being more

137
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,639
conservative have chosen to build a lot

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,319
of wind energy partly because it's

139
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,479
profitable historically some farmers

140
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,960
were self-reliant and had wind power

141
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,520
before the electrical grid came even now

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,199
in some places where people don't want

143
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,479
to address climate change they're more

144
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,639
than happy to have wind power

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,479
question you've published work on which

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
cities can pursue which policies to

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,960
reduce emissions the most better housing

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,039
construction more Transit more fuel

149
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,520
efficient vehicles possibly higher

150
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,039
housing density and more the exact

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,680
recipe varies from place to place but

152
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,720
what are the common threads people can

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
think about answer it's important to

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,680
think about what the status quo is and

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,759
what we should be preparing for the

156
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,039
status quo simply doesn't serve large

157
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,319
parts of the population right now heat

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,160
risk flood flooding and wildfires all

159
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,120
disproportionately affect populations

160
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,440
that are already vulnerable if you're

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
elderly or lack access to Mobility

162
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,479
information or Warnings you probably

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,800
have a lower risk of surviving a

164
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,880
wildfire many people do not have

165
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,120
highquality housing and may be more

166
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,039
exposed to heat or smoke we know the

167
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,039
climate has already changed and is going

168
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,880
to change more but we have failed to

169
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,960
prepare for foreseeable changes that are

170
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,680
already here lots of things that are

171
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,319
climate related but not only about

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,319
climate change like affordable housing

173
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,199
Transportation energy access for

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,039
everyone so they can have services like

175
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,319
cooking and the internet those are

176
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,080
things that we can change going forward

177
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,280
the hopeful message is cities are always

178
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,199
changing and being built so we should

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,479
make them better the Urgent messages we

180
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,479
shouldn't accept the status quo
