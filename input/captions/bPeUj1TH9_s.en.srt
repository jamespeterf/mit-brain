00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,120
hello everyone my name is Derek Miller

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,279
I'm the vice president of platform

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,600
research here at deepure and I'm excited

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,080
to talk a little bit about some of the

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,559
things we've been working on so deepure

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,519
was founded at the MIT media lab six

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,279
years ago and since then we've raised

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,920
over $70 million we have over 30

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,199
employees we've started an automated

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
chemistry lab that can handle multi-step

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,000
synthesis and we have three drug

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,439
Discovery programs one which will be

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,800
starting clinical trial in

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,879
2025 and that is our brd4 bd2 program we

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,480
have multiple exciting indications that

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:39,440
we're looking into um we also have stat

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,719
6 which uh is entering late stage

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,800
Discovery we have a a couple exciting

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,440
scaffolds there we have an undisclosed

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,600
Target which we'll be announcing very

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,520
soon when we approach our pipeline we

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,359
have two things that we look at one

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,039
we're looking for an un unmet need in

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,239
the clinical setting that has validated

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,359
biology and two we're looking for

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,120
targets that have particular medal

27
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,680
chemistry challenges that we think our

28
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,240
next Generation AI platform is built to

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,159
solve so with that in mind immune

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,560
targets became an obvious uh uh option

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,600
for us to Target one because they tend

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,960
to have protein protein interactions um

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,439
these typically require larger and 3D

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
molecules a lot of these proteins also

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,400
have highly charged surfaces with

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,360
hydrophobic surrounding areas making it

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,840
incredibly difficult to build a

38
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,399
drug-like small molecule for or they

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,159
have very precise Target selectivity

40
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,200
issues so precise that even at times it

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,200
can be the difference between a

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,920
non-toxic uh uh outcome or or or toxic

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,439
outcome and these these types of

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,600
problems and going after these targets

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,399
are very difficult and most AI

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,439
methodologies struggle here for two

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,320
different reasons one if there's no data

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,039
at all um we've we've heard about data

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,920
sets and models uh um consistently it's

50
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,399
very difficult to go after these targets

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,840
with no data there's no binding mode to

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
understand there's no starting chemical

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
matter if we're going after an alisic

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,200
site there's no you know peptide or

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
anything that we can use as a basis

56
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,239
second if there is data sometimes that

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
can be worse because you get stuck in

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,319
local Minima trying to design around a

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,560
compound or a peptide and fulfill its

60
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,239
interactions that may be impossible to

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,560
build a drug for with that in mind

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,840
deepure has developed a technology to

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,760
address both of those issues and at the

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,319
heart of it we believe that if AI in is

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
going to be in drug Discovery and make

66
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,760
an impact it should make an impact on

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,080
the most challenging

68
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,400
targets with that in mind we have our

69
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,720
pipeline laid out here and it's composed

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,200
of about three different different items

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,400
um we have our pocket expander our

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,400
pocket expander looks at exploring novel

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,840
interactions and opportunities and how

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,879
we can interact with the protein we have

75
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,640
mulen which is our generative AI

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
algorithm um it designs compounds to

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,680
completely fulfill the interactions from

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,720
pocket expander we also in the mulen

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,239
process co-optimize for adme properties

80
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,000
ensuring that we're not going to hit a

81
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,159
liability down the road that's

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,080
immediately obvious and then we have our

83
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,040
inspired chemistry lab which is a

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
completely automated chemistry lab that

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,440
can handle multi-step

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,040
synthesis so the Innovation starts with

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
our pocket expander our pocket expander

88
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,879
looks for novel interactions and this

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,200
goes beyond just hydrogen bonds we're

90
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,080
looking for uh through quantum mechanics

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,640
through molecular Dynamics unique

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,200
interaction opportunities with a protein

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,439
that could deliver the phenotype that

94
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,680
we're trying to address and this will

95
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,159
create multiple hypotheses in how you

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,760
could interact with the protein um most

97
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,319
of the times it can be in in the realm

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,400
of 8 to 10 and we take those hypotheses

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,879
and we use our molecular generation

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
which is our reinforcement learning

101
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,280
algorithm that will try to build a

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,079
compound to fulfill all the novel

103
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,840
interactions and these compounds are

104
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,439
most important importantly not only

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,799
synthesizable with a very high

106
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,360
probability it's also cost effective

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,120
because one of the things we wanted to

108
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,120
do with our model is ensure that it

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,680
produces a synthetic path so it tells

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,439
you exactly how it thinks it should

111
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,280
design the

112
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,320
compound in finally once we've designed

113
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,240
the compound that specifically meets the

114
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,120
interaction needs we can send it to our

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,440
automated chemistry lab which we call

116
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,039
inspired chemistry which has a very high

117
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,240
throughput has 28 different reaction

118
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,840
types which which allows us to explore a

119
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,759
large diversity of of uh molecules and

120
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,120
can handle up to 10 steps very recently

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,280
we had a a completely an automated

122
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,960
setting we showed that we could

123
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,360
synthesize Pax loid um and that we have

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,840
a publication on that or or um output on

125
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,320
that and finally on the partnership

126
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,400
opportunities we're looking for two

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
different areas one's on our inspired

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
chemistry on the platform side when

129
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,639
we're developing new targets we use

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,360
inspired chemistry almost as a customer

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,560
and so we're actually taking customers

132
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,479
specifically for inspired chemistry and

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,960
working with a few to build custom

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,840
synthesis for them second we're looking

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,520
uh you know at collaboration not only on

136
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,880
some of the new challenging targets that

137
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,720
I was defining earlier but some of the

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,280
existing programs um as

139
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,919
well so I want to highlight our team we

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,080
have a diverse set of backgrounds from

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,400
machine learning to computer science to

142
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,840
biology to Medicinal Chemistry and

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,840
automated chemistry um we also have a

144
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,600
great group of leaders ship as well um

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,880
um and yeah thank you again my name's

146
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,120
Derek and if you want to interact

147
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,120
afterwards I'd be happy to
