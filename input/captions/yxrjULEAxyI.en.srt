1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,800
All right. How many of you work at

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,200
companies that develop or maintain

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,759
software? Anyone? All right. Or contract

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,720
out for the development of software.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
Okay. So, we're

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,400
Silverthread and uh we've been around

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,800
for a while helping a lot of companies

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,880
and organizations analyze the health of

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
their software code bases and then

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,960
improve the health of those code bases.

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,480
Specifically, we've been applying MIT

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,280
and Harvard research to look at the

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,880
architectural health of those systems,

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,200
make economic cases for change and um uh

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,680
and then drive results. So, if you look

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
at this graph over here, most software

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,480
development projects, I don't know if

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,160
you any of you have experience with

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,239
this, but they might be a little late,

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,239
right? They might be delayed. They might

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,680
have some challenges and some of them

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
might fail. I don't know if any of you

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
have any of those experiences at all,

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
but but in but most people tell me that

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,399
if that you have a finite amount of

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,359
attention, resources, money to apply to

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,680
your projects and that and if they are

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,640
late or fail then you are wasting a lot

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
of your money. Um, we have worked with

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
companies that have good healthy systems

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,400
and we have worked with companies that

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,280
have

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,759
architecturally extraordinarily

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,240
challenged systems. And if we could

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,400
optimize um by helping people make

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
better decisions around what to keep,

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
what to improve because it's financially

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
rational or it's financially rational to

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,080
do so and it's technically feasible to

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
do so. And if you could, you know, for

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,840
the small number that you want to kill

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
those programs or or, you know, rebuild

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
them, if you could just make that choice

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,400
in an economically rational way, you

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,000
could probably double the rate of

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
innovation within your organizations.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
And that's what we've seen uh over a

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,759
decade within the United States Air

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,720
Force and Space Force doing analysis of

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
the systems that they've

51
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,000
got. So we've got a product called

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
Kodmarai. It's based on the research and

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
development that we did out of MIT and

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,439
are now commercializing. The first

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,840
aspect of it we call discovery. This is

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,600
a tool that can help you analyze the

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
portfolio of applications that you have

58
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,079
within your organization or if you have

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,920
access to code devel of um systems

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,440
developed by others for you or on your

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,479
behalf you have to do some auditing

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,800
maybe you're doing mergers and

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,200
acquisitions you can analyze the health

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,879
benchmark it look at trending over time

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,959
and understand it multi-dimensionally

66
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,959
both technically as well as the business

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,440
implications so we can help you use

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,520
machine learning and AI to look at um

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,879
risk maintainability agility

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,319
productivity of your development ment

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,760
organization as a function of the

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,200
technical health of the code that they

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,360
have to understand and work in and

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
modify without creating bugs. On the

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
other hand, we also have um I guess the

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,720
history of silver thread is we we

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,160
started by um criticizing people's code.

78
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,599
People get defensive. Let's face it, if

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
you go in and you criticize people's

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,040
code, they think you're calling their

81
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
baby ugly. And so, as Silverthread

82
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,239
evolved, we developed this tool called

83
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,760
Codmarai Modernize, which isn't just

84
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,680
about calling your baby ugly. It's about

85
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,640
helping you give your baby a nose job,

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
right? So, how do we how do we help you

87
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,280
um systematically with a roadmap

88
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,599
transform your code bases from something

89
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,120
that's monolithic, hairball, furball,

90
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,200
spaghetti, whatever you want to call it,

91
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,959
into something that is a modular system

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,440
with controlled dependencies, good

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,959
hierarchies, good APIs, um and a

94
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,480
structured way of doing that in a

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
quantitative fashion where everyone can

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,200
audit it and the engineers have the

97
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,120
information they need. Um here's an

98
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
example. This is a portfolio from the

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,080
United States Air Force and Space Force

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,280
of hundreds of systems that we've looked

101
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,480
at. So you can see some are in the

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,560
green, some are in the red, some are um

103
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,799
in the middle in the yellow. Um and

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
we're doing uh predictions. We're doing

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
benchmarks both around the technical

106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,239
health of the system. We can track it

107
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
over time and we're also looking at

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
metrics around the productivity of

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,599
developers, the defect density, you

110
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,120
know, things like that, things of

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,200
economic value that the business people

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
are going to care

113
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,640
about. Um, codmarai modernize is more

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
about how do you take your system and

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,799
structure it well? How do you um define

116
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,400
the architecture as your experts would

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
want it to be? And then look for

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
deviations. Like let's say you've got

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
someone with 20 years of experience

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,159
leading a project, but you hired a

121
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
summer intern and they start adding

122
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
things in bad places. You want the

123
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319
person with 20 years of experience to

124
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
know that that's going on that day

125
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,519
instead of 5 years from now so that you

126
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,200
can prevent it and so you can remediate.

127
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,120
So partnering with us, the first thing

128
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,239
that I would I would propose is we're

129
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,320
looking for people who would be

130
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,919
interested in running code discovery. It

131
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,199
is a package that can be installed on

132
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,840
Windows or Linux inside your

133
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,759
organization and without any handholding

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,320
analyze as many code bases as you throw

135
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,160
at it. Do some benchmarking just see the

136
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,360
results, get a pilot. We'd be very

137
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,880
interested in working with people who

138
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,759
have one codebase that's really

139
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,520
important or lots of systems so that you

140
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
can see the difference on different

141
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
dimensions uh within them and then see

142
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
how that relates to how well those

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,080
projects are going. And on the other

144
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
hand, we've developed a lot of AI based

145
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,160
technology over the years, whether it's

146
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
graph theoretic, machine learning, you

147
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
know, statistical, you know, other types

148
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,280
of things that we've been employing, but

149
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
a lot of the new AI stuff that's coming

150
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,440
out, uh, can be applied and we'd be

151
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,360
interested in working with people who

152
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,960
are interested in that kind of research.

153
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,040
You know, how do you take a large scale

154
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,880
system, 20 million lines of code, tear

155
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,720
it down and rebuild it in a more

156
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,919
automated fashion? That's beyond the

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
current state-of-the-art, but it's

158
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,360
something that we're interested in

159
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
pursuing. So, with that, um, I'll take

160
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
any questions that you might have, but

161
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
we're going to have a table outside, so

162
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,360
I'd appreciate it if you would stop by.

163
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,759
Uh, you mentioned that it installs on a

164
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
Windows machine, but I'm just curious on

165
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
the logistics. So, you put it on a

166
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
machine here, and then you've got code

167
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
bases that may be running on maybe a

168
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
mid-range or a mainframe someplace else.

169
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
How does it get access to look at that

170
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
code? Our software application can be

171
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,199
installed on any computer inside your

172
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,800
organization. So, if you've got, it just

173
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,560
needs access to the code to scan it. So

174
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
as long as it can point at code should

175
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,240
have to bring down the code from

176
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,160
whatever platform it is onto that

177
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
Windows. So some of our customers ship

178
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
us code. Others of our customers are in

179
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,840
secure environments where for national

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
security reasons that code is not ever

181
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,639
we're never even going to see it. So

182
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,919
they'll install it in an airgapped

183
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,960
environment. So we can do everything in

184
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,960
between. Okay. Thanks.

185
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,919
No. Most people are squirly about their

186
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
source code getting out.

187
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,360
So they they get really upset about that

188
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,639
kind of thing.

189
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,479
Yeah. So can you talk a little more

190
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
about how you keep that integrity

191
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,680
software integrity for organizations

192
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,360
while uh using the AI generated code?

193
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,360
Oh, so um our tooling can run completely

194
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
self-contained for people in secure

195
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,560
environments like banks or department of

196
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
defense. Um it doesn't need to, you

197
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
know, typically our typical installation

198
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
will make a connection for a license

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
server, but that's not even required if

200
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
if you're in a highly secure

201
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,639
environment.

202
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,639
Okay, thank you then. Okay.
