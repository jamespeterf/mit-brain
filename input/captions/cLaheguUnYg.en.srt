1
00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:03,429
Thank you, everyone, for
joining us for today's session.

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:06,269
If you have any questions
throughout today's presentation,

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,279
feel free to use
the Q&A feature.

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,897
My colleagues will be answering
some questions there virtually,

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,857
and then we'll also
answer some questions live

6
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,767
at the end of today's event.

7
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:17,454
As you just saw in
the video, hopefully,

8
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:20,581
you got a feel for the
culture and community

9
00:00:20,665 --> 00:00:23,905
that is at the Sloan
School of Management.

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,550
Part of what we do in the
Sloan School of Management

11
00:00:26,592 --> 00:00:30,272
is developing principled,
innovative leaders who

12
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:32,997
improve the world, and
generating ideas that

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,819
advance management practice.

14
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,634
This is our mission
statement and truly

15
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:38,926
at the heart of everything
that we do within the Sloan

16
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:40,266
School of Management.

17
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,308
As you think about the
first part of our mission,

18
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:44,371
developing principled,
innovative leaders

19
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:45,811
who improve the world.

20
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:48,093
This is done particularly
through our portfolio

21
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,398
of programs.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,140
We have a variety of programs
offered for various points

23
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,465
in your students careers,
from early career

24
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:59,367
programs to mid-career programs
like our Sloan Fellows MBA

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,700
and our Executive MBA program.

26
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:05,526
Today, we're here to share more
about our Sloan Fellows MBA,

27
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:09,018
which we often refer to as the
SFMBA program here at Sloan.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,580
Our Sloan Fellows MBA
program is a fully immersive

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,600
one-year experience.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
At the end of the
12 months, students

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,160
get one of three
degrees either an MBA,

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,840
a master's in management, or
a masters in the management

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,100
of technology.

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,260
For those that pursue one
of the master's degrees,

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,680
they also complete a thesis
during their 12 months

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,000
on campus.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,120
The degree is really focused
on the science of Management

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,080
and data driven
decisions, with principles

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,280
of innovation and
entrepreneurship and everything

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,000
that we do.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,760
The Sloan Fellows MBA
program is a global community

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,040
with over 40 countries
represented every year,

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,560
and a lot of global perspectives
brought into the classroom.

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,500
As a Sloan Fellows MBA student,
you're also an MIT student.

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,720
And so you have access, not
just to Sloan resources,

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,000
but resources across the
broader MIT Institute.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,680
And the Sloan
Fellows MBA program

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,200
is really designed to be
flexible and customizable so

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,680
that regardless of where you're
coming into the program from,

50
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,960
there are a lot of
opportunities and experiences

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,480
for you to engage and customize
that degree to exactly what you

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,940
need based on those
previous experiences,

53
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,228
but also where you want to
go after in your career.

54
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:24,520
So today's agenda, I'm going
to share a little bit more

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,540
about the curriculum of the
Sloan Fellows MBA program.

56
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,560
We'll talk about the community
aspects, career development

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,040
and support services,
and then go into Q&A

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,660
at the end of today's event.

59
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,720
Again, feel free to use the Q&A
feature to pose any questions

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
to my team, and then we'll
answer some questions

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,228
live at the end of the session.

62
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:48,520
So let's talk about the
curriculum of the Sloan Fellows

63
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,320
MBA program.

64
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,840
Starting in the first
semester, students

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,120
have a strong emphasis on
teamwork and collaboration.

66
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,880
You are put into a variety
of groups, a learning

67
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,760
team in a study group
in your first semester

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
to really have an
additional support

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,360
system within the broader
Sloan Fellows MBA program.

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,760
You will support each other
throughout the 12 months

71
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,440
in this network
that you're building

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,520
during your time will
be a network that you'll

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,440
have for the rest of
your careers as well.

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,240
One of the important components
of the Sloan Fellows MBA program

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,140
is a focus on leadership.

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,160
And so you start
establishing the foundations

77
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,040
even before arriving on campus
with a 360 degree leadership

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,820
assessment.

79
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,320
And then throughout
the program, you

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,680
have executive
coaching sessions.

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,360
As I previously
mentioned, students

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,040
pursuing one of the two master's
options will complete a thesis.

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,960
There's also the opportunity to
do a one semester independent

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,600
study for folks that are
interested in additional

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,560
research opportunities.

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,520
So previously, I
talked a little bit

87
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,960
about how the Sloan
Fellows MBA program is

88
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,065
both flexible and customizable.

89
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:00,440
So let's talk about what that
means for the Sloan Fellows

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,520
program.

91
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,800
You have a very
flexible path in that

92
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,720
each student designs their own
path throughout the program,

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
and has a lot of opportunities
to make different choices,

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,160
depending on their experiences.

95
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,880
So all incoming
students will start

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,760
preparing for the classroom
even before arriving on campus.

97
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,220
You'll start getting to know
the other incoming students.

98
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,960
You'll identify various
administrative items,

99
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,020
such as housing and the
student visa process

100
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,200
during the spring time.

101
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,600
All students complete a little
bit of academic prep work,

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,600
and then you'll also do
your 360 leadership survey.

103
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
All of those things
happen before you even

104
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,160
arrive on campus.

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
Once students arrive on campus,
they have an in-person June

106
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,200
orientation.

107
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,880
This is a four-day
period really focused

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,520
on getting you acquainted with
the various resources on campus,

109
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,240
getting you acquainted with
the executive degree program

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,660
team who supports our Sloan
Fellows, MBA students,

111
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,080
and our executive MBA students.

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
And really getting you
acquainted with other folks that

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,200
are in your class and starting
to form that community

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,440
within the Sloan
Fellows program.

115
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,000
After that June
orientation, then you

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
start your summer courses.

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,420
Summer courses are
only core classes.

118
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,720
You'll take seven out of
your nine core classes

119
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,160
during the summer term.

120
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,465
You will not take any
electives during the summer.

121
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:24,840
So the classes
that you're taking

122
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,720
are only with other Sloan
Fellows MBA students.

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,020
There's intensive teamwork.

124
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,400
Again, you'll be developing
learning groups and study

125
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,400
groups to support your
development throughout the 12

126
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
months.

127
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,660
You'll start focusing on
leadership development,

128
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,400
using things such as
your 360 leadership

129
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,040
assessment and
executive coaching

130
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,840
to get started on those
aspects and really building

131
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,800
that learning community
that will support you

132
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
through the 12 months.

133
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,440
This is the only semester
that all of your classes

134
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,640
are with other
Sloan Fellows MBA.

135
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,760
And so this is a really
important semester

136
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,520
to really build that
community within the cohort.

137
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,160
After the summer term,
you have about a week off

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,760
before your fall
semester courses begin.

139
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,220
Fall is a more lively
time on campus,

140
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,500
as many of our other
programs are starting,

141
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
or some of our
second year students

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
are returning to campus.

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
And so there are a
lot of folks on campus

144
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,080
and a lot of
opportunities to begin

145
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,360
engaging with folks in the
broader portfolio of programs,

146
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,160
such as our masters
of finance students

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
or masters of business analytics
students, two year MBA students.

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
You'll have plenty
of opportunities

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,440
to engage with them,
starting this semester.

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,140
During the fall semester,
you'll take one core class,

151
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,340
and the rest of your
classes will be electives.

152
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,700
Depending on the number
of units that you choose,

153
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,480
you might be taking
anywhere from four to seven

154
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,305
elective courses during
the fall semester.

155
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,680
During this time,
there will also

156
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,040
be frequent interactions
with senior executives

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,540
and entrepreneurs.

158
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,600
And you have the
opportunity to really choose

159
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,480
what teaching method may work
best for your learning style.

160
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,960
There are a variety of
opportunities with classes that

161
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,480
might be lecture or
case-based, they're

162
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,580
project-based learning courses.

163
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,025
Action learning
is a type of class

164
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,900
that I'll talk about in
a little more detail,

165
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,000
but you have the opportunity to
pick from hundreds of electives

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
to really start
crafting the degree.

167
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,000
After the fall semester,
you'll have a few weeks

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
off for your winter break.

169
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,540
And then here across MIT, we
have our independent activities

170
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,880
period.

171
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,200
During this period,
there are a lot

172
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,840
of opportunities
for Sloan Fellows

173
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,560
to engage in a variety of
different types of courses.

174
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,960
Some of those are a
negotiation seminar

175
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,880
that a lot of
Sloan Fellows take,

176
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,240
either six or nine electives.

177
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
That happens during IAP.

178
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,760
There's also the opportunity
to take in January executive

179
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,720
electives.

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,880
These are a unique
offering that are only

181
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,540
available to current Sloan
Fellows, MBA students,

182
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,240
current executive MBA
students, and alumni

183
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,320
of both of the programs.

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,120
They're about two-day courses,
intensive courses where

185
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,502
you focus on a specific
topic, and it's

186
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:09,960
really great for
the learnings that

187
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,040
happen in the class, but also
a really great opportunity

188
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,640
for further networking beyond
your cohort in the Sloan Fellows

189
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,720
MBA.

190
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,240
This past January, we
had about over 350 alumni

191
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,960
come back for the January
executive elective period.

192
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,520
During IAP, students
might who are pursuing

193
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,039
one of the master's
degrees will continue

194
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,360
working on their thesis.

195
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,640
And then there may
be opportunities

196
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,039
for international
experiences, whether formally

197
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,919
through action learning
labs or informally

198
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,040
through opportunities
with your classmates

199
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,480
or in the broader
Sloan community.

200
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,720
After IAP students
have a spring semester.

201
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,580
Again, you take one core class
during the spring semester,

202
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,000
and the rest of your
classes are electives.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,120
Again, you're choosing
from hundreds of courses

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,840
to really design the degree
to what you need it to be.

205
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,620
And then students
graduate in May.

206
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,860
So a lot is packed
into 12 months.

207
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,400
A lot of opportunities
and experiences.

208
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,070
And then students go
off into the world.

209
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,800
Many students choose
to remain in the US,

210
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,560
and some might be
returning to their home

211
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,720
countries or the countries
that they were living in

212
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,280
prior to the program.

213
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,840
This is just a snapshot of
some of the popular electives

214
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,680
that Sloan Fellows
have taken in the past.

215
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
And you'll notice
some of the offerings

216
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,380
might be Sloan
Fellows MBA specific,

217
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,520
such as strategic
leadership communication.

218
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,880
A lot of the other offerings
are open to students

219
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,620
across the portfolio
of programs.

220
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,840
So again, a lot of
opportunities not just

221
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,320
to form community with
the Sloan Fellows MBA,

222
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
but also forming
community and connections

223
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,640
in the broader Sloan ecosystem.

224
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,920
So we've talked about
that flexible path

225
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,080
and how students have
various points of opportunity

226
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,865
to choose what classes
they're taking.

227
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:03,240
Let's talk about
some of the ways

228
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,800
that students might
customize the degree.

229
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,980
There are a variety of ways.

230
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,000
The first one is
through certificates.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,780
So as a Sloan
Fellows MBA student,

232
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,740
you could pursue up to two
certificates during your time.

233
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,400
It does take a lot of time
management and proactive

234
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,880
planning to do that, but
it certainly is possible.

235
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,760
We have seven certificates in
business analytics, enterprise

236
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,480
management, entrepreneurship
and innovation, finance, health,

237
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,680
product management,
and sustainability.

238
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,640
These certificates require
45 units of electives

239
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,740
to be focused on
that specific topic.

240
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,800
And typically, a
certificate requires

241
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,480
two to three specific
courses and then two to three

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,502
elective offerings in
a broader category.

243
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,960
For folks that are looking to
make a change in their career

244
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,660
and move into one
of these spaces,

245
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,700
it can be a great signifier
to a future client,

246
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,000
a future co-founder,
or future employer.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
Your dedication to that topic.

248
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Oftentimes, we find
that Sloan Fellows MBAs

249
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,520
might use these
certificates as a path

250
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,800
that they're following or
choosing some electives from,

251
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
rather than pursuing
certificates,

252
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,720
because your interests might
lie across various topics.

253
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,360
Students can also customize the
degree through action learning.

254
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
And this is a
teaching method where

255
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,297
students are applying the
theories and frameworks

256
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,880
that they're learning
in the classroom

257
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,720
to a real-world
business challenge.

258
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,500
You work with a
real organization

259
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,160
solving a specific challenge.

260
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,640
Some of these
action learning labs

261
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,580
are focused on
specific industries,

262
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,920
some are focused on
specific functions,

263
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,020
some are focused on specific
geographic contexts,

264
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,960
and some are more
interdisciplinary.

265
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,840
I'll give you a snapshot of what
the current action learning labs

266
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,040
look like and when they run
during the academic year.

267
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,120
Some additional resources
for customization.

268
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,940
As the Sloan
Fellows MBA student,

269
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,920
you can cross cross-register
courses in the broader MIT

270
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,178
ecosystem and even at Harvard.

271
00:11:58,178 --> 00:11:59,720
So there are additional
opportunities

272
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,040
for that customization.

273
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,680
Getting involved in various
research centers across MIT

274
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,240
can also broaden that horizon
and customize the degree

275
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,220
a little bit more.

276
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,120
This is a snapshot of the
current action learning labs.

277
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,840
You'll see a variety
of ones listed here.

278
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,640
One-- some of these
action learning labs

279
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,520
have travel components.

280
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,120
For instance, Global
Entrepreneurship lab

281
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,760
is a fall semester course that
happened that runs through IAP.

282
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,520
And so during IAP,
students typically

283
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,440
spend two to three weeks on
site with the host organization.

284
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,940
Since they're working with
companies in emerging markets,

285
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,360
students are literally
all over the world

286
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,920
during IAP for that class.

287
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,185
So a lot of opportunities
for that hands on learning

288
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,560
and for students
that are looking

289
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,740
to make some sort of
change in their career.

290
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,440
These are really
great opportunities

291
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,360
to explore in a safe
environment and try out

292
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,640
some new, innovative ideas and
propose solutions that hopefully

293
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
will be implemented in the work
that these organizations are

294
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,000
doing.

295
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,720
So we've talked a little
bit about the curriculum,

296
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,000
the flexible path, and
how students customize it.

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,160
Let's talk a little bit
about the community.

298
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,080
I think the Sloan Fellows MBA is
certainly not just what you're

299
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,060
doing in the classroom.

300
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,080
It's a lot of what you're doing
outside the classroom as well.

301
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,080
And there's a strong emphasis on
the community within the Sloan

302
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,600
Fellows MBA, but also the
broader Sloan community.

303
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,880
Our students come from
all over the world.

304
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,080
This changes year over year.

305
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,560
This is the current
classes makeup

306
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,250
where they came to us from.

307
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,360
So in terms of student life for
our Sloan Fellows, MBA students,

308
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,880
oftentimes, given
where students are

309
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,900
at in their careers and
their personal lives,

310
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,160
they may be joining
the program with folks

311
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
that are supporting
them, whether it's

312
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
children, Significant Others,
which we refer to as SOs.

313
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,840
A lot of students are entering
the program with that support

314
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,680
system, whether the
support system is

315
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,560
coming with them to
Cambridge or staying home,

316
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,300
students figure out
what is best for them.

317
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,820
For those that are
bringing SOs and families,

318
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,640
there is a very
intentional effort

319
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,240
to create community
for those folks.

320
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,960
And so there are
specific programming

321
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,620
for SOs and families.

322
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,360
And then a lot of
the programming

323
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,940
that's designed for our Fellows
is open to SOs and families.

324
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,280
An example of this when students
return after their short break

325
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,800
before the fall semester,
they have a welcome back

326
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,600
to campus event, typically
on a Sunday that's

327
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,020
open to families and students.

328
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,580
Oftentimes, it's a picnic.

329
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,140
Sometimes there may be
additional add-ons to that.

330
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,560
In previous years, they've
had the opportunity

331
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
to go to the Museum of
Science, which is right down

332
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,640
the road from Sloan.

333
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,800
And so that was open
to SOs and families

334
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
to really build that community.

335
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,920
There are some other events.

336
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,680
There's often an
event downtown that's

337
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,280
like a gala that is typically
just open to Fellows and SOs

338
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,160
no children at
that, but there are

339
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,360
a variety of different
co-curricular programmings

340
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,260
to ensure that community is
built not just with the Fellows,

341
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,960
but with those that are here
supporting them as well.

342
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Outside of that,
our students get

343
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,180
involved in a variety of
different conferences,

344
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,200
competitions, hackathons
throughout the MIT ecosystem.

345
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,480
One of our current
Sloan Fellows is

346
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,840
leading the energy conference,
which is the largest student led

347
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,040
energy conference in the world.

348
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,660
And that is MIT focused.

349
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,920
Some of our students are
involved in Sloan specific

350
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,860
conferences or involved
in MIT $100K competition,

351
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,560
delta V accelerator, and other
opportunities within the Martin

352
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,160
Trust Center.

353
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,080
As we think about the
different experiences

354
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,760
that Sloan fellow
students are having they

355
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,720
engage in one of in three
different areas, the first one

356
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,200
being the MIT ecosystem.

357
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,980
As a Sloan Fellows MBA student,
you're also an MIT student,

358
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,880
so you're able to join
the hundreds of MIT clubs

359
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,560
and organizations.

360
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,240
You can get involved in
a variety of research

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,620
and innovation centers.

362
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,840
Some popular ones are CSAIL,
the Martin Trust Center

363
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,280
media, the MIT Media Lab.

364
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,440
As you think.

365
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,840
On a smaller scale,
within the Sloan School,

366
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,680
we have over 80 student led
clubs and organizations.

367
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,660
These clubs range from
focused on culture and arts,

368
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,040
to sports and recreation,
to specific industries

369
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,400
or functions.

370
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,280
So a variety of opportunities
and experiences to be

371
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,640
had in those.

372
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,780
And then within the Sloan
Fellows MBA program,

373
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,520
there's also a lot of
opportunity for leadership

374
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,700
and extracurriculars.

375
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,760
And so there are a lot of
co-curricular activities

376
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,119
that are designed to enhance
the cohort experience for Sloan

377
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,839
Fellows students.

378
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,980
Some of these committees
include a career committee,

379
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,680
which brings in folks that
have roles that are available

380
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,760
specifically for folks at a
similar point in their career.

381
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,800
As a Sloan Fellows
MBA students, there

382
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,400
are muddy talks which happen
throughout the whole academic

383
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,080
year, where every
Friday, two students

384
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,260
give a talk on their
experiences, their life,

385
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,240
whatever they want to
share with their cohort.

386
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,100
There is a women's committee.

387
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,480
There is a New York City
module committee and ADC module

388
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,280
committee.

389
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,880
Our Sloan Fellows are going
to New York City next week

390
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,600
during SIP week.

391
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,360
And this is an opportunity where
you're not taking your fall

392
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,040
semester courses, and
it's an opportunity

393
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,100
to engage more intentionally
in leadership and ethics.

394
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,120
As the focus of this
New York City module,

395
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,180
students opt into this, but most
students choose to opt into it.

396
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,000
And the committee for this
provides co-curricular offerings

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,120
outside of the
leadership and speaker

398
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,640
series that will happen
throughout that module.

399
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,300
The DC module is
similarly structured,

400
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,240
where students meet with
executives and various folks

401
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,780
in leadership roles.

402
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,140
And then there's also additional
co-curricular offerings.

403
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,160
Oftentimes, you're
networking with Sloan Fellows

404
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,360
and executive MBA alumni who
are in those areas as well.

405
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,440
So a lot of
opportunities to have

406
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,080
an impact on the experiences
that the cohort is

407
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
having as well.

408
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,740
So we've talked a little
bit about the curriculum.

409
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,720
We've talked about
the community aspects.

410
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
A lot of Sloan Fellows,
MBAs are joining the program

411
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,880
to make some change
in their career.

412
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,240
So let's talk about what
support resources are

413
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,240
available for students.

414
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,880
As I mentioned before, students
have executive coaching

415
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,960
throughout the entire
Sloan Fellows MBA program.

416
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,720
Students are able to work one on
one with these executive coach

417
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,040
to help identify your
strengths, your vision,

418
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,240
make sure you have
clarity in what you're

419
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,880
hoping to get out
of the program,

420
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
and move on to in
your career next.

421
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,560
And executive coaches really
use that 360 leadership

422
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,320
survey as a starting point
for those conversations.

423
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,120
You can choose to work
with one specific executive

424
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,080
coach or multiple
throughout your time.

425
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,880
As a Sloan student,
you also have access

426
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,360
to MIT Sloan industry advisors.

427
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,480
These are alumni experts
across more than 17 industries

428
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,840
that can really provide that
industry specific guidance

429
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,520
and advice.

430
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,120
Students are able
to make appointments

431
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,880
with industry advisors,
similarly as they

432
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,360
do to career coaches,
and they're there

433
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,400
to really provide that
additional guidance

434
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,600
but also help with
networking and connections.

435
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,160
One of the things with
the Sloan Fellows MBA

436
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,180
is that the career process is
very much student-initiated,

437
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,520
and it's very much a networked
job search and just in time

438
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,060
hiring.

439
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,320
So oftentimes, students will
start their very intentional

440
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,440
search in the spring
semester because that's when

441
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
the roles start opening up.

442
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,220
And so you do a lot of prep work
during the summer and the fall,

443
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,080
so that you're prepared for when
those roles do become available.

444
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,580
And a lot of it does
require networking.

445
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,960
And so industry advisors are
a really great opportunity

446
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,080
to expand your network
and specific spaces

447
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,760
so that you're prepared for
the networked job search.

448
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,280
And just overall, the
Career Development Office

449
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,400
is really there to work with you
in partnership of your career

450
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,760
goals, providing
you the resources

451
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,320
and directing you
to new resources

452
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,930
so that you can be successful
in that career search.

453
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,800
And career doesn't just stop
within the Career Development

454
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,340
Office.

455
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,960
There are really opportunities
everywhere throughout Sloan

456
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,720
and MIT for you to explore,
connect, experiment, and really

457
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,400
find that next career path.

458
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,880
And so oftentimes,
students are engaging

459
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,920
in conferences and clubs and
the broader MIT community,

460
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,960
and all of these
resources can really

461
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,880
help as you explore and figure
out what is next for you.

462
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,120
So we've talked a bit about
some of the different aspects

463
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,360
of the program.

464
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Let's talk about
applying to the program.

465
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,040
Our first application deadline
is coming up in just less than

466
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,360
a week on Monday, October
20 at 3:00 PM Eastern time.

467
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,040
That is our first
round one deadline.

468
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,320
We strongly encourage
international applicants

469
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,240
to apply by the
round one deadline.

470
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,197
And as you're thinking
about your application,

471
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,280
there are a variety of
components that you'll have

472
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,800
to submit within
the application,

473
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,920
we require academic transcripts,
a 300-word or less cover letter,

474
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,840
test scores are optional
for the Sloan Fellows MBA.

475
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,240
You'll provide an
introductory video statement

476
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,980
introducing yourself to
your future classmates.

477
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,800
The caveat being your
future classmates

478
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,600
won't ever see that video.

479
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
It's just for us in the
admissions committee

480
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
to get to know you better.

481
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,520
You'll provide one professional
letter of recommendation

482
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,320
an organizational
chart, your resume.

483
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,620
You'll answer two
short answer questions.

484
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,740
The first one's about
your professional goals,

485
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,200
and the second one is about your
general management experience.

486
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,800
You'll answer the world
that shaped you question,

487
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,320
provide contact information
for two additional references,

488
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,460
and respond to video.

489
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,740
Question 2, which is
a randomly generated,

490
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,400
open ended question
that you'll have

491
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,520
about ten seconds to prepare
for in 60 seconds to record.

492
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,960
All of these materials
are due by the deadline.

493
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,080
So as you're thinking about who
to ask to be your recommender,

494
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,160
make sure that they know
the deadline that they

495
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,560
have to submit it by as well.

496
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,100
And we just want to
give a little caveat.

497
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,520
If you are submitting your
application around 3:00 PM

498
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,080
on the deadline day, and you
have a few components to upload

499
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,880
or your video to do, the
system can be slower close

500
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,860
to the deadline time.

501
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,480
So just have a little
patience with the system.

502
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,200
And we're happy to
work with you if there

503
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,260
are any technical difficulties
during that time as well.

504
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,160
Once applicants apply, we
review all applications

505
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,780
and then we invite a subset
of folks to interview with us.

506
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,260
All interviews are
conducted virtually.

507
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,000
And applicants respond to
one short answer question

508
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
prior to the interview.

509
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,120
Details of that question
and how to submit that

510
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,990
will be included in an
interview invitation email.

511
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,740
So this is a glimpse
of our current class.

512
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,960
We had 116 students
start in June this year.

513
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Students entered the program.

514
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,780
The top three industries were
finance, technology, government,

515
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,800
education, and nonprofit.

516
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,080
In terms of where
students were coming from,

517
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,980
I previously had up
the globe, the world,

518
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,700
and where folks were coming
from with different percentages.

519
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,200
We have 42 countries
represented, 75% of our students

520
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,920
are international, and
25% of our students

521
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,000
are US or permanent residents.

522
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,060
Students entered the program
with 14 years of experience

523
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,800
on average, less than
a third of our class

524
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,640
had a previous advanced
degree, and you'll

525
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,760
see some additional
statistics listed here.

526
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
Hopefully, this gives
you a good glimpse

527
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,480
of what the current class
looks like, and also

528
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,760
allows you to envision yourself
in the Sloan Fellows MBA

529
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,600
program one day.

530
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,273
So we covered a lot,
and I'm sure there

531
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:19,440
have been a lot of questions
that have been answered

532
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,760
in the Q&A. I invite my
colleague Catherine to join me

533
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,040
for any additional questions
that we have in the Q&A

534
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,200
that we weren't able to get to.

535
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,060
Yes, thank you, Madi so
much for the presentation.

536
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,480
That definitely
covered quite a bit.

537
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,720
We do have a few
questions in there

538
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,560
that I would like to share.

539
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,440
One is what type of
resources does a Sloan fellow

540
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,780
have that's not just at the
School of Management at Sloan?

541
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,880
Are they able to engage with
other departments or conferences

542
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,440
outside of Sloan?

543
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Yeah, absolutely.

544
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,180
As Sloan student, you're
also an MIT student.

545
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,120
And so we want students to
engage as much in the resources

546
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,480
at MIT as they do at Sloan.

547
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,022
And so we certainly
encourage it.

548
00:26:10,022 --> 00:26:11,480
There are a variety
of students who

549
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,000
are involved in different
research initiatives

550
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
across the Institute.

551
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,280
There are a number
of students this year

552
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,680
who are Fellows within the--

553
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,720
I'm forgetting the name of it.

554
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,080
I apologize.

555
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,220
It used to be Legatum.

556
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,100
What's the new name?

557
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,300
Catherine, do you remember?

558
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,650
It's like the sharper.

559
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,060
Yeah.

560
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,080
They're focused on
entrepreneurship

561
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,420
in emerging markets.

562
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,260
So there are a few students who
are Fellows within that space.

563
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,240
In addition to being a part
of the Sloan Fellows MBA.

564
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,160
Like I mentioned, one of
our current Sloan Fellows

565
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,960
is one of the folks leading
the energy conference at MIT.

566
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,820
And so definitely a
lot of opportunities.

567
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,400
It does take a
little proactiveness

568
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,120
on the student's part to
engage with those, but plenty

569
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,220
of opportunities.

570
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,900
And oftentimes, if you talk
with any of our students,

571
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,640
they'll say there are far more
opportunities than you will

572
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,340
have the time to engage with.

573
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,600
And so thinking about
what's most important to you

574
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,960
and engaging with
but we encourage

575
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,180
as you have the bandwidth to do
all that you're interested in.

576
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,680
Great.

577
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,080
Thank you.

578
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,840
And for those who
are joining today

579
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,880
that have military
experience, what's

580
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,440
the best way for them to
share that in the application

581
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,320
and part?

582
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah, there are a
few different ways.

583
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,020
If you are currently involved
in your military service,

584
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,840
including that on your resume
in the employment section.

585
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,880
And that would also show up
in your organizational chart.

586
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,120
If you're not
currently serving, you

587
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,000
can still include it
in all of those spaces.

588
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,360
Definitely, including
it on your resume.

589
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,640
It may show up in some
of the other questions

590
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,980
that you answer as well.

591
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,980
So video question one, your
introductory video question,

592
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,400
you might talk a little bit
about your experiences there.

593
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,280
It could show up in
your cover letter

594
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,240
with examples from
your experiences.

595
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,120
And so we really encourage you
to use all the spaces to share

596
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,340
whatever details you would like
to about those experiences.

597
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,120
And we're excited
to hear about them.

598
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,960
Thank you.

599
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,120
A quick question.

600
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,560
On our slide deck, we
mostly mentioned the E-score

601
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,920
and shared that
median, but someone

602
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,280
was asking if we have any
range or median for GMAT?

603
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, we don't
have one published

604
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,840
because test scores
are completely

605
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,700
optional for the
Sloan Fellows MBA.

606
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,505
We have a large number
of current students

607
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:50,880
who did not provide a test
score during their application

608
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,120
process, and so there's limited
numbers of test scores reported

609
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,900
for that.

610
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,660
Most often for
the Sloan Fellows,

611
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,280
MBA students are providing
an executive assessment score

612
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,840
if they're providing a score.

613
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,400
Again, completely optional.

614
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,960
But there's not enough data
to provide those data points.

615
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,600
Thank you.

616
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Another question from someone.

617
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,540
If they're in between
the Sloan Fellows or MBA,

618
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,120
and they're trying to decide
between which program would

619
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,520
be best for them to
apply to, what advice

620
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,960
would you give them
specifically for maybe someone

621
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,120
who has maybe nine years of
work experience right now?

622
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,260
Yeah, we definitely get
this question a lot.

623
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,780
And I can provide a
little bit of guidance,

624
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,240
but it's also requires a
little bit of reflection

625
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,280
on the applicant's
side to figure out

626
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,640
what might be best for them.

627
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,140
Between our two year MBA
and our Sloan Fellows MBA,

628
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,240
one of the biggest
differences of the programs

629
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,360
is who they're designed for.

630
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,960
So our two year MBA
students oftentimes

631
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,760
are more individual
contributors looking

632
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,320
to make a pivot in their career.

633
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,460
And so the program's
really designed.

634
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,440
You have most students
complete an internship

635
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,340
between year one and
year two to support that,

636
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,160
that change in their career.

637
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,520
For our Sloan
Fellows MBA students,

638
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,760
oftentimes they are not
individual contributors.

639
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,800
One of the things we're looking
for within our Sloan Fellows MBA

640
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,680
applicants is general
management experience.

641
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,720
And so folks that are leading
functions, leading organizations

642
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
have responsibility
for strategy or budget.

643
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,600
Those are the folks
that the Sloan Fellows

644
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,260
MBA is designed for.

645
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,840
The core is based
on the foundation

646
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,120
that every student has
general management experience.

647
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,840
And so that's one of the key
differences in the experiences

648
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,320
that students are
entering the program with.

649
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,600
The experiences that
you have in the program.

650
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,653
For Sloan Fellows MBA students,
there is no internship.

651
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,320
And so if that's
something you're really

652
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,840
looking for in a program, you
might consider the two year MBA.

653
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,400
There are still plenty of
opportunities for students

654
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,480
to make a pivot in their career
through the Sloan Fellows MBA

655
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,400
program, and so those support
resources are still there.

656
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,320
So I think it
really depends what

657
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,000
experience you're hoping
for out of the program,

658
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,460
and also what you're
hoping for in your peers.

659
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,280
Sloan Fellows MBAs have about 14
years of experience on average.

660
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,040
Our two year MBAs
have about five years

661
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,457
of experience on average.

662
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,040
And so thinking about the folks
that you'll be sitting next to

663
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,480
in your core classes, the
backgrounds of those folks,

664
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,400
if that matters to you, really
figuring out which program

665
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,000
might be best for you.

666
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,080
You are welcome to apply to both
our two year MBA and our Sloan

667
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,860
Fellows MBA.

668
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,320
If you are still
unsure or think that

669
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
both programs could
be a good fit for you.

670
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,640
But I think really thinking
about those experiences

671
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:43,823
of yourself and the peers
can help you figure out

672
00:31:43,823 --> 00:31:45,283
which might be the better fit.

673
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,300
Thank you.

674
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,720
And as a follow-up to
that, a couple of questions

675
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,200
around years of experience.

676
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,240
If you'll have a
little bit under 10,

677
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,800
if you apply by the time
you would matriculate

678
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,560
or you're not there, is the
requirement a hard requirement

679
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,760
or is there some flexibility?

680
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,860
Yeah, we do say, we are looking
for 10 years of experience.

681
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,960
I will say in the
current class, we

682
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,920
do have a couple students
who were right under 10

683
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,880
years of experience.

684
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,720
One of the things that's most
important in the experience

685
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,700
is having general
management experience.

686
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,360
So if you're at
nine and half years

687
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,480
with general
management experience,

688
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,123
certainly you could be eligible
for the Sloan Fellows program.

689
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:30,040
If you're at nine and
half years of experience

690
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,800
and don't have general
management experience,

691
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,800
we would direct you to
the two year MBA program.

692
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,300
Great.

693
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,360
Thank you for that.

694
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,720
Pivoting to an application
location question--

695
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,500
the video 1 and video 2.

696
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,120
We get a lot of
anxiety around those.

697
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,080
So folks are asking for
guidance for both of them

698
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,040
and sharing a little
more around them.

699
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,520
Yeah, these videos are--

700
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,660
I wouldn't say, make or
break for your application.

701
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,880
It's just one component of
the broader application.

702
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,560
We consider everything
as a whole package

703
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,520
and who you are
as a whole person.

704
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,740
Within the videos,
the first one,

705
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,880
it's really to get
to know you better.

706
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,760
Oftentimes students will
share more personal aspects

707
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,720
to themselves, maybe
their interests, what they

708
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,800
like to do outside of work.

709
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,758
And it's really a great
opportunity for us

710
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,800
to get to know you more
outside of what's already

711
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,360
on paper, in your resume
and your cover letter

712
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,860
and those more
professional aspects.

713
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,200
You're welcome to share
professional details

714
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,240
in the video statement,
but you can really

715
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,720
share whatever you would like
to share with the admissions

716
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,480
committee.

717
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,880
I really enjoy watching
them because it really

718
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,000
brings to life who
you are as a person

719
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,640
through that 60 second video.

720
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,600
The second video is the randomly
generated open-ended response.

721
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
And these videos are
really to just see

722
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,400
how you think on your feet, how
you communicate authentically.

723
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,640
There are no right or wrong
answers to those questions.

724
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,560
It can be nerve wracking
to have tens to prepare

725
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,840
and seconds to record, and you
just have the one chance at it.

726
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,000
But again, it's really
to just see how you think

727
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,913
and how you communicate
authentically.

728
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:12,080
It's a great way for us to
see how you might show up

729
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,520
in the Sloan classroom one day.

730
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,020
Most of the questions are
about your experiences.

731
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,639
So tell me about a time
when something happened

732
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,960
or what's your
proudest achievement.

733
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,560
There are some
additional questions

734
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,100
to see just how you think.

735
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,360
Like if you were a punctuation
mark, what one would you be.

736
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,780
And so again, no right
or wrong answers.

737
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,840
Just seeing how you
articulate your thoughts.

738
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,100
Prior to starting
the video question,

739
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,300
you will have the opportunity
to test out the software.

740
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,780
Well, you'll be required to
confirm that your video works,

741
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,260
that your audio works.

742
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,798
You'll be able to see where
the question will populate,

743
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:50,340
where it shows that
you're recording,

744
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,900
and how much time you have left.

745
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,239
So you'll get a feel for
the system before you start.

746
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,280
So just make sure you feel
comfortable with that system

747
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,200
before you click the checkbox
saying you're ready to go.

748
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,160
But again, try to
have fun with them.

749
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,520
They hopefully shouldn't
be too stressful.

750
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,440
You can approach them as you
would an interview question

751
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,475
or just a conversation.

752
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:13,600
We're really just looking
to get to know you better

753
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,840
through those two videos.

754
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,360
Thank you.

755
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,120
So another question around the
world that shaped you essay

756
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,160
question that we ask,
would you suggest or advise

757
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,800
that folks focus on earlier
years or more recent years

758
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,400
in their life experience?

759
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,040
Yeah, an applicant can
take it whichever direction

760
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,860
they would like.

761
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,800
I would say, oftentimes
we see applicants

762
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
talk about their
whole life experiences

763
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,200
and how it led them to
where they are today.

764
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,100
But you could also talk
about a more recent example.

765
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,560
It's really up to
you what you want

766
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,640
to share about your
background and how

767
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,680
the world that you're coming
from has shaped who you are.

768
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,040
So feel free to provide
newer examples or an earlier

769
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,350
one that has shaped
your life going forward.

770
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
Thank you.

771
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,080
Other than the length
of the program,

772
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,320
does the curriculum differ
between the MBA and SFMBA

773
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,600
programs?

774
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,840
Yeah, some of the core
classes, the titles

775
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,120
may be the same between the
MBA and the Sloan Fellows MBA.

776
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
The core classes
for Sloan Fellows

777
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,480
are designed with, again, the
basis that every student has

778
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,560
general management
experience, which

779
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,920
is a different level of
experience than our two year

780
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,800
MBAs.

781
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,080
And so while the
titles may be the same,

782
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,120
they are geared to those
specific student populations.

783
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,340
Once you finish
your core classes,

784
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,140
the rest of your
classes are electives.

785
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,340
Oftentimes electives are open
to students across Sloan.

786
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,720
And so you could be sitting
in class next to many two

787
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,360
year MBAs.

788
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,760
You could be sitting in class
next to masters of finance

789
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,100
or masters of business
analytics students.

790
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,560
There's a variety of folks
that you'll engage with,

791
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,120
but those core
classes are designed

792
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,320
for Sloan Fellows and then
the rest of the classes,

793
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,280
depending on which
ones you choose,

794
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,900
are designed for various
points in folks careers.

795
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:16,093
Great.

796
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:18,133
Thank you.

797
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,695
Just going through,
I know, we've

798
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,013
answered a lot of questions.

799
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,400
Some are asking is
the program full-time?

800
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,240
Is that set in stone or is
there flexibility with that?

801
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,068
Yeah, the program is
full-time, fully immersive

802
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:39,168
for the 12 months.

803
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:43,113
We do get questions like, can I
work while pursuing the degree.

804
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:44,837
The short answer is no.

805
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,960
You are spending
the large majority

806
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:50,284
of your time in classes, and
to get the full experience

807
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:53,711
of the program, engaging with
things outside of the classroom,

808
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:56,089
different extracurriculars,
and co-curriculars.

809
00:37:56,131 --> 00:37:58,011
So a large majority
of your time is

810
00:37:58,054 --> 00:38:00,294
spent focused either
on the curriculum

811
00:38:00,336 --> 00:38:02,736
or the outside the classroom.

812
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,938
So there is not time
for a full-time job

813
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:08,345
within this program, and it's
really designed for students

814
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:11,303
to take, I would say, a
pause in their careers

815
00:38:11,303 --> 00:38:14,941
to redefine their
leadership and prepare

816
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:16,681
for the next step
in their career.

817
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:18,943
And so it's really
designed for students

818
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,211
to not be working
during the program.

819
00:38:22,211 --> 00:38:23,496
Thank you.

820
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:26,098
And I think probably the last
question, because we really

821
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,336
have answered a lot,
would be-- do you have

822
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:30,491
any advice for reapplicants?

823
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:33,311
Yeah, we get this
question a lot.

824
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:38,449
And I think as you approach the
application as a reapplicant,

825
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:40,511
you probably have a
lot of questions on.

826
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:43,814
Not much might have changed
in the last six months or year

827
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,880
since you applied.

828
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:48,983
How do you really stand
out in the applicant pool?

829
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:52,425
As a reapplicant, we want to see
whatever new information or data

830
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:53,448
you have to share.

831
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:57,188
And so updating your resume
using all of the spaces

832
00:38:57,188 --> 00:39:00,005
to provide as much new
information as possible,

833
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,500
potentially asking
for a new recommender

834
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,070
to provide a new letter.

835
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,550
Or if you ask the same
recommender, still

836
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,470
having them provide a new
letter with new details.

837
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:13,292
As a reapplicant, we have
double the data on you.

838
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:16,152
We'll have your
reapplicant application

839
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,615
in addition your
initial application.

840
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:21,557
And so we'll be able to
see what those changes were

841
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,039
from your previous
application to now.

842
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,519
So really highlighting those
changes in your application

843
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:28,861
is really important.

844
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,639
You also have a
dedicated section

845
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,317
to provide a summary or
the highlights of what has

846
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:34,957
changed since you last applied.

847
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:38,552
So use all of those spaces to
provide as much new information

848
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:42,632
not as much new data
as possible for us

849
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,517
in the admissions committee.

850
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:47,597
And every year, we
have reapplicant who

851
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:48,960
are successful in admission.

852
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:52,041
And so my biggest
tip is just providing

853
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,520
as much new
information as you're

854
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:56,446
able to since we already have
your previous application

855
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,418
and all of that
information on file.

856
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:02,657
Thanks so much, Madi.

857
00:40:02,657 --> 00:40:05,677
Well, I think we've covered
most of the questions.

858
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:07,417
This is a great presentation.

859
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:07,959
Awesome.

860
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,859
Thanks, Catherine.

861
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:12,079
And thank you, everyone,
for such great questions

862
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:15,561
and staying engaged with us for
today's information session.

863
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,080
If you do have
additional questions,

864
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,481
you're welcome to
email us or attend

865
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:21,244
