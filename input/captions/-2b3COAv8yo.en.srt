1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,400
I think that researching policy

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,279
surrounding sustainability and

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,840
implementing these new technologies um

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,480
in an affordable and feasible way is the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,550
next step that will support any future

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,600
Generations after

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,400
me I'm analyzing the different policies

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,320
and incentives that New York state has

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,320
rolled out to Market participants and

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
seeing whether or not that actually can

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,000
make renewable energy storage possible

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
possible I grew up in New York and

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,160
growing up in an urban area I realized

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,320
how important environmental problems are

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,320
in urban areas in big cities and just

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,280
how energy intensive these regions are

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,000
despite so much innovation in the

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,199
technology and science surrounding

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,120
renewable energy technology what's

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,879
actually holding it back is policy so

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,760
even though these amazing new solar

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,280
panels have been developed and these

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,680
amazing new battery technologies have

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,840
been developed since they're so

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,960
expensive it's not possible to actually

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,160
Implement them and no one wants to build

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,960
a battery if it's not profitable I hope

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,200
that it can help to make New York a

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,400
model and the policies that work in New

31
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,159
York can be extrapolated for other

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,980
states other countries and hopefully

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,400
globally

00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,400
