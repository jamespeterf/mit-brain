1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,799
good morning I'm Josh Adler I'm the

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,639
founding CEO of wellsite

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,759
Navigator uh and a Sloan fellow graduate

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:14,000
class of

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,920
2013 what we do is provide a platform

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,920
for safe and efficient off-road

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,720
fieldwork

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:26,800
navigation imagine that you're driving a

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,279
4,000g fuel truck in West Texas to

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,759
deliver that fuel to a work site on a

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,079
50,000 an acre private Ranch you drive

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,440
off of the blacktop County Road through

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,239
a gate onto a maze of dirt and gravel

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,719
roads those dirt and gravel roads are

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,800
eroded they're uneven they're very

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,440
narrow for a giant fuel truck they're

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,760
pitted with mud puddles and the only

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,120
directions that you have are handwritten

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,039
notes from your dispatcher in the office

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,280
you've never been there before these

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,519
roads are not in Google Maps they're not

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,280
on any map there's no street signs

23
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,240
you're pretty much making a guesstimate

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,439
of which way you need to go you pick one

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,080
of these narrow dirt roads drive for a

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,600
few miles and you get stuck in a ditch

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,600
you climb out of the truck to figure out

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,119
why you're stuck you're inspecting the

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
truck your leg gets caught the truck

30
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:28,479
rolls over on you and you're

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,360
dead that really happened two years ago

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,840
for a contractor working for for a super

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,000
major in Texas in fact some version of

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,840
that happens every 3 days in the United

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,360
States just in Upstream oil fieldwork

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,439
not to mention all the other natural

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,520
resource Industries out there and other

38
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,240
kinds of field workor according to the

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,520
CDC vehicle incidents are the leading

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,079
cause the majority cause of Workforce

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,159
fatalities in energy work in the United

42
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,799
States over 100 per year that's a just

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,520
in oil field that is just in the United

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,560
States and what's the reason for most of

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,759
that it's because the workers in the

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,840
field don't have accurate realtime

47
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:18,080
driving directions for where they can go

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,599
safely and efficiently on authorized

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,400
routes also fieldwork Logistics are one

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,239
of the biggest wastes of money for

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,519
companies that do field work in

52
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,879
particular we found that the average

53
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,319
field worker spends about 30 minutes per

54
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,680
day lost on dirt roads it's pretty easy

55
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,080
math to find that that cost their

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,239
employers over $10,000 per worker per

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
year just in wasted labor Fuel and

58
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,080
maintenance cost and that's not to

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,920
mention the cost to the organization for

60
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,560
the loss of productivity for needless

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,120
emissions and for the risk and liability

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,440
costs associated with people getting

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,959
injured or doing damage to

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,720
property what if you could solve all

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:09,040
that by having a system that allows your

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,879
company to create the most efficient

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,080
safe and authorized routes from the

68
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,360
office or the field as realtime

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,480
navigational directions for that entire

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Workforce including the

71
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,040
contractors that's what we do wellsite

72
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,519
Navigator ensures that your field

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,080
Workforce is always safe and never

74
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,120
lost in fact we are already the most

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,920
widely installed and used software in

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,480
the US oil and gas industry with over

77
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,000
500,000 individual installations at more

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,239
than 2,000 companies since we started

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,959
doing this in

80
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,879
2012 so what we do is we enable that

81
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,200
safe and efficient fieldwork Direction

82
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,680
by allowing companies to create and

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,599
optimize custom routes locations work

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,439
sites and the individual jobs people are

85
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:03,680
supposed to do convey them as real-time

86
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,040
nav a and also at the same time gather

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,239
realtime information from the field and

88
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,239
share that throughout the workforce as a

89
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,519
central geospatial knowledge database

90
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,159
this is a bit what that's looks like

91
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,040
this is a real product being used by

92
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,000
thousands of companies

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,239
today and then you can also generate

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,800
analytics and understand who is actually

95
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,199
following the directions who isn't who

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,199
is performing effectively in their job

97
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,560
and who should be reconsidered as I

98
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,479
mentioned we're already in a very large

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,320
portion of the US oil field industry

100
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,840
today and upstream and really what we're

101
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,360
hoping to do working with I mitp

102
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,840
partners and what we're here today for

103
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,479
is um we see an opportunity to expand

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,520
Beyond oil and gas to other natural

105
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,720
resource Industries Renewables power

106
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,680
infrastructure and maintenance uh even

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,039
construction and we also are eager to

108
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,800
start meeting companies that have uh

109
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,400
operations in other countries as today

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,720
were entirely US and Canada and so

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,320
please come and talk to us out uh in the

112
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,960
hallway after the presentation today

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,280
I'll be here all day and I look forward

114
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,680
to meeting you thank you very

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,680
much thank you Josh
