1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,520
Okay. Uh so hi everyone. I'm Pablo. I'm

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,800
uh teaching Lar's lecture this week. I

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
hope we are all here to learn about

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
projection theory. And the plan for this

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
week is to talk about Bugans projection

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
theorem uh which is an extremely

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
important theorem with applications uh

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,440
in many areas of mathematics including

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,920
some pretty striking recent ones and

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,040
okay I think Larry has told you at least

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,640
a bit about it and well uh we won't be

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,280
able to do a full proof because it would

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,320
take way too long but what I'm going to

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,760
do is explain um okay so you've seen the

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
analog of this theorem in the final

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
field setting and I'm going to state it

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,760
uh to so as our starting point and then

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,680
the plan is to go through the steps in

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
the strategy in the final field setting

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,000
and see what goes wrong and what are the

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,920
ideas that one uses to overcome what

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,479
goes wrong. Okay. So recall uh how this

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,240
theorem looks like in the finite field

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,640
setting and by finite field I mean prime

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,280
prime finite field prime order because

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,439
otherwise it's not true.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,920
Okay. And the statement was hopefully

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,920
something like this. um given

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,400
t between 0 and two and s between 0 and

30
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,840
one t I want it to be neither zero nor

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,840
two because there wouldn't be anything

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,079
to say s has to be positive could be one

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,479
uh there exists

34
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,000
some epsilon that depends on these two

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,560
parameters

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,560
and is positive

37
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,399
with the following properties. If X

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,000
is in FP squared

39
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,920
and has size P to the S. So sort of S

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,640
dimension an S S dimensional set in some

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,759
sense. And D is a set of directions.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:14,560
Let's say a subset of FP and it has size

43
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:17,720
P to the T. So sort of dimension T.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,720
uh then

45
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,720
so I use the notation

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,480
pi theta of x uh to be the projection

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,280
and we can write the projection in this

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,800
way I guess just x1 plus theta x2

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,000
so from fp² to fp

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,000
then um

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,879
we can find uh sorry I missed messed up

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,879
the parameters already So the size of x

53
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,319
is between p to the zero and p^2 and t

54
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,879
is between zero and two. So this should

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,120
be t this should be s. Okay. Uh then

56
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,680
there is a large pro large between

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,400
quotes projection. Uh then the maximum

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,560
over theta in d of the size of the

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,239
projection of x is at least

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,840
p to the t / 2 plus epsilon. So we gain

61
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,599
an epsilon over t / two and t p to the t

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
over two is sort of the obvious lower

63
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,280
bound and I'm going to come back to this

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,120
obvious lower bound uh in a minute.

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
In fact uh there is a stronger version.

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,200
I think you proved this in detail and uh

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,120
you discussed the stronger version.

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
So let me state the stronger version

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
because well first of all it's important

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
in itself for applications of the final

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,640
field result. But I would say it's even

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,640
more important in the uklidian case.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
Not only we can find so at this size we

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
can find the direction so that the

75
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
projection is large the projection of

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,680
the whole set but moreover we can find

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,159
the direction so that if we project any

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,680
dense subset of x the projection is

79
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,599
still large. So if we take the maximum

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,799
over now the minimum so we look at the

81
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,400
worst possible subset which is dense. So

82
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,519
we take the minimum over subsets of X

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,239
which are dense in the sense that they

84
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,199
have relative density

85
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,199
uh P to the minus epsilon

86
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,160
and then we look at the projection of Y.

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
So we try to make the projection of a

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,240
dens set of X as small as possible but

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,240
we can't even if we have this additional

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
robustness of going looking at all

91
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,360
subsets of Y we still have a gain over T

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,360
/2.

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay. So this is Bans protection theorem

94
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,000
in the finite field setting

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
and you have proved at least this

96
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,720
version and I think discussed this

97
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
version. If anything I say is not

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,199
correct or if I say something that you

99
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,040
are not familiar with or you don't

100
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,600
understand anything please just ask.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,400
Okay. So now we want to uh Okay. So

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,960
before moving to the uklidian case uh

103
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,600
let me make this remark

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,320
on the trivial bound.

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,680
So the trivial bound is p to the t /2

106
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,360
without the just without the epsilon for

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,520
this. So this theorem is not true if uh

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,240
p is p square. If we replace P by P

109
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,919
square or anything which is not a prime

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,280
because if you look at FP square for

111
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,400
example then FP sitting there and um

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,520
if we take F to be XP and D to be FP

113
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,639
sitting in FP squared we don't escape FP

114
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,680
because FP is a sub

115
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,680
uh so this is not true

116
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,199
but without the epsilon is true in any

117
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,960
field and the argument is trivial so uh

118
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,639
okay so one should never use the word

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,639
trivial but I will use it in this case.

120
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
So everything is trivial once you've

121
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
understood it and nothing is trivial

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,960
before you've understood it but uh I

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,520
will still use the word trivial here. Um

124
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,080
so if D has at least two elements so

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,479
same setting as above so if D has more

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,880
than one element so let's allow P to the

127
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,280
S where S is positive just two elements

128
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,160
then the maximum

129
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,120
over theta in B

130
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,240
of the projection

131
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,240
of X is at least

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,000
the size of X to the 1/2. So if the size

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,560
of x is p to the u t would be at least p

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
to the t /2 and again we will see that

135
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
this doesn't use the fact that p is

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,880
prime.

137
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,479
So it's much more general. Okay. And and

138
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,520
this is trivial because just take two

139
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,120
elements. Okay. Again trivial. I will

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,960
explain it and then once you've

141
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,960
understood it you will see that you will

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,800
agree that it's trivial. Um okay so know

143
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,080
that. So just take two elements. So D

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,919
has at least two elements by so let's

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,800
just take two elements theta and theta

146
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
prime in D and then uh so the

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,639
observation that makes this trivial is

148
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,639
that uh if you map X

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,919
to the projection in direction theta

150
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,000
comma the projection in direction theta

151
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:33,479
prime. So this is small x an element of

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,479
xp squ.

153
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,919
Uh this is injective.

154
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,080
So we can recover a vector from two

155
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,720
projections

156
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,720
by linear algebra.

157
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,960
So this means that the image of X under

158
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,199
this map has size at least

159
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,400
the domain because if you have an

160
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,639
injective M map the image has the size

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,000
of the domain. Okay. So this implies

162
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,840
that the size of x is at least the size

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,599
of the projection in direction theta of

164
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,800
x times

165
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,479
the size uh of the projection in

166
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
direction of theta prime. So at least

167
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,319
one of these two has to be at least

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,639
square root of x square root of the size

169
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,319
of x.

170
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,160
Okay. Uh so this is the proof of the

171
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,599
trivial bound and I hope you will agree

172
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,080
that it's very easy and it uses

173
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,919
literally nothing. Well uh it uses that

174
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,240
this map is injected but this is a very

175
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,240
general fact

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,120
in particular this is true on any finite

177
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,080
field it doesn't have to be prime but

178
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,480
for this we need it to be prime okay so

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,279
now we want to uh have a uklidian

180
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,399
version of

181
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,080
this statement and we will see that okay

182
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,880
so maybe let's discuss the uklidian

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,519
setting so I will start with the setting

184
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,880
uh which is the way in which nucleidian

185
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,839
setting has appeared in this course

186
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,920
before but then I will rescale things uh

187
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,839
to a setting that I like better but

188
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,040
let's start uh with the following so we

189
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,880
have a parameter r which is the scale or

190
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,959
maybe one / r is the scale

191
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,480
and then we have our set x is contained

192
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,160
in the ball of radius r let's say center

193
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
at the origin or really any any ball of

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,760
radius r it doesn't make any

195
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,399
And let's suppose that X is a union

196
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,399
of unit balls

197
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,519
and D let's say in 01

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
maybe one two would be slightly more

199
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,760
natural but it doesn't really matter

200
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,760
much is a one / r separated set.

201
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
Okay, so G is a finite set of

202
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,800
directions. They are separated by the

203
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,480
scale one / R

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,720
and X is a unit of unit balls MBR. So we

205
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,640
measure X by le measure. We measure it

206
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,519
by cardinality and use bars in both

207
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,079
cases. I think this is the convention

208
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,560
you've been using in this course

209
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:22,240
and well we would like the following

210
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,320
well we would like that right. So uh

211
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,600
except that now x is not in fp square

212
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,480
but in br and d is no longer in fp but

213
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,800
in 01. So pi theta is still the same. So

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:39,600
pi theta of x1 x2

215
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,279
is x1 plus theta x2.

216
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,079
We could look at orthogonal projections

217
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,079
but up to a parameterization

218
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,399
uh is this is actually easier to work

219
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,360
with. It's not important. Okay. So we

220
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,360
can ask does the same happen?

221
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,760
So just all the bars mean different

222
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
things now. So when we project X we are

223
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,399
looking at the measure measure one

224
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
dimensional measure of the image and so

225
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,120
on. So do we have any hope of proving

226
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,040
the same theorem in this generality?

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,000
So does anyone want to guess could this

228
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,320
theorem be true in this setting? It's

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
not true because the and the balls are

230
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:24,399
closely packed into kind of a kind of a

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,440
ball radius root r. Okay, great. That's

232
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,200
a great example. But that great example

233
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
and I will come back to this still

234
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,800
satisfies the trivial bound. So can the

235
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,800
trivial bound happen in this setting as

236
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,560
written?

237
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,320
Because yeah, yeah, if you have

238
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,800
everything is is packed into a smaller

239
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,440
ball, if you project, you still have an

240
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,200
interval of size the square root. So

241
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
you're right, that fails. I'm going to

242
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,519
come back to your example. That fails,

243
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
but this still holds. Can the trivial

244
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,079
bound be true in this setting without

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,079
assuming anything else?

246
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,639
There are only two directions.

247
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay. Uh yeah, two directions. Maybe

248
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,000
it's asking too much. Let's say there

249
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,160
are Okay. What is P to the T and what is

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,639
P to the S? It would be row to the T and

251
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,120
row to the S. Uh not not row R. R to the

252
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,959
T, R to the S. Let's say there are R to

253
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,720
the S directions. Let's make it a little

254
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,560
bit more. Yeah. With two directions. Uh

255
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
maybe. Okay, let's say there are r to

256
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,600
the s directions which are 1 / r

257
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,600
separated. Can the trivial bound hold?

258
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,839
Okay, what is an example of a set that

259
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,839
has one very small projection?

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
So what is a set in the plane that has

261
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,360
one very small projection?

262
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,320
>> All of the balls in a line.

263
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
>> A line. Okay, it cannot literally be a

264
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,959
line because it's a union of balls. But

265
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,519
we put the balls in a in a long segment.

266
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:05,360
So uh so an example that should make us

267
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:09,839
kind of scared is

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,480
a 1* r rectangle. So packed with balls

269
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,920
in this way as someone suggested.

270
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Then if we project literally down we get

271
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,200
something of of size one which is much

272
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,760
much much less than square root of r.

273
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,680
But if we perturve the vertical

274
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,800
projection by r to the s the projection

275
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,279
will have size r to the s and if s is

276
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,440
less than 12 it will be less than square

277
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,800
root of r. So,

278
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
so instead of projecting in this

279
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,560
direction, if we project in a nearby

280
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,040
direction, uh this is still bad. So,

281
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,040
so if this is x

282
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,040
and

283
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,720
okay, so I think actually I chose a bad

284
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,320
so this projection cannot be written in

285
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
this way. Oh yes, it can be written in

286
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,399
this way. Just theta is zero. It can be

287
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,360
very well written in this way. Uh okay.

288
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,920
So and if theta is let's say uh minus r

289
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,720
to the s r to the s

290
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,839
then the projection of x will have size

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,800
of the order of r to the s

292
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,800
and well s could be positive but less

293
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,519
than 1/2.

294
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,519
So this this is very bad. Okay. Uh so we

295
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,199
don't want okay this is not theta this

296
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,839
is d

297
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,279
so this is very bad so we don't want d

298
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,040
to look like an interval or to be very

299
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,160
concentrated in an interval or something

300
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,240
like this so we want to avoid such such

301
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,600
a situation okay so this is bad it makes

302
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,199
even the trivial estimate hopeless

303
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,079
so maybe we'll come back to this if

304
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,240
there is time maybe not but maybe as an

305
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,959
exercise for to uh not exercise for

306
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,519
marks or anything but you can think at

307
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,279
not now now pay attention but you can

308
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
think later what goes wrong with this

309
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
argument because in R2 it's still true

310
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,600
that two projections even if the angles

311
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,639
are very close determine

312
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,360
the the original vector so why why so

313
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,440
how is this compatible so you can think

314
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,320
about this and then you will understand

315
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
many of their well not many one of one

316
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,480
of the important reasons why things are

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
much more complicated in this ukidian

318
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,199
warp.

319
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,680
Okay. So now suppose that uh we avoid

320
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,600
this in some way. Uh can we have a hope

321
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,480
of having the theorem and the answer as

322
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,040
you said is still no. So this is one

323
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,639
example we should be worried about. Uh

324
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,959
here is another example we should be

325
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,959
worried about

326
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,040
where x is essentially let's say a ball

327
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,800
of radius square root of r. It can be

328
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,680
really any radius between zero and one

329
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,360
but just two. Okay. So x should be a

330
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
union of this joint unit ball. So we

331
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,440
just pack

332
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,279
in a very dense way unit balls in a bowl

333
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,440
of radius r to the 12.

334
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,839
So the volume of X the area of X is

335
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,839
roughly R.

336
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,199
But if we project it in any direction.

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay. So we have to get rid of bad sets

338
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,519
like this. But let's get rid of bad sets

339
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,160
like this in the strongest possible way.

340
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,279
Let's suppose that G is everything.

341
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,279
So here we can so we are we are focusing

342
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,440
on what can go wrong with X. So let D be

343
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,160
absolutely everything.

344
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,079
Well, here every projection

345
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,440
is going to be a segment of length

346
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:51,920
roughly r to the 1/2.

347
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,959
So if you look at the projection of x,

348
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,040
this has size roughly square root of the

349
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,279
size of x

350
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,279
and this is for every theta.

351
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,199
So in fact if you avoid this in a

352
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,679
suitable way we recover the trivial

353
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,039
bound but it is no longer trivial. Uh

354
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,720
maybe we'll come back to this on

355
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,720
Thursday depending on how we are doing

356
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,439
with time. So the trivial bound is no

357
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,199
longer trivial even in the best case.

358
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,760
But if we want to go beyond the trivial

359
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,400
bound uh we also need to assume

360
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,400
something about x. So we need to avoid

361
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,640
this and we need to avoid this. And you

362
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,280
see that in both cases uh what's going

363
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,960
on? So the geometric

364
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,640
picture is different but in both cases D

365
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,520
is

366
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,160
an interval X is a ball. So we want to

367
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,240
avoid X D looking like an interval or X

368
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,799
looking like a box. And if we do that in

369
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,039
a suitable way then we can indeed get

370
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,620
a similar statement. So let me actually

371
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,850
state it.

372
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,850
[Applause]

373
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,679
Okay, let me say that Bugan didn't state

374
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,679
it in this way but

375
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:21,520
okay this follows from what he proved.

376
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:26,039
Okay. Um suppose that

377
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,039
same same setting as before. So,

378
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,720
so we are still assuming this

379
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,559
would have been faster to just write

380
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,320
everything down again. But okay, but we

381
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,240
need to have some assumptions uh to

382
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,120
avoid these web examples.

383
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,200
So uh okay, so first of all we need some

384
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:58,799
quantifier. So given

385
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,679
zero t uh so t is strictly between zero

386
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,480
and two and s

387
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
larger than zero there exist now two

388
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,640
parameters so I could do with one

389
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,799
parameter so you see that even here I'm

390
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,440
using epsilon for two different things

391
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,440
for the growth and for the robustness in

392
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,440
passing to subsets here I'm going to use

393
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,919
two different letters because they

394
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,760
denote different

395
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,640
thinks

396
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,679
so there exist epsilon

397
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,480
and ita both depending on s and t and

398
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,240
both positive such that the following

399
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,440
holds

400
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,799
okay so suppose that we have x union of

401
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,480
unit balls in the r

402
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,480
uh 1 / r separated set of directions

403
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,039
uh okay and then we need to assume

404
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,240
something because otherwise it's not

405
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,400
true so we need to assume that x and d

406
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
are not very concentrated in small balls

407
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,799
or small intervals. So this is what we

408
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,480
are going to assume.

409
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,760
If we intercept x with any ball of

410
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,240
radius r

411
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,240
we see only a small piece of x and the

412
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
smaller the r the smaller the piece and

413
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
the range of this little r is between

414
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,679
one and big r because x is a unit of

415
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,320
unit balls and it's a subset of the r

416
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,440
ball. Okay so this should be less or

417
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,440
equal than what? Well, on the one hand,

418
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,799
we want to compare this to the natural

419
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,600
scale, which is R. So, this tells us how

420
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,400
much smaller the reference scale is

421
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,280
compared to the global scale. And let's

422
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,679
put the T here, which is motivated by

423
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:43,360
the fact that okay uh

424
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:46,799
okay, so X has area R to the T and D has

425
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:51,720
cardinality R to the S.

426
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,720
Okay, so this T matches this T

427
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,880
and then I have the size of X. So this

428
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,520
is saying if R is much smaller than big

429
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,640
R. So if if R is big R, we have all of

430
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,799
X. So we can we cannot get any gain

431
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
because X is contained in the ball of

432
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,520
radius R. But if we are intersecting X

433
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,480
with a smaller ball,

434
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,240
we have

435
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,200
a big decay sort of power decay with

436
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,440
respect to so

437
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,000
only a very small part of X can be in a

438
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,600
small ball compared to the whole of X.

439
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,520
Okay. And it turns out that it's very

440
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,080
important for applications to have some

441
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,520
leeway here. And this leeway is given by

442
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,880
this parameter EA.

443
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,440
So this leeway says that actually

444
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,760
we don't need to assume anything if R is

445
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,080
very close little R is very close to big

446
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,679
R because if R is very close to big R

447
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
this will still be bigger than one and

448
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,000
then we have a trivial trivial

449
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,280
inequality. So this is saying the global

450
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
scales don't matter. Okay and a very

451
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,640
similar story with D.

452
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,559
If we intersect D okay balls here are

453
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,559
intervals but I'm going to

454
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,640
still the notation for balls this is at

455
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,799
most again we have our ley r to the

456
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,159
epsilon

457
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,919
and then row is between zero and one so

458
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,559
here the right thing to write is row to

459
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,159
the s

460
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,159
times

461
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,080
okay so the size of x is actually r to

462
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,559
the t but still I want to write it in

463
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,480
this way so it's clear that when we

464
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,960
intersect with the ball we are seeing

465
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,840
only a small piece of X

466
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,320
and same thing here.

467
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,799
Okay, so these are the conditions that

468
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,600
we impose to avoid these bad control

469
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,520
examples and you could say that they are

470
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,200
overkill and we are avoiding not only

471
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,880
this but okay put it in a different way

472
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
there is a whole universe between this

473
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,640
and this and yeah this is true and in

474
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
fact these conditions can be weakened

475
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,039
maybe I will make some remark about this

476
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,919
but anyway so these are the assumptions

477
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,159
then

478
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,280
there exist one direction and once there

479
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,760
is one direction there are many ctions

480
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,760
are such that we have the same uh

481
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
conclusion.

482
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,400
So if we look at the infyom

483
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,960
over all dense subsets and dense means

484
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,039
with respect to this so this parameter

485
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,720
it so it is like a tolerance parameter

486
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,919
it gives us some leeway at different

487
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,919
places to play with.

488
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,159
So y sorry yeah y is a dense subset of x

489
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,240
with this leeway r to the minus epsilon

490
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,240
then we project this subset and we get

491
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,520
the gain.

492
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,320
So the trivial now is no longer trivial

493
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,000
but sort of natural lower bound is t

494
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,000
over two and we beat it by epsilon.

495
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,600
>> Yes. Does Y also have to be a union of

496
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,799
univolves?

497
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,799
>> Uh, that's a very good question.

498
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,880
>> I don't think so. But yeah, just in

499
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,840
case. Yes. Just in case I'm too tired.

500
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,760
Yes.

501
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
Yeah. Let's say yes. Let's say yes.

502
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,799
Yeah. So, we're going to restate this in

503
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,279
a different language soon. Uh, where we

504
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,240
will get rid of balls. Yeah, let's say y

505
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,919
is also unit balls.

506
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,279
Okay, so you see that there are lots of

507
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
parameters. It's kind of a technical

508
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,240
statement. The assumption looks a bit

509
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,279
strange if you have never seen this

510
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,520
before, but nevertheless is again an

511
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,400
extremely important theorem with an

512
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,799
unbelievably range of applications and

513
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,880
we keep discovering applications and

514
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,720
something which is also important to

515
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,960
remark is that all the applications

516
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,360
really use the statement as a black box.

517
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,720
they don't okay it's sometimes people

518
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,480
also get inspired by the proof but it's

519
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,039
not a situation where the proof gets

520
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,760
used really the statement gets used so

521
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,120
it's a very very powerful statement and

522
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
I guess in the rest of the course with

523
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,159
Larry you will see some some of the ways

524
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,400
in which it is very powerful okay so how

525
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,640
does one prove this and by the way I'm

526
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,919
going to sort of as I say sketch the

527
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,440
proof skipping pretty much all details

528
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,799
but the proof I'm going to sketch is not

529
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,760
Bans proof

530
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,880
It's it's a

531
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,799
uh yeah maybe a new proof that I'm

532
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,000
writing together with Hong Wang that

533
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:44,480
takes ideas from different places. U

534
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,320
so it's is not Bhan's original proof.

535
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,240
Okay. So um the general scheme will

536
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,360
follow the steps that you've seen in the

537
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,760
final field setting but there are very

538
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,679
significant challenges. So what I'm

539
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,240
going to do is go over each of the steps

540
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,559
and explain what the challenges are and

541
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,799
what can one do to fix them and then you

542
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,799
will have to trust me that indeed they

543
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,559
they can be fixed. So I won't go into

544
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:14,880
the details. So

545
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,480
before doing so, so uh

546
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,360
you saw that if we want to go from

547
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
finite field to

548
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,960
uklidian settings,

549
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,679
uh sometimes you have to add more

550
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,159
assumptions otherwise things fail

551
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,600
because of some easy examples. But this

552
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,640
is not always the case. So there are

553
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,320
some some statements in the finite

554
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,880
setting that extend pretty in a pretty

555
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,279
straightforward way to this uklidian

556
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,760
setting. So

557
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,840
um so in order to do this uh I'm going

558
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,320
to sort of change the language a little

559
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,400
bit and

560
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,360
uh maybe rescale this. So instead of

561
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:57,039
looking at union of unions of unit balls

562
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,880
in the R ball, I'm going to look at so

563
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,840
basically I need to rescale the set down

564
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,559
by one over R. So X is going to live in

565
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,200
the unit ball and then it will be a

566
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,760
union of one over R balls and of course

567
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
you have to rescale if you rescale you

568
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,679
have to rescale everywhere else in the

569
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,440
statement. But instead of looking at the

570
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,520
volume of uh the set X, I'm going to use

571
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,039
the delta covering number. And for the

572
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,960
directions, instead of assuming that

573
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,960
they are disjoint, I'm also going to use

574
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,440
the delta covering number. So I bring

575
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,760
both. So basically X and D, I want to

576
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,559
use the same language and same scale to

577
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:37,320
make things more homogeneous.

578
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,320
So let me spend a couple of minutes

579
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,200
uh talking about the data covering

580
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:48,039
number. Suppose that X is a subset of

581
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,039
really any metric space but let's say RD

582
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,840
then uh okay so this is I guess

583
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,200
definition or notation

584
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,799
XAR delta so bar with your subscript

585
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,240
delta

586
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,760
is the smallest

587
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,760
number of delta balls

588
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,399
needed to cover

589
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,080
could be infinite but we only so in all

590
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
this business we are only looking at

591
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,399
bounded sets in which case this is

592
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,640
finite. So everything we are going to

593
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,080
see is going to be a finite number.

594
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,080
Okay. So this is a basically uh our

595
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
measuring resolution is delta. We cannot

596
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,000
distinguish anything that happens under

597
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,120
scale delta. So this is a natural way of

598
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,279
measuring the size of the set.

599
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,919
Okay. So, some just just a definition

600
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,919
but some observations.

601
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,200
Well, uh the first one I think I should

602
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,760
never use the words the word trivial but

603
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,039
I hope I'm justify justifying saying

604
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,039
that this is trivial. If x

605
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,679
is to make it really trivial two delta

606
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,679
separated

607
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,679
then the delta covering number is just

608
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,120
the cardality

609
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,600
because for each point in the set we

610
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,600
need a different ball.

611
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,679
Okay. So this will be the case for d. D

612
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,760
is delta separated but delta separated

613
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,679
to delta separated doesn't make a big

614
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,600
difference. So if the set is delta

615
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,360
separated is morally just the

616
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,520
cardinality.

617
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,520
Okay. If X is a union

618
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,760
of delta balls

619
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,200
then

620
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,159
the delta covering number is well you

621
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,919
use the balls to cover the set and okay

622
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,520
you need to normalize to pass between

623
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,480
measure and counting how many balls

624
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,480
there are. So

625
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,960
I think this should be delta to the

626
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,240
minus D. So this is the ambient

627
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,279
dimension where x lives times the le

628
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,279
measure of x.

629
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,640
Did I get this right? And it's not

630
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,640
actually equal. It's comparable.

631
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,880
>> Yes.

632
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,159
>> Or does x have to be a disjoint union of

633
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,200
delta balls?

634
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,919
>> Yeah, that's a very good question. No.

635
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,880
uh is easier to believe if it if it is a

636
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,880
disjoint union of delta balls and it is

637
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,960
also true if it's a non- disjoint unit

638
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,399
of delta balls and the reason is that if

639
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,279
you have a non- disjoint unit of delta

640
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,360
balls you can cover it by finitely

641
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,200
overlapping okay if the if you have a

642
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,799
disjoint unit of delta balls I hope this

643
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,399
is clear because the best way to cover

644
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,000
it by using those those balls

645
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,640
if you have a finitely overlapping

646
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,399
collection of delta balls then well you

647
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,840
just cover by the finally overlapping

648
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,440
family and you lose and any any union of

649
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,279
balls you can cover by a finite

650
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,360
overlapping. So I guess you need some

651
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,200
covering theorem to make it precise.

652
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,640
Anyway, it's true and we are not going

653
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,360
to use it. But you can convince yourself

654
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,760
that it's true. Again, easier to believe

655
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,919
if the balls are disjoint, but also

656
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,120
true. If balls are disjoint is equal if

657
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,360
the PS are not disjoint, there is a

658
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,880
wiggle. In fact, the wiggle I guess that

659
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,840
maybe depends on the ambient dimension

660
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,000
D.

661
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
Okay. So I'm just making these remarks

662
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,080
to say that to to sort of explain how

663
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,520
this relates to our previous setting

664
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,200
because now from now on we are going to

665
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,200
measure everything by the delta covering

666
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,559
number and the point I want to make is

667
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,399
that this recovers the volume and the

668
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,600
cardality when the sets are delta

669
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,600
separated or unit of delta balls.

670
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,720
Okay. So another way of thinking about

671
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,360
the delta covering number is as a box

672
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:53,519
counting number. So let d delta

673
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,519
uh be the covering of our d by delta

674
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,240
cubes.

675
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,880
So

676
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,840
so this is delta k

677
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,840
plus z delta

678
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,000
maybe let's make it half open so that

679
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,440
this is a partition to the d

680
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,720
where k is in z to the d.

681
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,480
So I'm I'm just doing like a diadic

682
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,279
covering. Delta doesn't have to be

683
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:28,480
diatic, but I'm So this is this is a

684
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:31,519
how do you say the tiling of RD by cubes

685
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,200
of size delta.

686
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,720
I make them half open so they are

687
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,640
disjoint but it's not really important.

688
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,600
Okay. So uh

689
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,600
the delta covering number

690
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,559
is up to a multibility constant the

691
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,919
number of cubes in the delta that are

692
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,760
hit by the set.

693
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,720
So the cardinality

694
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,559
of the cubes in the delta

695
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,399
which intersect the set.

696
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,559
So this is why this is called box

697
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,559
counting number as well.

698
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,440
Okay, why is this true is because if you

699
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,559
cover by cubes in an efficient way, so

700
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,720
if you know how many cubes you're

701
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,159
hitting, well, you can cover each cube

702
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,880
by a a finite number of balls of radius

703
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,360
delta.

704
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,039
Again, this wiggle may depend on D. So D

705
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,600
is a fixed parameter. It will be one or

706
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,279
two for Bansuction theorem. So I

707
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,760
consider it as a constant. So you can

708
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,000
cover each each of these cubes by a

709
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,519
finite number of delta balls and vice

710
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,960
versa. If you have a delta ball, you can

711
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:49,600
cover it by a finite number of cubes.

712
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,039
So that's that's the proof proof by

713
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,679
picture. Okay. And one nice consequence

714
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,799
of this is that this allows us to snap

715
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,080
any set to a grid and then this allows

716
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,799
us to apply uc non- ucleian uh integer

717
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:10,120
results discrete results. So

718
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,120
let's define

719
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:18,159
so what is x supperscript bracket delta

720
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,599
is the set that is obtained by snapping

721
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,560
points to the grid. So if uh x

722
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,919
intersects this this cube then this

723
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,159
point will be an ex in x delta.

724
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,159
In this way I I snap it to the latis.

725
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:40,240
Okay. Formally this is all the case

726
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:44,760
such that the cube delta k plus 0 delta

727
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,760
to the d intersects x.

728
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,240
Okay. So anytime there we see something

729
00:34:52,639 --> 00:35:00,440
here we look at this point. Okay. And

730
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,440
then uh because of this

731
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,760
the delta covering number is roughly up

732
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,599
to a multiplicative constant the same as

733
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,599
the cardinality. This is now a finite

734
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,160
set and it's a finite set in a latis. So

735
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,320
it's just the not just not just a latis

736
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,560
it's just the integer latis scaled down

737
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,480
by delta but it's just the integer

738
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,520
latis.

739
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay. And by using this uh one can

740
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:33,480
extend many results that are true um in

741
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,480
ZD to delta covering numbers.

742
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:40,920
[Applause]

743
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,920
So using this

744
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,079
in particular the following three things

745
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,160
which are three very important tools in

746
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,240
the proof of the finite field case of

747
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,280
bans projection theorem and also in the

748
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,280
uklidian case uh the rua triangle

749
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
inequality

750
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,359
the punic rou are

751
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
inequalities

752
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,920
and the valuic theorem.

753
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,920
They all hold for delta covering numbers

754
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,880
by putting bar delt. So when you see bar

755
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,520
you put delta. Okay. And you lose

756
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,520
multiligative constants because of this.

757
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,359
So where you have equality you no longer

758
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,359
have equality. But this is very

759
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,359
harmless.

760
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,040
Okay. For example, I'm going to state

761
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
the RA triangle inequality as a model

762
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,640
and then you can imagine how the other

763
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,839
two behave.

764
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,440
Um, so we have okay so we have three

765
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,079
sets

766
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,680
in the same RD.

767
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
Let's say bounded to make sure that the

768
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,920
delta governing number is finite. Then

769
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,200
let's see if I get this right. If not,

770
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,160
you just let me know. Okay. in in the

771
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,920
original. So in the discrete triangular

772
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,079
inequality here we have inequality here

773
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,200
we have inequality up to a constant. So

774
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,200
this is the only thing we have to

775
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
change.

776
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,359
Okay. Did I get this right? Is this the

777
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,880
correct statement? Okay. So this is an

778
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,040
example. Just put delta delta delta

779
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,960
delta and take equality by equality up

780
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,960
to a constant. And how do you prove

781
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,960
this? Well, you

782
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,320
you snap it to the grid. You have to be

783
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,079
a very like a little bit careful because

784
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
you can snap A to the grid. You can snap

785
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,480
B to the grid and then you can take A

786
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,079
minus B for the snapped versions and

787
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,480
that's not going to be exactly the same

788
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,920
as snapping A minus B to the grid. So

789
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,680
there is something that doesn't exactly

790
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,640
commute

791
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,920
but it almost commutes. So almost

792
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,920
commutes. So I'm not going to another

793
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,880
exercise is for you to convince yourself

794
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,240
that this is true. So okay. So you see

795
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,560
that for the projection theorem

796
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,920
we really need to impose assumptions if

797
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,680
we wanted to hold in the nuclean

798
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
setting. But this is not always true.

799
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,839
Here we have three very important tools

800
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:47,240
and they basically work in the same way.

801
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,240
Okay. So now we can start going over

802
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,640
the steps in the proof of the theorem in

803
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,599
the final field setting and seeing what

804
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,240
the obstacles are and what one can do to

805
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,400
overcome the obstacles if one wants to

806
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:08,680
follow the same scheme of proof in the

807
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,680
uklidian setting. Any questions so far?

808
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:17,480
[Applause]

809
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,480
Okay. So in the finite field setting

810
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,960
what was the first step in the proof? It

811
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,320
was to prove expansion

812
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,839
using a polomial for just one set. So

813
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,680
let's recall what uh this was. So if we

814
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:42,280
have a and fp okay I guess let's state

815
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,280
the quantifiers first. So given s

816
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,560
01 there exists an epsilon

817
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,960
such that the following holds uh if

818
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,520
we have a subset of our of our prime

819
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,280
field so here it has to be a prime field

820
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,400
this already fails if it's not the prime

821
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,240
field and well I'm going to come back to

822
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,520
this point several times okay and

823
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:11,520
suppose that it has size p to the s

824
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,480
then uh There exist a polomial

825
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,720
actually uh

826
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,599
there exist a polomial which is fixed

827
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,680
for all s for all epsilon and for all a

828
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,040
and it can be x1 x2 x3 - x4 x5 x6 so

829
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,000
that polinomial works but it doesn't

830
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,480
really matter which polinomial it is so

831
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,119
let's call it q

832
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,119
okay and

833
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,119
if we apply q to a we get expansion

834
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,359
Okay. So I think what you did with Larry

835
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,119
gave the following polinomial.

836
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,440
I think it was clear from what you did

837
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,119
with Larry that really doesn't matter

838
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,000
which polinomial it is as long as you

839
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,400
have some polomial because at the later

840
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,079
stage one is going to apply pura to

841
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,079
bring down the polomial to the simplest

842
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,319
possible polomial.

843
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,440
Uh so that was a later step at this step

844
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,359
any polomial works.

845
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,839
Okay so this one works but it's not too

846
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,200
important which one it is. Okay how how

847
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,640
did you prove this? So we can see to

848
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,960
what extent things go wrong in the

849
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,680
in the uklidian setting and to what

850
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,560
extent we can recycle some of the ideas.

851
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,560
So idea of proof

852
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,319
if I claim that you saw something with

853
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,119
Larry and you didn't please let me know.

854
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,960
Uh he told me and showed me notes but I

855
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,800
could still be wrong about something.

856
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,280
Okay. What was the idea of proof behind

857
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:52,400
this? Uh so one looks at

858
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:57,440
maybe let's call it x a minus a over a

859
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,920
minus a and here uh we skip zero we

860
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,960
don't want to divide by zero and then

861
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,960
there are two possibilities either x is

862
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,960
everything

863
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,480
and then

864
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,680
one can conclude in some way I'm not

865
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,599
this is not I'm not going to recall how

866
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,480
to do it and the other possibible ility

867
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,880
is that X is not everything.

868
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,200
And if it's not everything,

869
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:30,359
there exists some uh little X in X

870
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,359
such that X + one is not in X

871
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,000
because it's not everything and then one

872
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,119
can also conclude. So in both case this

873
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,200
one has to work. I'm not saying it's

874
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,079
trivial, but this was the structure of

875
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,960
the proof. And this extremely innocent

876
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:50,400
step is what distinguishes

877
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,079
FP from FP square. If we were working in

878
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,800
FP square, we would not be able to do

879
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,560
this because FP square

880
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,040
has a

881
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,079
subgroup which is FP. So you cannot

882
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,560
escape FP by adding one.

883
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:10,560
So this extremely innocent adding plus

884
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,560
one uh distinguishes okay so

885
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,560
distinguishes

886
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:25,200
FP and FP square let's say

887
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,400
okay so

888
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:33,599
we want to do something similar

889
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,839
and so let's say uh we have an A.

890
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,280
Well, first of all,

891
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,119
it's very likely that we will need to

892
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,319
assume something about A. In fact, we

893
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,400
need to assume something about A in the

894
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,000
UK setting because if A is a is a

895
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,920
segment,

896
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,520
it does like any polinomial check, it

897
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:53,680
doesn't grow. So, if X is

898
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,319
1 1 + R 1 1 +

899
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,240
delta to the

900
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,560
1 - t something like this, just just a

901
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,000
small small segment. If you add it to

902
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,520
itself, multiply by itself, you get

903
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
slightly longer segments. There is no

904
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,040
real growth is exactly the same issue uh

905
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,800
as we had when we were projecting uh an

906
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,960
X which was too concentrated in a large

907
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,119
ball. Okay, but now we sort of know how

908
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,160
to get rid of that. We need to assume

909
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,960
that A is not too concentrated inside

910
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,280
any segment. Okay, but even assuming

911
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,040
that we do that, uh we see that we have

912
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,040
lots of problems if we try to do

913
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,720
something like this.

914
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,319
What are the problems? So can you tell

915
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,319
me some problems? Why? So some

916
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,560
challenges in

917
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,400
trying to do something like this. If now

918
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,119
a is a subset of let's say 01 or one two

919
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,560
let's say 01 it doesn't matter.

920
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,640
So what things you should be worried

921
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,200
about?

922
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,599
Yes.

923
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,680
>> Uh x could be unbounded.

924
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,319
>> X could be unbounded. Yes. So a so in

925
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,200
the final field we need to avoid zero in

926
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,720
the denominator but in the ukidian case

927
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,920
we don't only need to assume zero. We

928
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,760
should be very worried about small

929
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,200
denominators not just zero but small

930
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,720
denominators because this is going to

931
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,400
blow up and yeah this is certainly an

932
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,079
issue.

933
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,319
Are there any other issues one should

934
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,319
worry about?

935
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,839
What does it mean to equal FP?

936
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,760
>> That's right. Well, I mean, okay. Yeah,

937
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,640
that's Yeah, what does it mean to equal

938
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,560
FP is not clear. And I would say what is

939
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,119
even much less clear is what does it

940
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,119
mean to add one

941
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,359
because

942
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,920
I don't know R is certainly not I mean R

943
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,920
is invariant and they're adding one and

944
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,560
it's not I mean this doesn't live in 01

945
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,720
anymore. If we force it to live in 01 by

946
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,079
intersecting with 01, there could still

947
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,160
be something. I mean, if we add one, we

948
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,040
could still land here. So adding one

949
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,560
doesn't seem like a good idea. And from

950
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,960
a conceptual point of view, there is

951
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,520
something that is even more worrying,

952
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,640
which is here it is crucial that FP

953
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,920
doesn't have any sub additive subgroup.

954
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,800
So it's a simple group. It doesn't have

955
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:15,240
any non-trivial subgroups because if it

956
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,240
had a subgroup, this wouldn't be true.

957
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,520
Now does R have any subfields or

958
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,599
subgroups

959
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,599
or sub rings?

960
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,640
Well, first of all, it does have

961
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,040
subgroups, additive subgroups.

962
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,440
It does

963
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,520
of any dimension. Okay, so of course it

964
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,599
does. All of our rational numbers,

965
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,520
number fields, but okay, number fields

966
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,839
are countable. So we are interested in

967
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,960
larger things, but it does have

968
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:48,319
subgroups of intermediate size. It does

969
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,240
not have sub rings of intermediate size.

970
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,760
But this is a difficult theorem and in

971
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,119
fact it's a consequence of bhans

972
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,160
protection theorem. So we cannot really

973
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,040
use it. So here we are escaping because

974
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:03,119
x is not a sub ring. But it's not so

975
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:06,880
clear if there is a subring type

976
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,520
structure here in R. Okay. All of these

977
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,440
things should make it very scary and a

978
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:16,240
normal person would give up at this

979
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,800
stage. uh but there is a paper by Larry

980
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,000
Guth and uh George Zal my colleague at

981
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,640
UBC and Netscats where they managed to

982
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,400
extend this idea to the uklidian setting

983
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,680
not to prove transportation theorem to

984
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,000
prove some different related theorem. So

985
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,720
let me tell you what they did to

986
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,760
overcome

987
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,520
these obstacles. uh but first of all uh

988
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,040
I should define something that I should

989
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,040
have defined before.

990
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,079
So we have these non-conentration

991
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,000
conditions. So we call this

992
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,520
non-conentration conditions because it

993
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,800
tells us that X and D are not

994
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,400
concentrated in both. So

995
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,520
non-conentration conditions. So looking

996
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,200
at this uh we are going to write a

997
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,839
definition

998
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,319
which is inspired by this so that we

999
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:08,599
don't have to repeat these sort of

1000
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,599
conditions every time.

1001
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,359
By the way, even in in in the final

1002
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,359
field setting, uh what Bangatan Tower

1003
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:35,920
did was also not this. So this this idea

1004
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:39,839
came later. Uh so it's originated from

1005
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,440
GV which is after Bangkawo proved

1006
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,760
something like this. So Bangas did

1007
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,520
something much much more complicated.

1008
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,520
Okay. Um definition

1009
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:57,359
the subset of the unit ball in RD.

1010
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,480
We just want to fix some region of

1011
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:05,119
space. So why not fix the unit ball uh

1012
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:08,720
is a and okay let delta be uh between

1013
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,800
zero and one not zero and maybe also not

1014
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:15,040
one. Uh so we say that this is a delta.

1015
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,839
Okay. And then we have a parameter t

1016
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,119
which is between zero and d. And then we

1017
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,599
have a constant which is positive.

1018
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:29,040
Let's say at least one. Okay. So we say

1019
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:30,800
that x is a delta s c d. So this d tells

1020
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,559
us the ambient dimension. And I will

1021
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,280
probably forget to write it down or it

1022
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:40,079
will be clear from context. Set

1023
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,880
if the following holds

1024
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,800
if we interet x. So note I'm not

1025
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,559
assuming X is a union of all. I'm not

1026
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,400
assuming X is delta separated. I'm not

1027
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,839
assuming anything and I'm not assuming

1028
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,240
anything because I'm using to use the

1029
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,680
delta covering number to measure things.

1030
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,760
So this is nothing about the delta

1031
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,520
covering number. You don't need to

1032
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,839
assume anything as long as you remember

1033
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:05,440
to write the bar delta. Okay. So uh if I

1034
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:07,359
intersect X with a ball

1035
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,040
and measure it by the delta covering

1036
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:14,720
number, this is at most C. So C is the

1037
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,960
tolerance the leeway that I have times R

1038
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,599
to the S. So S measures the degree of

1039
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,359
concentration of non concentration the

1040
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,440
degree of non concentration. So the

1041
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,119
larger the S, so R is going to be

1042
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,520
between zero and one or between delta

1043
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,760
and one. So the larger S, the smaller

1044
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:36,559
this is and the stronger this condition

1045
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:38,880
becomes times the size of X.

1046
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,440
So again this says that a ball cannot

1047
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,480
contain too much of x and this is for

1048
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,000
every well but for every center and for

1049
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,359
every

1050
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,440
radius between delta and one.

1051
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:56,400
Yes s

1052
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,319
>> sorry. Yes.

1053
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,000
Well it could be s or t but one has to

1054
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,000
fix one. Yeah. S. Thank you.

1055
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,920
Okay. So I hope you agree that in the

1056
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,760
statement of regress projection theorem

1057
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:15,599
this is the condition we have on X and

1058
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:18,880
on D. On X we had a T and on G we had an

1059
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,640
S. But this is the condition that we had

1060
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,960
and so we can bring them both under the

1061
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,960
same umbrella using the delta covering

1062
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,960
number.

1063
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,680
Okay. This is saying X is not too

1064
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,280
concentrated inside small balls and the

1065
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,680
strength of the concentration is given

1066
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,280
by S and there is a tolerance given by

1067
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,559
C. C could depend on delta. So C is

1068
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,720
anything in particular it could depend

1069
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,040
on delta and in the statement of BAN

1070
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,880
projection theorem. So in ban projection

1071
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,680
theorem this in fact is going to be

1072
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,480
delta to the minus EA. So you have a

1073
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,480
leeway that increases as a power with

1074
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,119
delta very small power but nevertheless

1075
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,800
a power. Okay. Uh so now we can state uh

1076
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,119
something

1077
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,119
I don't know

1078
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,119
uh

1079
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,000
lema. So it is the analog of the first

1080
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,000
step in the proof. So it's the analog of

1081
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
this

1082
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,599
Given an s between zero and one

1083
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,000
there exists an epsilon

1084
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,480
and all these epsilons can be taken to

1085
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,760
depend continue they depend continuously

1086
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:41,920
on s. So this is important in the so

1087
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,319
okay uh well I started saying the

1088
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,559
sentence I'm going to finish. So in the

1089
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:50,480
final setting one does this and then

1090
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,720
what is the next step? one iterates this

1091
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,920
and then one keeps growing. In order to

1092
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,920
know that you keep growing, you need to

1093
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,079
know that this epsilon

1094
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,839
remains bounded away from zero as long

1095
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,119
as the exponent remains bounded away

1096
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,720
from one. Okay, so the same is going to

1097
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,280
be true here although as we will see

1098
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:11,599
next time I think next time uh it's much

1099
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,440
more much much more complicated to

1100
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,559
iterate in this case but okay let's

1101
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,280
focus on this uh for today. Okay, given

1102
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,480
S there is an epsilon

1103
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:29,040
such that the following holds.

1104
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:32,160
Suppose A is in 01.

1105
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,160
The delta covering number is delta to

1106
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,520
the minus s

1107
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:40,000
and a is a

1108
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,079
delta

1109
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,760
s

1110
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,760
delta to the epsilon minus epsilon set.

1111
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,760
So it's is very nonconentrated because s

1112
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,599
matches the size. But on the other hand

1113
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,640
there is quite a bit of leeway in this

1114
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,559
delta to the minus epsilon.

1115
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,839
Then

1116
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,839
oh okay so there exist a polomial

1117
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,440
Q

1118
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,680
it could be the same Q. So that that Q

1119
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,680
if you want

1120
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,800
any polomial so really it doesn't matter

1121
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,720
because you can always apply polic but

1122
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,240
let's say that polinomial but any

1123
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,240
polinomial will do then

1124
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,280
we have we have growth I'm just putting

1125
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,359
delta governing number everywhere and we

1126
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,400
get growth

1127
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:40,319
so we get minus delta minus s which was

1128
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,400
the size of a but

1129
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,720
We get a delta to the minus epsilon grow

1130
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,720
over that.

1131
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:01,200
Okay. So it looks very very similar uh

1132
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:03,839
to that to what to this except that we

1133
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,400
need to add this non concentration

1134
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:08,319
assumption. We certainly need to add

1135
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,119
something because otherwise if a is just

1136
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:14,079
an interval is not true. It's not clear

1137
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,960
between interval and this what happens

1138
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,440
but okay with this assumption it is

1139
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,240
true.

1140
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,160
Okay. So how can one prove that? Uh so

1141
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,240
we want to use this strategy but we saw

1142
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,680
that there are many problems. So I'm not

1143
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,599
going to do the whole proof, but I'm

1144
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,599
going to tell you how to solve

1145
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,359
okay two of the problems or to some

1146
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,599
degree I will tell you how to solve two

1147
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,599
of the problems.

1148
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,000
Okay, one is really cheating but okay so

1149
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,880
I guess what I'm going to tell you is

1150
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,160
that cheating doesn't always work but it

1151
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,559
does work in this case in this

1152
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,559
particular case.

1153
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:18,720
I should finish at 225. Is that right?

1154
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,599
Okay. Plenty of time.

1155
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:25,160
Okay. So, idea of proof. I'm not going

1156
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,160
to prove it but

1157
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:35,119
okay. So

1158
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,520
uh with in the final field setting this

1159
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,760
works here we have the problem that uh

1160
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,960
the denominators can be very small and

1161
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,160
then this could be huge. So well we are

1162
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,280
going to do two things at twice to try

1163
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,799
to at least uh reduce the issue. So

1164
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,799
we're going to define b in the following

1165
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,799
way.

1166
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,760
It is essentially a over a a minus a

1167
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:03,359
over a minus a.

1168
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,280
Okay. So we pick some gamma and the

1169
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,760
gamma in the proof has to be picked

1170
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,160
carefully so that things work out and

1171
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,920
I'm going to go into the proof but you

1172
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,880
we have to pretend that there is a gamma

1173
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,680
so that will work. Okay. So first of all

1174
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:22,240
I restrict the denominators

1175
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:24,720
to being larger than delta 2 the gamma.

1176
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,520
So in this way

1177
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:30,000
well I got rid of the worst possible

1178
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,680
case where the expansion is too much.

1179
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,839
But even then this could escape the

1180
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:37,400
interval 01 and I don't want to escape

1181
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,400
the interval 01.

1182
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,599
So I intersect it with the interval 01.

1183
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,359
So this B is going to play the role of

1184
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:50,960
X.

1185
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,760
And by doing this I'm avoiding again I'm

1186
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,960
avoiding two related but not exactly the

1187
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,200
same issues. One is that this could

1188
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,880
escape our sort of reference interval

1189
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,640
and the other is that the denominators

1190
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,440
could be too small. They can still be

1191
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,720
quite small because so gamma is not

1192
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,440
zero. So this can still be small but

1193
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,280
so there is a trade-off.

1194
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,280
If we allow too small denominator things

1195
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,880
blow up too much but we still have to

1196
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,200
allow small denominators otherwise we

1197
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,720
are missing too much of a minus a over a

1198
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:23,280
minus a. So this gamma is gives us the

1199
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,240
tradeoff.

1200
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,480
Okay so that's one thing we do uh but

1201
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,160
the most important thing to understand

1202
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,000
is

1203
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,599
what do we do instead of this? So really

1204
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,640
adding one doesn't really make sense in

1205
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,799
this setting. So what do we do? And here

1206
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,119
comes a very easy but absolutely

1207
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,839
critical lema.

1208
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,319
So in the same way that

1209
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,799
the method in FP doesn't work in FP

1210
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,720
squared

1211
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:53,599
what works in R. Okay, this is a remark

1212
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,799
I should have made earlier but uh I

1213
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,640
don't think we have the statement

1214
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,920
anymore. Yeah, we don't have the

1215
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,160
statement of bug prediction theorem

1216
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,839
anymore. But bug prediction theorem is

1217
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,480
not true over C because over C you could

1218
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:09,760
you could take X to be essentially R

1219
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:13,440
squared living in C square and you could

1220
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,680
take D to be a piece of R living in C

1221
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,400
and because R is a subring of C you

1222
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,240
don't escape. So there is no growth. So

1223
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,079
it's exactly the same reason why it

1224
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,400
doesn't work in FP square because FP

1225
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,160
square has an intermediate algebraic

1226
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,920
structure. C has an intermediate

1227
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,559
algebraic structure which is R and

1228
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,079
because of this it doesn't work

1229
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,319
and

1230
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,240
here we use that FP doesn't have an

1231
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:38,880
intermediate algebraic structure. So

1232
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,799
actually this lema is very crucial in

1233
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,680
the sense that it is what distinguishes

1234
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:50,319
R from C or for many or okay from many

1235
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:52,000
other things but in particular from C.

1236
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,680
Okay.

1237
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,400
So there are many ways in which R is

1238
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:00,319
different from C and we will see that it

1239
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,720
is the order structure uh what

1240
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,160
distinguishes R from C in the lema in

1241
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,440
the proof of dilemma. Actually dilemma

1242
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,359
can be proved in many ways and some of

1243
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,880
them do not use the order structure but

1244
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,599
in my proof I will use the order

1245
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,000
structure. Okay. So here is the lema. Uh

1246
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,520
suppose that B

1247
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,359
eventually we are going to apply to this

1248
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:21,280
B that's why I call it B. But a priority

1249
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:24,319
is any B it's contained in 01 and

1250
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:28,240
suppose that zero is in B zero is in

1251
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:31,440
this B because A1 could be equal to A2

1252
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:34,240
okay and then uh

1253
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:38,040
let row

1254
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,040
be the largest gap

1255
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,839
in B.

1256
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,599
Okay, what is the largest gap? So a gap

1257
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,119
is a

1258
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,760
is a connected component of the

1259
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,240
complement. So we are in R. So connected

1260
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,760
components are segments.

1261
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,319
So the complement is a union of

1262
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,079
segments. Well could be points. I mean B

1263
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,599
could be dense but let's imagine B is

1264
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,559
closed. I think it doesn't have to be

1265
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,040
closed. Maybe let's say closed.

1266
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,960
It's not really important.

1267
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,000
Okay. If it's closed and the complement

1268
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,280
is a finite or contraable union of open

1269
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,799
intervals. Each of them has a length and

1270
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,359
we take the supreum maybe

1271
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:23,760
okay everything is going to be fi like

1272
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,680
finiteary because in our application but

1273
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,240
let's say the largest in the sense of

1274
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,079
the supreum of the length of the gaps in

1275
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,599
B so is it clear what this is we just

1276
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:36,599
look at the complimentary intervals and

1277
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,599
we look at the largest one then

1278
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,119
there exist B in B

1279
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,119
such that either

1280
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:52,000
The distance from B / 2 to B is at least

1281
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,319
row over four

1282
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,559
or

1283
01:01:54,319 --> 01:02:04,920
the distance from B + 1 / two

1284
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,920
to B is at least row over 4.

1285
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:21,040
Okay. So proof,

1286
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:23,040
let B prime be B / 2 union B + 1 / two.

1287
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,760
And this means what you expect it to

1288
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,680
mean. So you take little B in B divided

1289
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,640
by two and you do that for every little

1290
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,960
B in B. And then you take little B plus

1291
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,599
one over two for every little B in B. So

1292
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,720
I hope it's clear what this is.

1293
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,640
Okay. So this is contained in 01 as well

1294
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,119
because B is contained in 01. So this is

1295
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,400
contained in 0 1/2. This is contained in

1296
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,839
one half one.

1297
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,359
So we have zero, we have one, we have

1298
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:54,680
1/2 and 1/2 is in B prime because zero

1299
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,680
is in B.

1300
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,280
You will see that this is important. So

1301
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:09,680
zero is in B. So one half is in B prime.

1302
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:11,760
Now what is the largest gap in B prime?

1303
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,760
So by definition the largest gap in B is

1304
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,119
row. So that's the definition of row. So

1305
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:19,599
what is the largest gap in B prime?

1306
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,599
>> Row over two.

1307
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,200
Here the largest gap is row over two

1308
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,200
because I'm scaling down by a factor of

1309
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,640
two. And here the largest gap is row

1310
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,640
over two because I'm translating and

1311
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,319
scaling down by Yes.

1312
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,799
>> Could actually there be a gap of size

1313
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:35,760
row if B has a big gap at the ends of

1314
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:40,079
the intervals?

1315
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:42,319
Okay. So I guess uh

1316
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,319
maybe let's assume that one is also in B

1317
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:46,559
or something like this. So I mean there

1318
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,240
could be an infinite gap.

1319
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,160
Is is that what you're worried about?

1320
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:55,280
>> That yeah there's a gap from like one

1321
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,440
minus row to one or something. But if

1322
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,440
one is in in B then uh

1323
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,520
>> let's say zero and one are in B. So one

1324
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,240
is also here because you could take A3

1325
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:06,880
and A4 to be A1 and A2.

1326
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,880
So one is in B.

1327
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,400
Uh if you define the gap in a way that

1328
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,200
avoids this issue, you don't need one to

1329
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,799
be in B. But let's it's not important.

1330
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,200
Okay. Why is it important that one half

1331
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:19,280
is in B? Because here the largest gap is

1332
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,359
has size row over two. Here the largest

1333
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,079
gap has size row over two. But if one

1334
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:26,319
half wasn't here, there they could be

1335
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,480
combined to form a larger gap going

1336
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:31,839
across. But it cannot go across because

1337
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,839
there is one half is there. Okay. So now

1338
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,839
um

1339
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,280
now let's draw the largest gap or the

1340
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,240
gap that approximates the largest gap.

1341
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,240
So this one has size let's say row minus

1342
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,240
epsilon

1343
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,200
and okay so this is the center of the

1344
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:58,640
gap. So this is the gap in B not in B

1345
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:01,520
prime in B. And now let's write let's

1346
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:04,880
draw

1347
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:08,200
an interval in the middle of length row

1348
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,200
over two.

1349
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,319
Maybe a closed interval.

1350
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,520
This closed interval contains an element

1351
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:19,520
of B prime because the largest gap of B

1352
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,280
prime is row over two. That means that

1353
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,680
any interval of length row over two

1354
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,359
contains a point in B prime. Okay. So

1355
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,359
maybe let's write this down. So largest

1356
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,359
gap.

1357
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,839
So this interval contains a point in B

1358
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,160
prime.

1359
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,119
But this point is a distance at least

1360
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:47,760
row over four from B

1361
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,520
because this gap is double the size. So

1362
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,880
even if the point was at one of the end

1363
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,799
points, so the point could be here. But

1364
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,720
even if it was at one of the end points,

1365
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:57,720
this is row over four. This is row over

1366
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,720
four.

1367
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,799
Okay. So maybe let's do a larger

1368
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:09,720
picture. So this is row minus epsilon

1369
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:09,720
gap in b.

1370
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:14,039
Okay. And this is a row interval.

1371
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,839
So it contains

1372
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,599
some point in b prime because the

1373
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,280
largest gap in b prime is row. And this

1374
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,799
interval has length row. So it cannot be

1375
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,599
completely empty otherwise it would be a

1376
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:32,400
larger gap. Okay. Whichever point is in

1377
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:36,079
this interval is at large distance from

1378
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:38,240
B because there is nothing in B here.

1379
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,559
So that's the proof. So you do the

1380
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,079
calculation is at least row over four.

1381
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,559
Uh

1382
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,880
maybe row over five because you need to

1383
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:49,680
take into account this epsilon. Maybe

1384
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,480
row over five just in case

1385
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,480
it's not it's not important.

1386
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,839
So you see that this is a simple

1387
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,039
geometric argument but it very very

1388
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:02,880
strongly uses the order structure of R.

1389
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,480
So this argument doesn't work in C

1390
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,240
because there is no order and in fact it

1391
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,760
cannot work because what we are going to

1392
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:13,559
prove using this is not true over C.

1393
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,559
Any questions about this?

1394
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:21,119
Okay you can prove this lema in other

1395
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,960
ways. So Guat and Zal in their paper I

1396
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,760
think they don't do this proof but I

1397
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,240
think this proof is easier and shows how

1398
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,880
the order structure is fundamental.

1399
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,880
Okay. So

1400
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,640
hopefully I have proved the lema.

1401
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:38,079
Okay. So of course a point in B prime

1402
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,280
has either this form or this form

1403
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,480
because that's the definition of B

1404
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,359
prime. Okay. So here we have a B prime

1405
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,119
in B prime which is far from B. that B

1406
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,440
prime is either this or this because

1407
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,640
that's the definition of B prime. So

1408
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:56,359
that's how one concludes the proof.

1409
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,359
Any questions again?

1410
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:04,000
Okay. So

1411
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:08,559
now what the idea is to use B over two

1412
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:11,520
or B+ over two instead of

1413
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:14,480
B+ one.

1414
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:18,640
So why does B+1 work? So what is

1415
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:22,480
important about b+ or x + one? So what

1416
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,960
is important is that

1417
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:28,640
again it's a polomial in this case is a

1418
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,400
linear polomial but

1419
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:34,560
that that takes something in x and lands

1420
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:38,920
it not in x. Well the same is true for b

1421
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,920
over two and b plus one over two.

1422
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,759
you take something in B and it lands far

1423
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,759
from B.

1424
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,759
Okay. So, uh

1425
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,480
let's say first step of proof. So, I'm

1426
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,480
not going to prove but

1427
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,880
well, we have to pick a row in 01

1428
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,880
carefully.

1429
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,480
In fact, it's going to be a power of

1430
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,319
delta as usual. Some power don't

1431
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,400
remember which power. One has to choose

1432
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,640
this power carefully. And then there are

1433
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:22,520
two cases that sort of morally

1434
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,520
correspond to those two cases.

1435
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:37,640
B now is that B that B up up there. Not

1436
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:37,640
an arbitrary B. that be is row dense.

1437
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,000
Row dense means that the largest gap is

1438
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:44,000
at most row

1439
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,880
or if you take the row neighborhood you

1440
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:51,679
cover everything everything is 01.

1441
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,679
So any questions about what row dense

1442
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,679
means?

1443
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:00,560
Okay. And here we use an argument which

1444
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:05,920
is similar

1445
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:08,960
to the case x - x /x sorry uh it's not x

1446
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:13,120
it's a minus a

1447
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:17,440
over a minus a equals fp

1448
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:21,360
to get growth

1449
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:24,960
which I'm not going to show

1450
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:28,239
this is the sort of easier case

1451
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,080
I here was also the easier case.

1452
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:37,560
Okay. And the other possibility is that

1453
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:37,560
there exist a B in B such that either

1454
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,360
B / 2 is far from B

1455
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:48,640
or

1456
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:52,280
B + 1 / two

1457
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,280
is far from B.

1458
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:59,320
in this sense.

1459
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:59,320
So there are two cases by dilemma.

1460
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,600
Okay. And then we use B over two or B

1461
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,080
plus one over two in a similar way to X

1462
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,640
the way that X + one was used in the

1463
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,640
final field setting

1464
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,120
to get expansion.

1465
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,960
And it works. is much more complicated.

1466
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:27,920
So the the actual details are much more

1467
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,920
complicated than in the final field

1468
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,920
setting

1469
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:39,440
but it works and

1470
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,360
I would say the overall idea is very

1471
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,360
similar but the details are much more

1472
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,360
complicated.

1473
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,800
Okay. So, so far so good module, lots of

1474
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:53,600
details, but uh this was the first step

1475
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,239
in the final field setting and we can

1476
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,880
replicate it. So, it seems that things

1477
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:02,199
are going well. But now we have a much

1478
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,199
bigger issue.

1479
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,960
Maybe I'm going to explain the much

1480
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:09,600
bigger issue and talk about how to

1481
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,760
overcome it next time because this is

1482
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,080
maybe the biggest issue, the biggest

1483
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,920
difference. Okay, you can see that this

1484
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,360
was already a big issue and a big

1485
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,320
difference in the proof. But now comes I

1486
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,840
would say a bigger issue.

1487
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,199
This was the first step in the final

1488
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,120
field setting. What is the second step

1489
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,440
in the final field setting? Iterate in

1490
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,520
the first step and you just iterate.

1491
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:32,080
Nobody's preventing you from iterating.

1492
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:35,040
So you get that Q of A growth. So you

1493
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,520
can do Q of Q of A.

1494
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,040
So here

1495
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:45,040
maybe let's call it the second step.

1496
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:48,640
You look at Q of Q of Q of Q of A

1497
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:51,520
and this is very large.

1498
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:54,080
So uh you can make it as close to P as

1499
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,239
you want

1500
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,880
in terms of powers.

1501
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:01,600
I don't know

1502
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,840
I don't know it. So for any ita if we

1503
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,800
iterate enough times we keep growing and

1504
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,640
we can reach any power we want. In fact,

1505
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,239
we actually eventually in the fin

1506
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,400
setting we get all of all of the finite

1507
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:13,840
field after iterating finite finitely

1508
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,080
many times. I don't know if you saw this

1509
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,480
but anyway so this is clear because we

1510
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,760
just keep iterating.

1511
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,760
Okay. So now let's go back to

1512
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:33,800
sorry did I ever state

1513
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,800
uh

1514
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:39,920
[Applause]

1515
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:41,440
oh here it is okay so here is the lema

1516
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:46,080
that

1517
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:48,640
I told you we can prove using this idea.

1518
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,560
So then this is the lema. So we have a

1519
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,560
delta s delta to the minus epsilon set

1520
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:56,159
of size delta t to the minus s. Then we

1521
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,640
apply q and the size grows.

1522
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:02,080
Okay. So what's the problem?

1523
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:04,480
We would like to iterate but we cannot.

1524
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,719
So why can we not iterate? Well,

1525
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,040
apparently we cannot. I'm not saying in

1526
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,960
the end we will iterate but why why is

1527
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:13,040
it completely unclear whether we can

1528
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,120
iterate?

1529
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,960
There's no guarantee that Q of A will

1530
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,920
satisfy the spacing condition.

1531
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,640
>> Exactly. That's the issue and it is a

1532
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,560
big issue. So we know that the size of Q

1533
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,080
of A grows.

1534
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,679
But here we have this additional

1535
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,199
assumption and we need it or we need

1536
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,120
some assumption. We need the assumption

1537
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:34,159
that A is a delta S delta to the minus

1538
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:36,159
epsilon set. So in order to iterate we

1539
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:38,960
would need to know that not only Q of A

1540
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:41,520
has grown in size but we would need to

1541
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,719
know that Q of A is a delta S plus

1542
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:47,679
epsilon delta to the minus epsilon set

1543
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,360
and we don't know that a priori if we go

1544
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,400
over the proof the proof doesn't show

1545
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:54,159
that so when we okay so I haven't given

1546
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,920
the proof of the lema only gave a very

1547
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:58,159
rough sketch but you have to trust me

1548
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,239
that if you go through the proof we do

1549
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:02,560
not get any non concentration for Q of A

1550
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,760
we literally only get get growth at

1551
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:10,120
scale delta.

1552
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,120
Okay, so let me write this somewhere.

1553
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:16,079
[Applause]

1554
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,080
Big issue

1555
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:37,719
We know

1556
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,719
Q of A grows

1557
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:47,159
in delta covering number.

1558
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,159
But

1559
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,040
the proof

1560
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,440
does not show

1561
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:06,719
that Q of A

1562
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
is a delta S plus epsilon could be a

1563
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,840
different epsilon that's we did the same

1564
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,640
epsilon but we need some epsilon if we

1565
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,640
want to iterate here

1566
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,719
Okay. So we are going to talk about some

1567
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,360
of the things we do to overcome this uh

1568
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:46,480
in the next lecture. But let me say that

1569
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,640
I think in fact it is not true that Q of

1570
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,199
A has to be a delta S plus epsilon delta

1571
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:54,159
2 minus epsilon set.

1572
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:57,360
It is not even true. But what is true is

1573
01:16:54,159 --> 01:17:02,120
that Q of A contains a delta S plus

1574
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,120
epsilon delta to the minus epsilon set.

1575
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,800
Okay. And this is good enough because we

1576
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,960
just just take that subset and use that

1577
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,600
to iterate and then we then we can

1578
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:49,440
iterate and the second step will work in

1579
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:51,360
the same way. But this is a big issue

1580
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,960
and somehow we have to go through the

1581
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,880
whole steps of the proof in the finite

1582
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,520
field setting

1583
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,440
just to get this and then we have to

1584
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,199
sort of do the full so one has to sort

1585
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:04,000
of cycle through all the steps twice in

1586
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,480
this proof. The first cycle is to solve

1587
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,520
this issue. So we have to use valuedic

1588
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,120
hours for example to solve this issue

1589
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,320
that comes much later in the proof in

1590
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,840
the finite field setting and then we

1591
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,360
have to use it again once we have

1592
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:19,920
expanded

1593
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:22,640
a lot uh by iterating okay so I'll

1594
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,120
explain uh the ideas behind this on

1595
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:28,000
Thursday yes for showing that QA

1596
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:29,679
contains the delta s plus epus epsilon

1597
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,040
set does that set have to be kind of

1598
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:38,520
very close to the size of a and like an

1599
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:38,520
s plus epsilon or delta spacing level.

1600
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,199
>> Well, it needs to be much okay. Uh

1601
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:47,600
something maybe I should have say but I

1602
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:50,000
didn't say is that a delta t c ignore

1603
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:54,000
this for a moment. So a delta t cz set

1604
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,520
has size at least delta to the minus t

1605
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,280
because you apply the definition of

1606
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,480
delta t cz set at scale delta. This is

1607
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,920
something I should have mentioned. I

1608
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:05,040
will try to remember to mention it next

1609
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,040
time. So this set that is contained

1610
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,440
actually has already size bigger than

1611
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:13,760
the size of a but in addition to having

1612
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:15,840
larger size it has good spacing.

1613
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,320
But yeah one question is that I'm going

1614
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,640
to answer next time is how how come that

1615
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,040
something contains so this notion of

1616
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,840
delta s set is bad in the sense that it

1617
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,159
is not monotone. So you can so if you

1618
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,400
take a set which has this non spacing

1619
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:33,440
condition or non concentration condition

1620
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:35,120
and make it larger you may lose

1621
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,640
the non concentration condition and

1622
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:41,080
that's kind of bad. So we'll see how to

1623
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,080
get around this next time.

1624
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,800
Any other questions?

1625
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,920
>> Yes.

1626
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,760
>> I wonder like in the two cases you wrote

1627
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,080
so in the first case you said the set is

1628
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:54,080
dense. So somehow it is large but in the

1629
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,640
second case what's the intuition behind

1630
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,800
okay I have one element that is far away

1631
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,320
from the set and then we can get the

1632
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,840
set. is really very similar to what you

1633
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,199
did in the final field setting. In the

1634
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:10,400
case when x is in a minus a over a minus

1635
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:11,760
a and x plus one is not. You use that to

1636
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,199
show that some projection of the

1637
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,600
original set is large.

1638
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:17,679
>> Okay?

1639
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,440
>> It's it's a very similar idea except

1640
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:22,000
that you have to fight with small

1641
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:26,040
denominators and but but morally it's a

1642
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,040
very similar idea. Okay.
