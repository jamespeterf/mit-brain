1
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,000
uh I'm going to switch over to the

2
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:21,039
Jupiter notebook to talk sort of a

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,199
review of last class and then going

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,400
forwards so what are some of the things

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,400
we unlocked last class so music 21

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,960
objects that we can

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,960
use shout them out

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,520
what's that stream good pitch Corpus I

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,600
heard anything else duration duration

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,680
and Pitch from duration lets you do what

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
not note good we remember that and

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
there's one other one uh I just want to

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,960
remind you we're not going to use it

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
very much it's called converter let me

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,120
make this a little bit bigger oh that's

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:01:00,280
nice for me too um and

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,719
sorry great um

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,960
and because converter does the same

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,720
thing as Corpus but loads any file on

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,799
your uh hard drive or anywhere on the

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,280
web but um since I don't know what your

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,960
what's on your hard drive uh we're not

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,320
going to use it that much great

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,560
um and what's something we did last

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,520
class what what's the problem so let's

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,560
all load our that Bo piece I remember

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:32,840
what I should type Corpus Corpus do par

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,040
parse good and and um I said it was Bach

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,200
bwv 66.6 the only thing you actually

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,200
need is whatever is necessary to

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,079
distinguish it from anything

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,280
else so you'll you'll sometimes see I'm

33
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,399
U going to be taking a shortcut there

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,920
good and uh how many things were in Bach

35
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,159
do we remember estimate six oh good we

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,320
have the exact number yep uh

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,200
why what where are the

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,119
notes we have a score object and pretty

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,680
sure just a

40
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:09,440
recall yep um we've score object and

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,520
then what's inside of it the main thing

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,360
four of the thing of the six thingss

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,920
parts good and then inside the part

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Hannah did you you had your hand up on

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,440
the last one I'll get you in uh what's

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,640
inside of a part uh measure measure

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,319
objects good and what's inside the

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,000
measure

49
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,879
objects notes and other things but

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,480
primarily so we have this higher

51
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:37,720
hierarchy this nested hierarchy score

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,200
Parts um measure notes there may

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,800
sometimes even be uh another level of

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,959
hierarchy for instance in scores like

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,680
this where you have two different voices

56
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,959
on the same part um there uh what do you

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,200
call it there may be a voice object

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,840
inside of a measure and if you have a

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,280
whole collection of scores we call it

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,720
something begins with an OP Opus Opus

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,360
yeah so there you can have something

62
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,480
that's bigger than a score you can have

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,879
opuses op opra technically an opus that

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,720
has scores inside it and then you can

65
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,159
put opuses inside opuses because I

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,640
didn't want to make anything bigger yeah

67
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,159
go ahead can we close the door oh yeah

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,280
sure sure can you close the door for

69
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:24,640
somebody who can get there thanks

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:28,439
um thank you appreciate it um great so

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,560
let's how did we get down to the

72
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:35,319
um how did we get down to the uh notes

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,760
last time we did something like um for

74
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,200
thing in score you don't have to type

75
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,879
this is all review in

76
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,879
Bach if thing in if uh we remember the

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,159
is instance is the python way of

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,480
figuring out um so I thing in score is

79
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,360
uh stream. part we can also just say

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,879
stream. stream if it's some sort of a

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,000
stream then for thing in part in thing

82
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,000
in

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,079
score I don't want to waste too much

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,079
time on this uh I can do

85
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,720
this if instance thing in part somebody

86
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,280
tell me if I type something wrong on

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,359
this because I'll probably do it and

88
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,360
that's not the there's no tricks on this

89
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,080
um for thing

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:30,840
in uh what is

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:34,840
it measure in thing in part

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:38,520
print thing in measure hopefully that

93
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,199
works yep so that let's us get down to

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,520
the lowest level of what's Happening

95
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,840
Here we have a whole bunch of notes what

96
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,720
are we doing is that are these are we

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,600
doing uh you'll remember the two

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,880
representations the Box representation

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,320
or the slami slice TimeWise

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,440
um what are we doing are we going

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,320
through all the parts here first or are

102
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,880
we going through one part and then

103
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,080
another hint you can always look back at

104
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,400
your score you know the piece and you

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
have the

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,840
notes go ahead and when you when you

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,759
have it just look up and then shout it

108
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:32,319
out part by part we're going part by

109
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:34,360
part right the soprano C Shar b a b c

110
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,919
formada oh it's nice to see that

111
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,240
formadas are not in here so they must be

112
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:43,720
someplace else e c yeah so we're going

113
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,039
uh part by part in this case

114
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,720
great um and we also saw last class that

115
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,520
we could do something if we knew exactly

116
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,360
where something was we could say B two

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,440
which I happen to remember there's a

118
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,880
metadata soprano then Alto so that would

119
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,199
be two uh I don't know let's choose a

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
random

121
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,560
measure and we can make a list out of

122
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,080
this I can't remember if I think I

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,280
demonstrated that and get what is in

124
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,960
here and we'll keep seeing that these

125
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,720
random other things keep popping up here

126
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,560
like system layouts and so on

127
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:28,039
um so um we'll need a better way to get

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,440
to notes questions this is review so I

129
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,120
went pretty fast but um the important

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,160
thing is if I'm reviewing it it's

131
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,039
probably important that we have good

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,960
understanding before we move

133
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,440
on yeah Jake curse on the first use so

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,960
we're going to get to that in just just

135
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,000
a second yep good yeah close that sure

136
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,720
great

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,360
great there we go sorry that the

138
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
blackout blind over there doesn't seem

139
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,440
to be

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
working

141
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,960
should um if email me after class I'll

142
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
REM remember to put in a facilities

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,759
request or if you email me right now in

144
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,080
class I'll you'll hear a ding then I'll

145
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,879
put in a facilities request because

146
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,280
that's going to get annoying as um after

147
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,240
daylight savings time starts for this

148
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,840
class good

149
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,120
um okay any any other things that we

150
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,840
want before from the review last time

151
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,479
yeah I showed a whole bunch of things on

152
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,759
the first class that are not on done yet

153
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,759
but we'll um we'll be getting to them

154
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,800
sooner so assume everything on the first

155
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,400
class I think I said at the end uh was

156
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,840
then immediately relocked but but as far

157
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,000
as recur this recurse thing um we're

158
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,919
going to get to it and unlock it in just

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,680
a few

160
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,800
seconds great

161
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,879
um so any any stream can be converted to

162
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,919
a list by doing it so we can get the

163
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,840
list of everything that's in the top

164
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,720
level score for Bach here and then we

165
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,199
can um

166
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,240
yeah do do other things and we can um

167
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,919
there are some differences between a

168
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,319
stream and a list that are pretty

169
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,000
important so when I say a list list

170
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,759
array in other languages what are some

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,879
of the things you can do um it's a

172
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,240
mutable container so what some things

173
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,120
you can do to

174
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,520
it yeah you can add to it you can add to

175
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,400
it great other

176
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,159
things usually can add you can yeah pop

177
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,680
you can pop things off of it great you

178
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,879
can remove things out of it what is some

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,479
other things that lists to uh yeah go

180
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,200
ahead you can change things at certain

181
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,320
indices you can change things at certain

182
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,399
indices yeah you can replace one thing

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,320
with another good any other things we

184
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,919
can do we're

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,920
getting yeah Jason find the length you

186
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,279
can find the length great you can find

187
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,640
the length and you can append to it and

188
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,360
change the length all those things um

189
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,880
one other thing beginning with uh

190
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,079
it you can do yeah John iterate you can

191
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,600
iterate it you can put into a for Loop

192
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,079
and get things great great any uh

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,360
there's one more over here splicing

194
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:08,040
splicing yeah you can you can CH get

195
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,920
little parts of it too so in this way a

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:16,240
stream really does work like a

197
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,120
um like a list we can get out get rid of

198
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,640
that metadata we can get rid of other

199
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,560
things here um if I had been smarter uh

200
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
20 years ago it probably would inherit

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,399
from list but it does not um but it has

202
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,200
a lot of things that are like list like

203
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,920
um but there's some things that you can

204
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,040
also do that are a little different

205
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,399
let's get um actually where what was

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,839
that over here um we went up to Bach

207
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,040
24 let's get that um out here I think

208
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,000
that should be

209
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:54,200
measure uh measure three let's see m m

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,399
equals this and we'll see what m is y

211
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,360
measure

212
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,360
three great so measure three of the

213
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,480
second thing up here so the third thing

214
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,480
because we're doing two Z index 0 one

215
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,240
two measure three of the Alto part here

216
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,680
is something that I don't think um for

217
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,839
all the amazing things MIT CS training

218
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,040
does I don't think it does very very

219
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,079
well I think that we this says measure

220
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,120
three of the Alto part and here's the

221
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,200
contents of it let's just go through and

222
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,040
make sure remember pickups are measure

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,320
what Z zero so let's make sure that this

224
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,320
is actually measure three uh

225
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,519
of is that right do we get the right

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
measure um the next problem set the one

227
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,440
that we're going to be talking about at

228
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,720
the end of class today uh it's not as

229
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,880
it's it's probably the least time

230
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,360
consuming of any of the ones you've had

231
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,880
so far so good I fig figure every third

232
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,519
one you need a little bit of break so

233
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,000
we'll go down on that I will tell you in

234
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,880
advance where people lose points on this

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,040
problem set is that they write the code

236
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,440
the code works and then they go on and

237
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,079
there's a little programming error

238
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,639
somewhere that could have easily been

239
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,760
fixed by looking at the score during

240
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:18,160
show and checking that your answer was

241
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,160
actually what it should be so just just

242
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,560
to have that there and that's now I've

243
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,639
uh you know my my feeling is everybody

244
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,880
can get an A+ we can all get perfects on

245
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,160
everything I don't need to do play

246
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,480
gotcha games for um you know hahaa now

247
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,959
now there's nothing to mark off so good

248
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,800
so make sure that you're always doing

249
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,639
that and make sure to do these uh call

250
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,600
them sanity checks that you're getting

251
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,680
out from your data what you should be

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,200
getting in okay so these are some things

253
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,000
that they're similar um one of the

254
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,160
things though in

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,200
uh so we have this measure object and

256
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,040
we'll look

257
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,760
oops shape of your brackets does matter

258
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,399
right

259
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:07,639
um you have something here now if this

260
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:10,440
was just a a normal list m.

261
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,000
insert to we're going to put it position

262
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,240
two let's put a note. note let's let's

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,440
do one that we can immediately recognize

264
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,079
a double flat for okay uh we can create

265
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,079
an object in here actually we'll we'll

266
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,760
be smart we'll call that n and Define it

267
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:31,160
before uh n equals so we can reference

268
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,519
it again sorry I'm try not to get this

269
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,519
at the very bottom of the screen

270
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,199
great so what should have happened if

271
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,839
this

272
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:54,279
were um If This Were a normal list where

273
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:59,560
should where would you expected to see

274
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:03,399
that double flat a double flat

275
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:07,040
after the G after the G I think

276
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,519
that everybody agree sometimes Professor

277
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,160
everybody agrees when the professor's

278
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,440
like yeah does it go after two or does

279
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
it I can't remember but yeah I'm pretty

280
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,959
sure that's right so it should be

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,199
somewhere over

282
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,720
here why is it here let's go back to

283
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:27,480
that Alto part measure

284
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,240
two and see it's coming after the C uh

285
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,160
does the C have a formada on it or

286
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,480
not just want to make sure we're all in

287
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
the same

288
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,000
place yeah John's John's nodding his

289
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,680
head and John's almost always right on

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,240
these things so good good um and yeah so

291
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,079
we have it on the last yah of that word

292
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,120
that I'm not going to say uh during Lent

293
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,800
right um and good so it's coming right

294
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,000
after there and yet we said we should

295
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:06,360
put it at

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,839
two what might be happening here get on

297
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:14,240
it's being put like the second beat well

298
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,079
zero index the second beat yeah Z this

299
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,120
with the beginning being zero now I told

300
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,480
you that's very very close to the right

301
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,399
answer so great great I said at the

302
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,639
beginning there was a reason why I

303
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,759
didn't like to use beat as a fundamental

304
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,759
unit what was that

305
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,279
or if if don't because of things like 58

306
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,199
where um fast

307
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:43,320
58 y one and and one and two and uh

308
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:47,639
where beats can change their duration

309
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,519
even within a measure so what might um

310
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,639
what's something equivalent what would

311
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,079
durations measured in I'm going to call

312
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,160
on Misha next but I want to make sure

313
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,720
that we have yeah yeah I think it was

314
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,800
just I think you said you use quarter

315
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,440
notes as your yeah so quarter links so

316
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,279
in this case it's exactly the same as

317
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,240
beat so this a correct answer in this

318
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:11,360
case because we're in 44 right but so we

319
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:16,839
put it in if what do we have 8th eth so

320
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:21,160
that's all within 0 0.5 one

321
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:25,079
two okay but there might be a problem

322
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,639
here why is it after the

323
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,600
C well let's let's do this we remember

324
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,720
some of our iteration for I'll still say

325
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,319
thing in M even though they're mostly

326
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:41,800
notes print thing and things new term

327
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,759
that we haven't seen it's

328
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,759
offset so the offset just like the

329
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,880
duration has a is measured in quarter

330
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,959
lengths the offset from the beginning of

331
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,360
the current container is measured in

332
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,120
quarter LS so we have here and we can

333
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,839
actually now have two notes at the same

334
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,240
time so you can have multiple position

335
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,279
things at the same position that makes

336
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,880
it a little bit harder to remove by um

337
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,519
by offset that you want to have because

338
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,240
there unlike in a array where there can

339
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:19,000
only be one thing at a particular index

340
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,880
here you can have multiple things at the

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,720
same index um this is a simplification

342
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,759
we'll see in a little bit that notes and

343
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,319
everything else can have an infinite

344
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:33,240
number of offsets simultaneously but um

345
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:36,399
this is good enough to start

346
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,440
here yeah go say if you do show it

347
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,440
doesn't like put them in the same place

348
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,360
H if you put it show it doesn't right

349
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,160
because not uh that that's that's a

350
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,920
great thing you're going to find it is

351
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,800
easy to create things that are valid

352
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:56,279
musical Concepts that cannot be shown by

353
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:58,440
any of our um of our sort of uh music

354
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,120
representation software our Muse scores

355
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,319
or alleys or whatever like that um why

356
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,360
because do you usually if you have a

357
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,559
part do you have two this is this is an

358
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,319
ontological question do you have two

359
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,319
notes that sound at the same time in one

360
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,480
part or do you have something else that

361
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
happens when you have two notes at the

362
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,760
same

363
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,799
time what what other representation

364
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,280
might be for two notes for two two

365
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,720
things that sounded the same same time I

366
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,720
won't sing

367
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,039
notes

368
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,919
anybody what do we different parts you

369
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,360
would have you would have a you could

370
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,679
have it in two different parts which is

371
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,720
what we've normally seen or

372
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,360
yep one person like going up yeah you

373
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,559
see you have a split yeah a split we

374
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,640
call those voices in this you have two

375
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,799
voices at that thing what's the other

376
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,840
other thing that um another fundamental

377
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,679
part of our

378
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,080
ontologies chord so in this case your um

379
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,120
software wants me to have created a

380
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,760
chord object which is not yet unlocked

381
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,039
for us out of these two so it just does

382
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,159
whatever it wants with it great question

383
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,039
super so keep playing with the limits

384
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,120
we're a little bit behind in time

385
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,280
because we're um we're really uh asking

386
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,799
great questions so I'm going to um hold

387
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,039
off a little bit on some until we can

388
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:35,039
get a little bit further into um some

389
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:39,320
things so let me um yeah question go

390
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,520
ahead how do you remove well um you'll

391
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,840
be able to you can either remove the

392
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,840
thing and it will find it or you can

393
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,919
remove something at an offset and we'll

394
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,880
get um that will be fortunately all of

395
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,720
these other things will be uh all these

396
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,280
other options uh will be uh revealed to

397
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,000
you in uh in the reading before next

398
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,679
time we meet together um which is the

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,520
users guide chapter on streams so I

400
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,679
think that remove is mentioned in there

401
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,760
it's can be a little bit more

402
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,679
complicated as I said so I want to um

403
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:18,480
hold that off for just a little

404
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:21,400
bit okay um let me do another little

405
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,120
thing for a second and we'll jump to

406
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,520
some ways that we can make our life

407
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,000
easier by not doing for thing and thing

408
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,720
then for next thing and thing next thing

409
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,760
and next thing and previous thing um

410
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,880
obviously we're going to have some other

411
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,600
um ideas so this is a one notion one way

412
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,039
of a score score might be represented in

413
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,360
music 21 with two parts and So within

414
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,240
the score and this its scores length is

415
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,960
how

416
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,400
much just Sout it

417
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,480
out two or three because we have this

418
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,360
metadata and so I've put underneath is

419
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,400
the offset of everything both parts

420
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,320
start at the beginning of the score

421
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,799
right so they have offset zero Within

422
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,799
part one there are two I'm calling

423
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:17,320
measures measure 1 a measure 2 a um

424
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,240
their offsets are at zero and four which

425
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,120
makes sense because somewhere in here

426
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,880
there's a

427
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:27,760
44 time signature right um and within

428
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,679
and notice though that when we're

429
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,720
looking at measure two measure 2's

430
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,039
offset is four but we start again with

431
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,120
offset zero so so if you want to know

432
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:43,080
how many quarter notes into the piece

433
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,080
quarter note 9 happens you'd have to add

434
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,080
2 +

435
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,919
4 plus

436
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,000
zero fortunately adding zero is easy so

437
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,960
get ah it's six quarter notes into the

438
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,679
piece so this is one uh the

439
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,280
representation that's

440
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,760
happening now when you iterate over the

441
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,520
score for uh I'll s use l element um

442
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,760
thing things comes off the tongue better

443
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,640
but L is quicker to type and um when you

444
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,240
do this you'll you'll see that that

445
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,919
we've already seen you get the

446
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,400
metadata you get part

447
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,679
one and then you get part two and that's

448
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,720
all right so you get the three things

449
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,039
that are there um the more powerful way

450
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,080
to do this is something called recurse

451
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,640
the recurse

452
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,360
method on here and um what this does is

453
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,200
it goes through the first thing and then

454
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,960
if there's anything inside the metadata

455
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,720
which there isn't it's not a container

456
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,559
it would go into it then part one is a

457
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,320
container class uh all containers are

458
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,520
called streams but the general term in

459
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,880
computational music theory is the

460
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,039
container and then within this container

461
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,000
we have another container and it will go

462
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,559
through uh these things that are not

463
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,480
containers sometimes these are called

464
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,400
leafes leaves the leaf mod node like in

465
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,360
a graph the thing that has no

466
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,840
Descendants on it and then it will go

467
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,279
through the second one then it jumps

468
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,720
back to part two and goes through each

469
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,200
one and tells you that so that's going

470
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:22,320
to be make life a lot easier let's

471
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:25,760
recurse through um do I have can I move

472
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:30,279
over here we go let's recurse through uh

473
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:35,480
Bach for l in Bach

474
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,480
recurse print let's do L and L's

475
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,000
offset oops and now I have to get my

476
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,120
scrolling

477
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,120
back

478
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,799
go so now we're seeing ah there's the

479
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,520
metadata there's the soprano part if we

480
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,320
were writing a program we could keep

481
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,880
track of what part we're certain we're

482
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,039
in at a certain point and every time we

483
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,120
see a new part do something and then we

484
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,760
see up where it measure zero

485
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,240
here we go here's all the different

486
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,640
things to measure one measure two and if

487
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,320
I scroll far enough eventually we should

488
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:16,840
see um Here We Go part

489
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,080
Alto so that's um it's pretty good there

490
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,600
this all this information about what's

491
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,679
its offset and things this can be done

492
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,840
also gotten um in a way that just prints

493
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,679
it's not useful for parsing I would not

494
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,400
say parsing this but if you do bach.

495
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,799
show

496
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,520
text and it just gives you basically the

497
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,240
same information as that routine but

498
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,880
nicely

499
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:50,039
formatted so I'll give second where the

500
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,720
current offset is given first and then

501
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:55,320
the next thing um also puts everything

502
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,480
like

503
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:03,039
this questions on this part

504
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,760
part okay now your computer science

505
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,720
question

506
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,840
recurse is what type of graph search

507
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,400
don't shout it out yet everyone think

508
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,039
what there are a number of ways of of

509
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,159
searching through a a graph or iterating

510
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:23,039
through a graph what kind would we call

511
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,520
this us I'll give you a hint the second

512
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,200
word is usually

513
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,240
first okay that wasn't much of a hint so

514
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,240
okay uh give raise your hand if you're

515
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,840
confident that you know the answer to

516
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,399
this now and raise go like this if

517
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,200
you're if you're not confident that you

518
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,159
know the answer great could you talk

519
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,640
with the person next to you uh and

520
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,600
especially if you're some if you have

521
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,120
couple people who aren't so confident uh

522
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:52,120
just and share your answer and see if

523
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:55,799
you're in the same um same boat

524
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,799
okay who is who is uh now a little bit

525
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,520
less is still unconfident who who's come

526
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,000
to an agreement on your thing you're you

527
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,000
guys are still in disagreement no you're

528
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,559
you're in agreement good good okay so um

529
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,840
let's all shout it out at us the kind of

530
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,720
search is

531
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,320
a first search a depth first search good

532
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,320
so we're always going to be following

533
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,159
the leftmost I should do this in

534
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,240
different colors so it's easier to see

535
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:29,440
um right the leftmost node that we

536
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,960
haven't yet seen and doing something

537
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,559
with that and then going back up here

538
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,159
going back up down right does that

539
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,799
seem to fit other people's computer

540
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,840
science things I have neither a

541
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,039
concentration minor major um or PhD in

542
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,679
computer science so please if I get

543
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,320
something wrong you all shout to me

544
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,440
because you've done more of that than I

545
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,240
have okay great so we have depth first

546
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,880
search what are some of the things uh

547
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,320
anybody knows from other things that

548
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,399
depth first searches are good for and

549
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,039
what are some of the things that they're

550
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:06,799
not good

551
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,799
at so good for anybody wants

552
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:15,880
say don't worry it's a safe space

553
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,159
and shortest path problem shortest path

554
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,679
problem good good shortest path problem

555
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,240
anybody do you want to explain or

556
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,080
anybody else want to explain what that

557
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,080
is for those who

558
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,720
have shortest path between two notes

559
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,120
right how to how to get there right you

560
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,919
don't might not want to do something

561
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,919
else that might be good

562
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,320
for yeah just when you're in a scenario

563
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,000
where you think you want look over like

564
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,840
every possible

565
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,320
option great when you scenario where you

566
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,640
want to look at every possible object

567
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,760
now that there's other search methods

568
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,399
that also have that um property but this

569
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,159
one has that property so it's already a

570
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:58,679
lot better than for thing and thing than

571
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,480
thing and thing thing and thing right

572
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,039
you know that you're going to get to

573
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,039
every Point what's something it might

574
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,760
not be good

575
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:09,840
for that another search method might be

576
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,840
a better way of doing

577
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,080
it yeah case of like breath resch versus

578
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,919
depth resarch like if something's close

579
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,120
by there's not a lot of it or the tree

580
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,880
is like super deep but the answer is

581
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
like super close yep dep research will

582
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,520
search through everyone like to go to

583
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,960
the depths of the tree just check in the

584
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,480
first couple great super super and we

585
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,240
should we should say what we're

586
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,880
comparing um there's lots and lots of

587
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,320
searches but the two key key ones we

588
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,840
have depth first search and it's

589
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,840
compared to what bread first search yep

590
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,679
the the breakfast search as I always say

591
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,840
breath first search so that one um what

592
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,120
are we going to do if we want to a bre

593
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,600
first search in here what are we going

594
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,600
to see

595
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,440
first what's the first node we're going

596
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,120
to visit SC SC the score right good so

597
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,159
so far it's exactly the same as a depth

598
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,399
for second node we're going to see in

599
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,640
this High part one good third note part

600
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,519
two ah okay so we're already different

601
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,960
next

602
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,960
note was one yep so would isn't BFS

603
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,880
better for shortest path

604
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,080
searching rather than DFS it depends on

605
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,720
what how you're doing your path if

606
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,559
you're looking for dist one like pass

607
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,480
and you want to find the first one that

608
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,360
gets you there that's better you're like

609
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,360
positive L

610
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,919
distances trying to remember the exact

611
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,679
what I remember which one of these like

612
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,640
AAR even better yeah so we'll get to

613
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
these particular types of searches later

614
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,880
uh controversy in the class I'll try to

615
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,399
remember exactly what which one uh do we

616
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,919
have a um but yeah I'll I'll Trust um

617
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,519
that we'll solve that because we're not

618
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:57,600
going to be doing uh shortest path yet

619
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,000
um in this in this class but we'll we'll

620
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,360
see that there's there's certain

621
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,080
advantages to one versus the other the

622
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,559
other um thing so what's a musical thing

623
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,640
that we want to uh how about this um do

624
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,640
all parts start with the same um with

625
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,679
the same uh key

626
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,080
signature bread first or depth

627
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,159
first which one's going to be fastest to

628
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,640
get you your

629
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:27,840
answer I heard depth and breadth who's

630
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,519
on depth who's on breath yep okay good

631
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,480
so we're going to want to have both

632
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:35,760
types of searches

633
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:39,559
available um so recurse will give you

634
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,600
always um a what do you call it the uh

635
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,640
depth for

636
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,159
search there's another one that we're

637
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,760
going to have and um you're going to see

638
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,440
it's the flatten operation and you're

639
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,880
going to see it sometimes in my old

640
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,679
slides I haven't figured out how to

641
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,919
update um flat but it's it used to be a

642
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,960
proper

643
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,159
um that is to say you didn't need the

644
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,519
calls called Flat now it's a method

645
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,240
called Flat in U thing there are two

646
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:12,559
reasons for this one if anybody has a

647
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,200
new um uh uses an IDE like VSS code or

648
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,960
py Charm or something like that which I

649
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,760
highly encourage you to do um you know

650
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,919
it's nothing Elite to use vhm anymore uh

651
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,799
in life um then a lot of those will now

652
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,679
um go through and call and check every

653
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,760
one of the properties as point so it can

654
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:34,480
repeat for you and flat ended up being

655
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,159
um for a very very large score um very

656
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,279
time uh very space and time sensitive

657
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:41,880
and so I would uh once I upgraded to a

658
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,799
thing I realized okay that that can't

659
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,519
work anymore that flat so we had to do

660
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,000
it this I also wanted to make it a few

661
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,360
more letters so that people would stop

662
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,640
calling flat instead of recurse uh just

663
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,559
because it was less to type so now that

664
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,720
now they're much more equal flatten and

665
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,559
what flatten does is it gives you the

666
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,240
option of doing everything first that's

667
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,320
at the same

668
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,600
offset everything so we start with I

669
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,960
think I have an animation on this the

670
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,559
metadata

671
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,559
again we get one

672
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,559
cff next Cliff both the time signatures

673
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,480
everything that's at the same point when

674
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,639
you have a half note here we'll get both

675
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,240
e both quarter notes before getting to

676
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:33,240
the other thing the other thing that

677
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,120
flatten does that's different is you'll

678
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,360
see the offsets are now because it's

679
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,480
flattened um it's they're now all

680
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:47,120
relative to the start of the

681
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,679
score so um because of this they're

682
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,840
implemented in different ways recurse

683
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:56,200
the bread for search just sort of has a

684
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,720
little pointer that's going around

685
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,279
figuring out where I am figuring out how

686
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,480
to to go back up to the next hierarchy

687
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:06,000
level and walk around and do this so

688
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,559
it's very very fast and not very memory

689
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,880
intensive the flatten on the other hand

690
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:13,519
in order to compute where everything

691
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,159
should be and which one is actually

692
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,519
coming next into this hierarchy and for

693
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:24,039
historical reasons flatten will take

694
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:27,600
that same score and put it all into a a

695
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:30,159
a new score object a new thing but with

696
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,360
oh it also removes all the parts and

697
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,159
stuff uh flatten there are no parts or

698
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,320
anything there's just the things just

699
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,960
the leaf nodes at the end so you'll get

700
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,360
the clef the other cleff the time

701
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,080
signature the other time signature and

702
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,080
so on all in a new stream

703
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,919
object and this is the first time when I

704
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:57,200
was saying that a note might have more

705
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,600
than one offset because this is the same

706
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,880
oops

707
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,399
this quarter note here is the same as

708
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,240
that quarter note there so do offset

709
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,000
will be changing as this

710
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,840
happens um this is something that will

711
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,320
occasionally bite you but usually not

712
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,399
what does um which offset does it tell

713
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,960
you when you put dot offset it tells you

714
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:25,480
whatever the offset is in the last

715
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,480
stream that you iterated over that um

716
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,840
has that object in it

717
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,840
so we call that the active

718
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,600
site so it tells you the offset in its

719
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,600
active

720
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:46,840
site you will find that um it's often

721
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,840
you're looking at something in a

722
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,760
flattened stream that should say

723
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,399
flattened up there and you want to know

724
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,919
something about oh I've uh professor

725
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,760
cber said get me all of the notes

726
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:03,919
between off set five and seven and tell

727
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,639
me what measure they're in shoot we've

728
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,240
gotten all things five seven from the

729
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:10,839
beginning of the score um the problem is

730
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,520
we've lost all the measure information

731
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:17,079
we here so there is a property on all

732
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,320
streams. derivation do origin which will

733
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,040
take you back to the original the place

734
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,359
where it came from so the pre flatten

735
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,320
stream and that's something you're going

736
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,040
to be working with a lot um this is an

737
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,520
on logical Choice I've made on how

738
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,760
things are R how flattened versions of

739
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:40,440
scores have a derivation to the origin

740
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,919
of the original score uh now I'll take

741
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,720
questions on anything it's pretty

742
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:47,280
confusing it's a lot to jump in yeah

743
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,960
Adam last time what was verba in the in

744
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,839
the German Anthem coding what was what

745
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,440
what was at the very very top I said it

746
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,560
was the composer oh boom okay so we're

747
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,320
jumping jumping quite a bit back uh it's

748
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,800
the location uh Bohemian uh originally a

749
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,800
Bohemian

750
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,320
song that that is that was a pop quiz to

751
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,119
see what I remembered great

752
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:18,040
um any other questions on on this

753
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,040
material specifically and then uh on

754
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:30,119
anything okay well let's

755
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:34,240
um let's start start by having a little

756
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:36,079
bit of programming exercise time um we

757
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,359
have this Bach

758
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,880
Corral bwv

759
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:47,440
66.6 are there more Yep go ahead so does

760
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:51,359
flat mate object so flatten mutates

761
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,839
um yes it it mutates something on every

762
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,000
object called sites that keeps track of

763
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,800
where things are but it does not um

764
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,839
change I think there were some choices

765
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,960
that um now that music 21's 20 years old

766
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:06,599
almost um there's some things that I

767
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,760
would have done differently and I think

768
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,800
it probably time for somebody who's um

769
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,720
you know younger and more ambitious and

770
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,720
wants to do something for the next 20

771
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,200
years uh to come up with things because

772
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,760
I did not listen to our great software

773
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,520
engineering Professor Peter Jackson's uh

774
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,680
warnings against mutability uh in

775
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,960
objects as well as I should have and now

776
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm trying to make more things immutable

777
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,359
but you will find um that a lot of

778
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,800
things will by default not mutate but

779
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,440
then can and objects can be mutated so

780
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,119
that's great question everyone knows

781
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,960
mutable versus immutable objects you can

782
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,359
change you Cann lists

783
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,319
are what is the equivalent of a list in

784
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:51,000
Python that is immutable tup Tuple good

785
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,160
good you all say Tuple here I always le

786
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
as Tuple but Tuple okay

787
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,640
great super um well so here's uh any

788
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,319
other questions before I go on to my

789
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,760
question for you about

790
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:09,839
Bach okay here is the question for

791
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,839
you um to answer and let's do this in

792
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:17,640
groups of two because it's much more fun

793
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,920
to uh be talking to does Bach use more

794
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,920
ascending

795
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,599
notes or descending

796
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,240
notes descending

797
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,240
notes or about the same

798
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,040
I mean you might think the peace the

799
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,440
peace doesn't start off Hallelujah and

800
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,880
end right and it doesn't go the opposite

801
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,160
so it must be about the same maybe but

802
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,079
we'll see so talk um who's everyone know

803
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,640
who they're going to be paired up

804
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,599
with paed it's easier if you're sitting

805
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,280
on thing s PA paed great so start

806
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,480
talking about um about how you how

807
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,440
you're going to do this and what which

808
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,440
type of I a great question

809
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:09,560
flat flatten why does flatten

810
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,680
show because it's able ah because recurs

811
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,520
is not a stream recurs isn't yeah so I

812
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,680
should say recur recurse just gives you

813
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,079
an iterator around that you could do um

814
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,000
recurse thing and then there's a DOT

815
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,520
stream that you can put onto it and

816
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,520
that'll give you a stream but it's just

817
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,839
going to give you the same thing you

818
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,960
started with because yeah I

819
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,680
don't no no no then do it then yeah

820
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,240
thank you thank you always say we're

821
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,440
going to talk first about how to do it

822
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,960
then then implement

823
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,240
but I don't it's in class I don't care

824
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,760
however you'd like to do it but but

825
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,760
always start talking then

826
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,440
implementing okay I'm hearing the

827
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,079
discussion start uh dying down and

828
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,640
hearing some some clicks you can keep

829
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:02,640
talking but just informal poll which

830
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,440
which groups are on are on team

831
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,560
flatten we got one two three good good

832
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,760
which groups are on team recurse is the

833
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,720
best way good good good and which groups

834
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,440
are in team for thing and thing and

835
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,240
thing and thing and thing okay there's

836
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,359
one no just there was a smile with that

837
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,839
one okay so keep keep going there's ways

838
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,960
um to keep working on it I think you'll

839
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,280
find there's one that's better than the

840
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,480
other but we'll figure out which one

841
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,480
that

842
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,480
is and if you're lucky to be sitting

843
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,000
next to a group that's on the different

844
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,760
team maybe talk across groups and figure

845
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,119
out

846
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,599
we'll dialogue across religions and

847
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,599
political

848
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,560
views I'm going to interrupt for one one

849
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,560
second to say something that I've heard

850
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,319
just a second uh should yeah just one

851
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,040
second can I interrupt for one second to

852
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,920
say something I have heard from two

853
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,400
different groups Matthew get introduced

854
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,200
for two different groups um I have heard

855
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,640
this something like oh but think of the

856
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,520
memory we're going to have to keep a

857
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,839
reference to the previous note what is

858
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,200
to keep a reference to the previous note

859
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:19,599
what is the the Big O memory

860
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,960
consideration that we're thinking

861
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:28,560
about what one do we care about o of one

862
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,400
memory no no we do not not good keep

863
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,200
going with that just wanted to make sure

864
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,599
that we had that we don't care about o

865
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,520
of one operations very often

866
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:41,119
occasionally but just piece just this

867
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,240
piece oh oh it was just this I I just

868
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,240
heard is it just this piece or Olive

869
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,280
Bach um just this piece is what I'm

870
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,920
asking for but you could do

871
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:58,200
for

872
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,200
Corral in Corpus

873
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,079
so you um Derek if you wanted

874
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,760
to there is a for Loop you can do above

875
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:23,160
it and since we've unlocked Corpus that

876
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,319
will give you all looking good good so

877
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,520
if anybody if anybody's finished and's

878
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:29,960
gotten a thing oh a couple questions

879
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,440
once once you have that they're not

880
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,359
exactly the same I'll say that and what

881
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,000
explain what are some features in the

882
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,880
Corral that explain that the other thing

883
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,040
you could do

884
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,040
is do this for all 360

885
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,000
Cals that's a lower case C

886
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,160
Corpus do

887
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,720
coral. okay uh just before we go who

888
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,040
just uh who is still on who is still on

889
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,040
team

890
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,319
flatten you use flatten a little bit

891
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,079
okay and who who actually it will say

892
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,359
who used flatten anywhere in that score

893
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,400
and who used recurse anywhere in this

894
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,960
score okay I'm curious how um how did

895
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,520
flatten work for getting getting this

896
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,240
did you do you have the same she your

897
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,760
first flat it and it's the same for

898
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,880
ascending and then for descending we're

899
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,079
off by you interesting I'll be curious

900
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,800
to see how that that happened um great

901
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,800
um so I think we're we're wrapping up a

902
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,800
bit you can keep um keep working

903
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,480
obviously I'm um what is it item nine on

904
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,599
your thing sound to score I it's one of

905
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,680
my favorite things to teach in class cuz

906
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,280
it's really really fun but I have made a

907
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,359
video so we can save some time outside

908
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,760
um and that uh I'll add that that's

909
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,319
about a 10 minute to watch there's um

910
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,880
trying to make it quite a bit easier on

911
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,559
this this weekend try to make it a

912
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,680
little bit lighter so it's just some um

913
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,880
some interesting added things that are

914
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,920
happening there and um for the first

915
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,319
time I'm going to really recommend that

916
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,559
you um read the music 21 users guide

917
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:26,040
chapters uh there's an optional one

918
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,200
chapter 26 at the end you don't need to

919
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,040
read it because it's a little bit

920
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,160
complex but if you do read it and get

921
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,839
through it uh there are some tips in

922
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,839
there that can make some aspects of the

923
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:41,240
problem set three uh a little bit easier

924
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,280
so um any any other questions on what we

925
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,640
did oh one one last thing one last thing

926
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,599
on on this um I always recommend and I

927
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,240
really really recommend uh readable code

928
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,119
right readable code write code so that

929
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,720
you can do this collaboration and give

930
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:00,880
it to friends right things like that but

931
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:04,319
one year a while back um the um the

932
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,440
class did decide to go code golfing on

933
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,480
this particular uh thing to see who

934
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:14,960
could write the um shortest uh code to

935
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,200
do all this and uh I oops sorry why do

936
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,240
they do that to the eyes because uh back

937
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,760
then we were using uh Piaza for a

938
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,400
discussion board which used a

939
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,559
proportional font so using eyes made it

940
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,319
also makes it a little bit more

941
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,920
scrutable so never write code like this

942
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,000
but um I do believe that that works if

943
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,920
you want it and um you're Prof

944
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,240
one but see if you can beat uh that one

945
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,240
thanks everybody
