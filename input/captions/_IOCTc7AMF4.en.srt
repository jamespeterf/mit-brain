1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,240
hello everybody and thank you so much

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,280
for coming today my name is Daphne and

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,400
I'm the CEO and co-founder of hereon AI

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,799
and I believe that companies like yours

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,599
with all of your resources affect change

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,840
on a global scale every single day but

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,680
are those resources being utilized as

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,439
effectively as they possibly could be

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,119
what if I were to tell you that in the

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,960
next decade 75% of accountants plan to

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,320
retire who here relies on accounting

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,840
professionals I know that I do so this

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
is actually going to leave a really

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,680
large gap in business analytics and so

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,160
let me give you a quick example my

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,160
friend Steve he is a VP at a Fortune 100

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,160
company he oversees about 200 staff and

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,360
a $500 million budget and even Steve is

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,480
having issues generating reports for a

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,879
quarterly meeting Steve is already

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,600
seeing turnover in his financial

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,120
analysts and accountants and because of

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,320
this it's now taking Steve about four

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,199
months to generate reports that should

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,759
take less than a

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,520
week with Steve uh he has over a dozen

27
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,240
people that work with him and what ends

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,200
up happening is he gets about a 5inch

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,400
thick binder with 150 different tabs and

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,520
this all culminates with the CEO flying

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,439
in a 100 senior Executives coming to the

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
table they go line by line through these

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
documents to make decisions about their

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,840
company does this sound familiar to

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,680
anybody

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,280
here and even after all of this it's

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
still still takes a lot of time to

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,159
actually Implement these

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,240
decisions so I know that I was like

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,159
Steve when I was in my first company I

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,720
was generating literally gigabytes of

42
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,560
data to try to understand the health of

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,640
my business the health of my clients

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,399
businesses and it was taking too much

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,320
time and I have a PhD in this stuff and

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,079
because of that I decided to do what any

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Sayan person would do and I built my own

48
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:59,439
platform uh this platform was the point

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,320
of it was to expedite my uh analytics so

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,759
there was a client portal clients could

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,600
sign in and within seconds they would be

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,159
able to see how things were going with

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,160
their business based on the services

54
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,080
that we were

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,520
providing today we call this Heron AI

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,280
Heron AI is able to connect with over

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,920
150 different sources including Legacy

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,000
systems that you may be using one other

59
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,400
benefit of hereon AI is that we actually

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,640
have the ability to analyze clean and

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
visualize Excel data and this can be

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
done in under five

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
minutes on top on top of that when we

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,519
are able to ingest the data we have a

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,400
proprietary method that cleans your data

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,120
whether it's from an API or from an

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,879
Excel sheet from there it will analyze

68
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,239
that data also using proprietary methods

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,879
and then it will be able to geniz uh

70
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,680
generate customized dashboards and also

71
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:54,599
reports and this is now all done within

72
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,080
five minutes versus several

73
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,400
months so Steve decided to switch over

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,840
to use here on AI he connected some of

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,319
his leg software his Excel he was able

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,959
to connect that basically 5in thick

77
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:11,959
binder and what he was able to get out

78
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,120
in less than five minutes was not only

79
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,360
entire dashboards that he could now

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,560
utilize to track how things were going

81
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,400
in his Department he was also able to

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,920
get some action items that were telling

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,440
him where were his dependencies where

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,080
could he diversify his income were there

85
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,200
certain accounts receivables that he

86
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,640
really needed to be paying attention to

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,400
and the best part of this is that it he

88
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,360
could sync his data at any point in time

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
and these action items would update so

90
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,599
that as he progressed as he worked

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,280
through these action items now there

92
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,000
were new ones so that he could continue

93
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,640
to grow and focus on value

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,879
creation 81% of Corporations still

95
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,920
utilize Legacy software and still

96
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,439
utilize Excel today I know that I

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,079
absolutely do and I'm sure that there

98
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,720
are some people in this audience who do

99
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,840
as well if you're like me if you're like

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,640
Steve you really want to get more

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,959
insight out of this information this

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
super critical information that you're

103
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,560
spending a lot of money and time

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,159
collecting currently we are looking for

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,320
poc's we are uh fully developed and

106
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,680
we're about to be stocked to uh

107
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,479
compliant we also are about 16% more

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,240
accurate than the leading agentic

109
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,520
software in the market because of some

110
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,600
of the proprietary steps that we take

111
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,880
and so if you are somebody on this

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840

would love to talk to you about how here

115
