1
00:00:00,655 --> 00:00:03,655
(regal music plays)

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,703
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:23,266
(Professor Wallace laughing)

4
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,879
(music continues)

5
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,470
- So, on Friday, we talked
a bit about scheduling,

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,531
and you'll really need to maintain one

7
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,940
if you want to work effectively as a team

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,880
and manage that path to
your first prototype.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm David Wallace,

10
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,623
a Mechanical Engineering
Design Professor At MIT.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,650
Goals are essential, and
I mean precise goals.

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,680
That's because meeting goals, milestones,

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,830
is how we measure getting things done.

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,910
A systematic set of goals
that build upon each other

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,163
are the path to success.

16
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:19,235
(chick chirping)

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,640
Have you heard of the
phrase one-hit wonder?

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,350
It's the idea that we've done
something great, it's a hit,

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,800
but we have no idea how we did it,

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,053
and we can never do it again.

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,493
We don't want that.

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,490
Having a set of well-defined
goals, a process,

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,930
is the ticket to succeeding
over and over again

24
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,660
without being overwhelmed.

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,913
Goals keep us on track.

26
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,940
So,

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,400
This is how I explain the concept

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,573
in our MIT Mechanical
Engineering Product Design class.

29
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,273
May I introduce the Chicken Chart?

30
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,130
The Chicken Chart is actually
just a developmental timeline

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,560
for the gestation of a chicken,

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
but it's a really great metaphor
for product development,

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,083
or really completing any project.

34
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,810
So let's take a closer look at the chart.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,740
So here we are.

36
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,920
Roughly 19 days, depending
on when your lab is,

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,290
and we pretty much have an idea, right?

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,540
A very nice, fertile idea.

39
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,250
We have a fertile idea, kind
of like a chicken embryo,

40
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,860
and we have limited resources.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,080
That's the yoke.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,680
It's money, people, equipment, time.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,450
Time is a big one.

44
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,420
And there's a lot of growing
to be done along the way.

45
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,030
So the yolk, the resources
have to be metered

46
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,380
in just the right amount,

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,660
so it's utilized to the fullest,

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,540
but we don't run out.
(chick chirps)

49
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,860
On the gestation timeline,

50
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,930
we go through a series of checkpoints,

51
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,433
developmental milestones.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,570
The first milestones focus
on exploring opportunities,

53
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,200
needs, and pitching high-level
ideas for new products.

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,573
And we're talking hundreds of ideas.

55
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,110
Next, we have the sketches and mockups,

56
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,093
where things begin to slowly take form,

57
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,820
and, like the chicken,

58
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,713
things can be pretty ugly.

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,883
The idea is there, but
it's not fully formed.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,930
Then, when each team
lands on the one big idea

61
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,120
that they'll present together on stage,

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,000
things really start to take shape.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,217
- [Team] Woo!

64
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,050
- [Professor Wallace] They grow,

65
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,000
and you really start to see

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,550
what the final prototype
will eventually look like.

67
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,540
(upbeat music)

68
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,760
Having these goals to hit along the way

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,830
helps us to constantly keep ourselves

70
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,020
and our progress in check,

71
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,790
whether they're massive milestones

72
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,640
or the many smaller goals in between.

73
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,230
But whatever the goal may be,

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,110
all of them are essential to the task,

75
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,130
all keeping us on the
roadmap to a good product,

76
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,763
a product that is magic for the users.

77
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,400
And if all goes well,

78
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,090
we'll have the most beautiful
chick we can create.

79
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,730
But if we don't hit those milestones,

80
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,915
well, we may be fried.
(chick screaming)

81
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:31,665
(Professor Wallace laughing)

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,550
So, think about something
that you wanna do.

83
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,710
What is the end goal?

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,300
Really define it.

85
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,360
Think about the goals
that will lead you there.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,570
Frequent small goals that build a path

87
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,923
to your final outcome.

88
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,538
(students cheering)

89
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:54,371
What resources do you need,

90
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:57,180
or just what do you have to work with?

91
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,037
Put it on a timeline.

92
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:04,037
You have a plan, stick to
the plan, and always deliver.

93
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,660
That is the chicken chart.

94
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,973
We will be putting this in the lab.

95
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:13,740
Goals are essential.

96
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,549
They really are your friend.

97
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,799
Play seriously.
