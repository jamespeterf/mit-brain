1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:19,720
okay so good

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,720
morning we're back to

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,840
243 so let me just very briefly review

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,160
what we've done uh the last

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,879
sign we are in part one

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,320
and we riew some of the basic

7
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,480
definitions up to the statement on the

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,920
second law and we have to pick it up

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,920
from there

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,360
uh just quick reminder we said what we

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,039
mean by the word system and we explain

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,160
that the word system is loaded with

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,520
meaning it's not just uh that anything

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,480
can be assisted it has to

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,440
qualify uh in particular there is a

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:08,080
constraint on how the external uh forces

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,920
should be uh mounted in your model they

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,640
must not depend on coordinates of

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,640
external constituents of your

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,920
system later on we'll see that we there

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,280
is also another uh constraint reg

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,320
relating to

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,920
correlations also

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,880
uh this means that your this your system

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,759
should not um depend uh on

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,920
uh be cooperative with some other system

27
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,159
if if it is you have to consider also

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,920
the other uh system in order for it to

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:50,200
call to be called a system uh in our uh

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,880
in our little

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,840
business in our little uh

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,680
um

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,799
the then we design the property uh as

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,280
being

35
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,960
physical observable so something that

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,960
you would

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,760
um obtain by PR your system in some way

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,360
according to some recipes some

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,319
measurement procedure and measurement

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,040
procedures are what define those

41
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,680
properties and we gave uh the

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,519
measurement procedure for a for

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,920
example we talked about what we mean by

44
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:33,680
the word State it's the list of numbers

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,680
that

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,879
uh give the values of the properties at

47
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
one instant of of

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,000
time and the time

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:53,120
evolution is described by equation of

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,680
motion in a detailed

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,879
um

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,360
model but it can also be uh described by

53
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,760
just an initial State the final State

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,760
and uh um a description of the effects

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,319
that occurred outside of your system um

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,319
during that time

57
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:21,560
interval in either

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,040
way we have a few things to check in

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,840
particular important business obser

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,120
Dynamics is that uh it has to you have

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,640
to check two things one the consisten

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,400
the first

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,319
law which would be a

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,120
theorem in the framework in which you

65
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,959
start from the equation of motion

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,640
theorem of the equation of

67
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,519
motion and you also have to check the

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:52,200
second law which would be another

69
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,200
theorem of the uh dynamical

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:02,079
equation the idea of process I already

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:05,159
said um it's three things initial State

72
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,239
final State and effects on the

73
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,040
environment of the system and uh how do

74
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,840
we account for effects in the

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,199
environment well uh the most we can say

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,359
is how it

77
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,359
State uh

78
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,160
changes then by defining uh the weight

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,080
process namely one in which the only

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,440
external effect is the uh highly lifting

81
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,520
or lowering of the weight in a gravity

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,759
field which is a prototype of the

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,440
mechanical

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,039
effects we could introduce the statement

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,039
of the first

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,000
law it is an ingredient of that

87
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,520
statement it says that you take any

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,800
system and any pick any two states of

89
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,759
that

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:02,720
system they can always be interconnected

91
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,440
by means of a weight

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,919
process you not always you can do it in

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,680
uh either the direction you want but if

94
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,479
you cannot do it in One Direction you

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,479
can do it in the

96
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:23,800
other and then gives grounds for the

97
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,520
definition of uh of support for the

98
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,400
measurement procedure uh that we

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:35,080
introduce to define the property en

100
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:40,160
without the first law you

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,720
couldn't assert that by making this

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,280
procedure you

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,280
get property valuable

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,720
property so essentially this is the main

105
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,000
uh uh the most important consequence of

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,280
the first law is the existence of

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,759
property energy which yes then it is

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,039
addied it can be exchanged between

109
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,039
systems and uh its

110
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:11,440
concern and that gives rise to the

111
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,840
energy imbalance uh

112
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,599
equation with this

113
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,120
symbol which you have applied in your

114
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:25,720
undergrad courses or previous

115
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:29,400
uh we every every time we we perform a

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,199
model we we perform an energy balance to

117
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,599
account for to check that the difference

118
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,360
between the final and initial value of

119
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:42,520
property

120
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,680
energy is equal to the energy that uh

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,599
the net energy that is being received by

122
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,280
the system during that time

123
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:54,280
interval so that's a statement of uh

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,919
conservation of that so some people call

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,199
this I write the first law but I prefer

126
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,199
to say I write the energy balance

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,000
then we headed towards the second law by

128
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,319
introducing this idea of

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
um classification of States based on how

130
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,199
they change in time and why they change

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,160
in time particular we focused on

132
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,520
equilibrium for the moment but later on

133
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
we will focus on non

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,319
equilibrium and there is equilibrium an

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,000
equilibrium and we Define what we need

136
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,879
by stable equilibrium and meta

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,919
equilibrium the Sable equilibrium States

138
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,160
is most important because it enters the

139
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,840
statement of the second law and uh it is

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,720
defined as a

141
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,319
state uh an equilibrium state so that

142
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,080
means it doesn't move doesn't change in

143
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,080
time it doesn't move in in state space

144
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,319
so it doesn't uh change with

145
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,159
time

146
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:05,840
and and you cannot change it

147
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:08,159
without uh uh paying a cost uh without

148
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,080
having some net external effects you

149
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:16,240
need to uh spend something in order to

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:18,319
change a stable equ you cannot do it

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,360
uh for

152
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,560
free so to

153
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,199
speak and here is the statement of the

154
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,080
second law it is also made up of two

155
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,319
assertions uh let's start first with the

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,719
uh we focus first on

157
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,959
uh certain

158
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,719
wine it responds to the question uh how

159
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:44,320
many stable equilibrium states do a

160
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:48,600
system hand in a way that is apparently

161
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,600
contradicting the what we know from

162
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,800
mechanics uh because it says that uh if

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,680
you fix for your system the amounts of

164
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,800
constituents so that means the number of

165
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,600
particles of each kind and the Val of

166
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,160
the parameters that is all the like the

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,079
volume of the system or the other things

168
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,880
that describe uh

169
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,000
the external force or the things that

170
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,959
you can control from the external so you

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,519
fix

172
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:22,959
this then for each value of the

173
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,399
energy there is one and only one stable

174
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,959
equum state that is the statement uh

175
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,079
introduced by uh

176
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:37,200
I think by George atopos when he was uh

177
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:41,040
collaborating with Jo Kenan uh in the

178
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
60s uh in this

179
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,480
department and we'll talk about this the

180
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,480
second session in a

181
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:57,440
moment and we will see also um as we go

182
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,839
on that in fact there is no

183
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,519
contradiction as long as we

184
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,240
understand and and we convince ourselves

185
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,959
that thermodynamics considers a set of

186
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,480
states that is broader than the set of

187
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
States considered in mechanics So within

188
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,399
the set of mechanics there's only one

189
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,399
stable eum state which is the lowest

190
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:23,600
energy State for the given values of N

191
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:26,519
and beta uh but uh in the more broader

192
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,000
uh set considered by

193
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,240
thermodynamics there is one equum state

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,200
state mistake for

195
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,560
um every value of the

196
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,839
AG and these has consequences

197
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,120
important consquences that we will uh uh

198
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,120
uh

199
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,120
beuss

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:58,279
today yeah so one would uh ask well

201
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:01,160
why I mean we we already have statements

202
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:06,200
of the second law why do you accept this

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:11,360
other one well that's because it is more

204
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:14,720
General uh and it implies as cuses as

205
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:20,079
theorems the most famous statements of

206
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,839
the second law which are the Cy plank

207
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,959
statement called also a possibility of a

208
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,720
perpetual motion machine of the second

209
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,160
kind we this is the only thing we will

210
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,240
prove today uh in some I mean some

211
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,880
fashion because it's

212
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,160
easy is a direct consequence of the

213
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,760
first assertion of the second

214
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,760
law and later

215
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,800
on uh not

216
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,079
today uh probably next time uh we prove

217
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
the other statement of the second law

218
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,519
which is

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,079
Claus

220
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,600
statement the one that says that uh uh

221
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,959
heat does not go from uh from cold to

222
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,920
Haw from D Vice

223
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:07,000
vers that requires that we introduce

224
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,560
Define what we mean by heat what we mean

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,800
by temperature uh it

226
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,800
takes a while not long but another

227
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,279
lecture but the beauty of this

228
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,079
construction is that you you get to that

229
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,839
result as as a theorem of of uh combined

230
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,839
first and second

231
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,519
law there is also another important

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,160
statement by karate aing which is more

233
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:39,600
mathematical though which can also be

234
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,600
proved but we will not do it in this

235
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:48,680
course okay so what is the Perpetual so

236
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:51,560
now I want to talk about kin plank U say

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,320
what um is a perpetual motion machine of

238
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,320
the second

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:02,000
kind all right is any

240
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:05,320
device essentially a system in our uh

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,480
language that would start from a stable

242
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,199
equilibrium

243
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,360
State remember a state that cannot be

244
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,839
changed without uh leing some net

245
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
external

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,360
effects and and in another state a

247
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,360
different

248
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,160
state why in a weight process in which

249
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,399
uh the um the weight goes

250
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,720
so in which you have transferred some

251
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,760
energy out of your system and into

252
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,839
lifting the weight okay if you manage to

253
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,480
do that it's a perpetual motion machine

254
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,480
of the second

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,680
kind it's funny

256
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:57,079
because uh it has been very long since I

257
00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:00,279
have not received any um emils from

258
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:04,160
these uh crazy inventors

259
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:08,199
but perhaps because I I mentioned it or

260
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,759
maybe Google listens or maybe that's

261
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,360
because I'm at MIT but uh on Wednesday I

262
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,279
receive one I would be happy to show it

263
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,360
to you very fun somebody who wants to

264
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,800
put a container in the sea and it's yeah

265
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,959
it's a it's not even Perpetual machine

266
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,320
of second kind it's of the first kind I

267
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,880
would say and I think the guy needs to

268
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:36,040
learn some mechanics but

269
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:40,759
um in the old days it was a continuous

270
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,279
flow of applications for patents uh in

271
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,639
uh

272
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,519
violating this uh the impossibility of

273
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,920
the

274
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:55,120
same until in the 60s or the 70s I

275
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,399
forget the patent office uh uh US patent

276
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,680
office decided that anything that

277
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,519
violates uh uh the law of the or the

278
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,880
principle of this principle of

279
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:10,759
impossibility ofm to uh is rejected

280
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,800
immediately without going to uh

281
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,000
referee that's

282
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,360
because as I may have told you I forget

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,480
the last time but uh I remember when I

284
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,279
was a student with Professor gpos he

285
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,560
would uh be so well um um educated that

286
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,199
to uh reply

287
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,240
in written and in full length to any

288
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,880
letter that he would receive which is a

289
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:43,279
principle that I still have uh uh but he

290
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,680
would spend like 20 pages to explain

291
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,959
line by line why you wrong and what and

292
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,120
U often these crazy inventors make very

293
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:57,160
complicated uh and uh convoluted

294
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,800
reasoning that uh makes it very hard to

295
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,399
dismantle and uh and uh and reject but

296
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,319
he was doing that uh

297
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,079
consistently uh whether you whether it

298
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:12,079
was it was asked by the patent office or

299
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:15,120
by the inventor

300
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,759
direct fortunately we don't have that uh

301
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,880
sort of spam any longer so how do we

302
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:26,399
prove this well one way uh one simple

303
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,519
way is uh to prove it that if I if F

304
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,480
system can be divided into two parts so

305
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,240
let's uh

306
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,120
reason this so that we see also what

307
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:42,440
kind of proofs uh logical proofs

308
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,600
are we're talking about and it is

309
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,959
a a proof of ABS also that means we

310
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,360
assume that the emm2 is possible and

311
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,360
show that leads to a

312
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,560
contradiction so let's assume that our

313
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,880
system which can be divided in two parts

314
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,240
that an addition of assumtion can be

315
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,000
removed but it makes things more

316
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,280
complicated assume that it does ser from

317
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,839
a stable equilibrium State and it does

318
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,720
end in a different state

319
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,000
A1 with as external effect the lifting

320
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,160
of

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,199
way all right if that's true if that's

322
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,919
happened then you can take the energy of

323
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,840
the weight

324
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:32,679
back and use it to take one from the

325
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,400
system and accelerate into some veloc

326
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,039
give it in form of kinetic energy take

327
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,720
the potential energy of the wave and

328
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,320
give as kinetic energy of the second

329
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,320
part of the

330
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:50,440
system so what did we

331
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,679
achieve so look at this St and the initi

332
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,679
should

333
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:02,600
State why why is this not possible

334
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,120
because the final state is different

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:10,080
from the initial one and the initial

336
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,000
one was a stable equilibrium

337
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,799
State and there are no external effects

338
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,600
because the wave went up but then it

339
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,559
also we down so the net external effect

340
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,080
is zero yet we manage to start from a

341
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,840
stable State and change it to an

342
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,559
entirely to a different

343
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,559
set that contradicts

344
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:33,799
the definition of stable

345
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:39,440
equilibrium

346
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:42,480
okay all right so this is the proof of

347
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,480
plus of the

348
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,960
second now in order to go uh on the

349
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,760
second aspect of this second or second

350
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,960
assertion we we left behind one of the

351
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,360
definitions that are peculiar of

352
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,679
thermodynamics and it's the uh that of

353
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,600
reversible process what we mean by

354
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,600
reversible

355
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:12,320
process okay the definition is a solor

356
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,200
you you have a process first of all so

357
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,520
it means you have the initial and final

358
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,720
say and you have an external

359
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,559
effect B1 goes to

360
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,400
V2 the state of the environment changes

361
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,760
so

362
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,960
much okay the process is we call it

363
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,720
reversible if it is possible not

364
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:39,280
necessarily retracing back uh backwards

365
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:43,520
exactly the same forward path of your

366
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:47,440
initial uh process but in any other way

367
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,840
if you find a way to bring the state of

368
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,840
your system back to its

369
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,120
initial and also the stake of the

370
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,440
environment back to its initial

371
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,000
State then and only then we call the

372
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,760
process

373
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,760
reversible okay so that means you have

374
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,320
to try have all possibilities this a

375
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,080
very

376
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:20,159
abstract definition but it's also very

377
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:24,120
precise so I usually I'm not going to do

378
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,280
it because the I want to make dust but I

379
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,679
usually take a piece of chalk and throw

380
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:34,159
it to the wall it breaks and asked

381
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:38,200
you is that process was that process

382
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,200
reversible or not what would you

383
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,480
say it's

384
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,480
not

385
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
fine

386
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,799
but how did you decide I know it's

387
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,840
in I mean I'm making something that

388
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,600
might sound wa SAR about all that other

389
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,600
dis better you can G back

390
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,799
that good okay so you use your physical

391
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,159
intuition that's because that's because

392
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:19,360
you have a background youve already see

393
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,880
the idea of reversibility and

394
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,840
irreversibility but in our game if you

395
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
accept the rules of our

396
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,320
game

397
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,279
uh what should you have done to to

398
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,440
decide you should have tried to

399
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,640
reconstruct the state of the piece of

400
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Choke to see if it is possible to place

401
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,360
that and then also whatever it did to

402
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,279
the environment must be

403
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,880
undone and you have to try all possible

404
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:53,279
ways so how could you be so quick in

405
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:56,880
answering okay it's a correct answer but

406
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,720
uh you didn't apply our rules this is to

407
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,760
just uh underline this is a very

408
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,559
abstract concept and impossible in

409
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,960
practice it doesn't correspond to a a

410
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:11,000
procedure so that you can verify if a

411
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,200
process irreversible or not but it's a

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,840
con and soon we will find a a method and

413
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,279
of course as soon as we have defined

414
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:24,320
atopy that will be the method to compute

415
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:27,760
to calculate entropy measure entropy and

416
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,559
see how it changes and from that from

417
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,400
the entropy the balance equation we can

418
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,360
decide whether a process is symol or not

419
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:40,440
so we develop a practical method to uh

420
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,600
measure this very abstract uh

421
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,559
concept so why is uh uh reversible the

422
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,240
concept of reversible process important

423
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:53,799
in the second law because uh the second

424
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,240
statement uh second assertion it

425
00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:00,240
says you start from any state of your

426
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,240
system

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,600
and you you can always

428
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:12,320
go to a stable equilibrium

429
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:16,279
state to bring your system from that

430
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:20,520
state to a stable equilibrium

431
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:24,039
State and in a wave

432
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,039
process which is

433
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,679
reversed so it's lot L all our concept

434
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,240
together that's why we find them before

435
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,080
uh now we put them all the all together

436
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,120
there but if you go slowly and you

437
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,240
Mumble about it uh um that's what it

438
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,640
says uh redefine all the terms start

439
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:52,520
from initial State you can always uh get

440
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:57,840
your system to a saying say uh maybe so

441
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,840
way processed a reversible way processed

442
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,600
okay now it turns

443
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,919
out that if you try other

444
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,000
ways

445
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,000
to change your state to a stable

446
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,440
equilibrium

447
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,440
State other ways that are not

448
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:35,440
reversible you would uh lift the weight

449
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,440
less than when it is

450
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:43,919
reversal so that means this is a

451
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:47,720
theor and uh uh yeah it's proved in the

452
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,279
the usual book and uh the theorem says

453
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,320
that the

454
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,360
maximum uh lift that you can give to a

455
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,880
weight in a weight

456
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,480
process with your system starting in any

457
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,240
state is

458
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,000
obtain when your system ends in a stable

459
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,240
equilibrium State and when the process

460
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,240
is

461
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,240
reversing and that final stable

462
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,919
equilibrium

463
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:23,679
state is uniquely fixed by your initial

464
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,799
state only one stable equilibrium state

465
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,840
that can be reached in a reversible

466
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,840
weight process uh uh from State

467
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,399
A1 so this is enough to say that the

468
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,840
amount of energy that you transferred to

469
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:44,960
the weight in these conditions is a

470
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,120
property depends only on state A1 so

471
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,120
that is only on time

472
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:58,480
T1 because the final state is a function

473
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,399
of A1 so it po defend on T1

474
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,320
on the state

475
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:07,600
at1 and we call this property atic

476
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,600
availability of the system in state

477
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,919
A1 it's the

478
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,760
maximal I don't want to call it but we

479
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,799
could also call it work because

480
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,720
eventually that's a work interaction so

481
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,000
it's a maximum work you can extract from

482
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,000
your

483
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,320
system in the given state

484
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,159
and if you are an

485
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:39,279
engineer and you're trying

486
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:41,039
to make devices to uh exploit

487
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:46,880
um

488
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:51,200
um natural resources like uh

489
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,039
energy resources like coal natural gas

490
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,960
uh nuclear whatever

491
00:26:54,039 --> 00:27:01,360
solar you you the main question that

492
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,200
then Dynamics was set for 200 years ago

493
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,240
by carau is well what's the most I can

494
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,159
do out of this

495
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,559
situation and diabetic

496
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,559
availability is an

497
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,240
answer of course it gives an answer

498
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,960
under certain conditions you change the

499
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,919
conditions you get different answers as

500
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,840
we will see we will have more

501
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,799
availabilities it depends on the

502
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,600
condition here the condition is in a

503
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,679
wave process so if I have my system and

504
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,480
I confine myself to just a wave

505
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,919
process that's the amount of the maximum

506
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,559
amount of energy I can extract from my

507
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,679
system the most I can do out of

508
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:54,000
it if it weren't for

509
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:55,480
um an important uh uh detail uh we we

510
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,039
would be satisfied that thetic

511
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,519
availability is all that we need in

512
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,880
order to describe our engineering

513
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,640
applications the detail is that this

514
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,760
property is not

515
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,399
additive and therefore it's not very

516
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,720
practical

517
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:16,000
because um when you

518
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,360
have a a system made out of two

519
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,159
subsystems and you measure the availab

520
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,080
the adamatic availability of system a

521
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,399
and then the adamatic availability of

522
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,919
system B uh well if you want to consider

523
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:31,480
the combin system you have to make

524
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,760
another measurement to measure the

525
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:39,279
adamatic availability of the system

526
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:41,159
C the the the simplest example that I

527
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,960
can think of as suppose you have a glass

528
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,120
of

529
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:50,440
water which is H

530
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,440
hot and a glass of water which is uh

531
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,399
cold so you measure thetic availability

532
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,200
of this

533
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:00,159
one and if it is hot but in a stable

534
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,919
equilibrium

535
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,600
State how much is thetic

536
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,760
availability it's zero because otherwise

537
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,720
it would be a

538
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,080
pmn2

539
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,360
no I mean if you could uh if you started

540
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,039
from a sa equum State you cannot leave

541
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:22,720
the we so a system in a sa equum state

542
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,880
is zero diabatic availability so the

543
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:31,360
thetic availability of uh we use a

544
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:35,240
letter s so of uh this glass of water is

545
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,120
zero P of that glass of water is

546
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,679
zero but if I

547
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,559
consider the composite system of course

548
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,640
we all know

549
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,679
that for example with a Carno

550
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,320
engine you can extract work out of this

551
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,880
situation so you see that 0 plus 0 uh

552
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:02,120
does not make number different from Z so

553
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,720
we lack additivity of this proper and

554
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:10,480
this is why it takes uh the next half

555
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,120
hour to build up um another property it

556
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,600
will be

557
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,600
entropy which will contain features so

558
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,039
that we can compute the TIC availability

559
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:27,360
and it will be addied we have to build

560
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,360
additivity on around atic availability

561
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,600
there is

562
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,440
also this other

563
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:43,960
theorem that I'm not proving but I'm

564
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:49,600
pointing you at this U proof uh it's on

565
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:52,399
page 76 of of the book um again so since

566
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,360
I'm not doing it I'm not uh

567
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:59,639
uh asking that you study it but uh if

568
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,320
you're curious just go and

569
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:03,519
look

570
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,360
and it

571
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,600
says that if you consider a weight

572
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,039
process so now we confine ourselves to a

573
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,840
weight

574
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,840
process between any two

575
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,519
SES

576
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:24,440
okay so

577
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:26,120
um clearly if you since our thetic

578
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,240
availability is a property now you can

579
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,679
measure it for sayate any1

580
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,720
you could also measure it for State

581
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,159
A2 like uh energy the property so you

582
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,559
can measure it for A1 you can me it for

583
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,919
A2 so you give me two states of system

584
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:49,600
a and I can measure for each s its

585
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,600
energy and its arotic

586
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,519
availability so it turns out that this

587
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:00,760
theorem says that if uh

588
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,600
you have a a necessary and sufficient

589
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,639
condition

590
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,440
for the process to be

591
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:09,559
reversed

592
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,159
if the difference between energy and

593
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:15,559
arotic availability so you could

594
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,559
interpret that as the energy that is not

595
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,559
adiabatically

596
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,960
available at the

597
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:29,080
end is equal to the energy not

598
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,080
adiabatically available at the beginning

599
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:41,320
so uh in a reversible process the energy

600
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,320
not diabatically available is

601
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,960
concerned

602
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:51,200
whereas in an irreversible

603
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,200
process it

604
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:56,480
increases very similar in fact also

605
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,240
entropy will play the same will will

606
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,559
will play in a similar way

607
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:07,279
so this uh energy not adiabatically

608
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:10,919
available is a weakness of

609
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,120
uh reversibility it's the basis for uh

610
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,720
measuring uh in practice whether a

611
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,399
process isible or not all you need to do

612
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,919
is according to if you trust this

613
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:23,840
theorem is measure energy measure

614
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,480
adiabatic availability with the tools we

615
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,320
developed and then check this

616
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,679
inequality if you is an equality the

617
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,760
process is reversible the reverse sorry

618
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,159
the weight processing is reversible if

619
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,159
it is uh an

620
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,679
inequality uh like like this one the

621
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,679
process is

622
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,159
irreversible if it's the other way

623
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,919
around it's impossible it may something

624
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,480
wrong so it is

625
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,240
impossible to

626
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,519
decrease uh the amount of energy that is

627
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,519
not at vacally

628
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,519
um

629
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,320
a okay so this is a precursor of the

630
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,200
principle that we will call of entropy

631
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,040
non decree we could call it the

632
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:19,839
principle of non decrees of the energy

633
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,839
nonat thetically non

634
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:28,879
available of okay so now

635
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,440
we try to

636
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,079
make or build up this

637
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,919
property that has

638
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:42,040
um that builds a additivity

639
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:45,679
into diotic availability so we are

640
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,679
heading towards a

641
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:55,240
eight in order to do that we introduce

642
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:57,760
some other Concepts the first one is the

643
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,880
concept of mutual stable equum for

644
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,599
Mutual

645
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,599
equilibrium between two

646
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,119
systems so two systems are in mutual

647
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,599
equilibrium like the hot and

648
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,640
cold they these are not a mutual

649
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,200
equilibrium

650
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:21,320
because because the composite

651
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,160
system is not in a stable equili State

652
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,839
the fact that it has diabetic

653
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,720
availability because that's an if and

654
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:29,400
only if theorem so the fact that it has

655
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,040
nonzero diabatic

656
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,960
availability uh is equivalent to not

657
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,960
mean a stable equum

658
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,119
state so these

659
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:46,599
two they are individually in stable

660
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,880
equilibrium but the composite is not in

661
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,880
a stable equilibrium state so they are

662
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,119
not in mutual stable

663
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,920
equilibrium in another situation in

664
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,760
which

665
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,280
instead they are individually and also

666
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,040
the composite system has zero diabetic

667
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,520
availability so that means the

668
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,520
um the uh the composite is in stable

669
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,960
equilibrium then you say that the uh two

670
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,880
systems are in mutual equilibrium that's

671
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,839
the

672
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,200
concept the other

673
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:26,040
concept is that of thermal

674
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:30,720
Reservoir a thermal Reservoir is a

675
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:33,720
particular system I would uh say a

676
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,720
limiting

677
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,680
system there has this feature that I

678
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,440
will describe with a practical system

679
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,960
making any

680
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,560
L you take the substance like water in a

681
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,839
fixed volume

682
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,680
container and you

683
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,920
produce

684
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,520
uh a Poss a combination that we call

685
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,560
triple point so a situation in which you

686
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,240
have the

687
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,400
coexistence in stable

688
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,920
equilibrium of ice liquid water and

689
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,160
water

690
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,440
vapor right here ice liquid water and

691
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,440
water

692
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,440
VAP

693
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,160
okay then you find another

694
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,280
system let's call it

695
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,960
C that is in neutal equilibrium with it

696
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,400
for for example it could be another copy

697
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,640
of another uh piece of water at the

698
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,599
triple

699
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,640
point but not

700
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,880
necessarily the important thing that

701
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:48,680
defines a reservoir a thermal Reservoir

702
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,680
is that if you uh change the

703
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,319
energy of this particular system for

704
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,800
example I I consider a state with more

705
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:03,720
energy so it will have lesser

706
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,480
eyes uh maybe a little more water or or

707
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,440
less liing water in any case so the

708
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,280
proportions of the three phases

709
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:18,040
change so the these are two different

710
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,040
stes with different energies

711
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:26,440
but they are both in neutral equilibrium

712
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,440
with this systen C

713
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,800
all why did I choose triple point water

714
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:42,160
that's because H it

715
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:42,160
is easy to prepare in any uh

716
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,400
blood and as you

717
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,000
know we haven't defined yet what the

718
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,359
temperature is in a moment we'll do

719
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,040
it but just because you know what

720
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:01,560
temperature is uh uh triple point uh

721
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,400
is at a low pressure

722
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,280
like6

723
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,560
kilopascal and at a temperature of

724
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,240
273.16 so it's

725
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,240
.01

726
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
celsus

727
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,000
okay so now that we have the

728
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,160
reservoir we apply again the second

729
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,040
assertion of the second

730
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,839
law which says we can always start from

731
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,800
a system in any

732
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,119
state and

733
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,040
reach a stable equilibrium state in a

734
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,839
reversible way

735
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:50,680
process this is an important load

736
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,920
statement that it it it allows it I mean

737
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,079
how do I know that it always

738
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,480
exists okay it's very

739
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,839
abstract but is very similar to the

740
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,839
statement that says in the first law the

741
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,599
second assertion that says yeah you can

742
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:09,000
always interconnect the two weight

743
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,800
process that in the two states by mean a

744
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,520
weight process but uh uh no matter what

745
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
weight process you choose it's always

746
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,640
the same energy that you transfer out to

747
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,560
the weight how do you know that by

748
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,800
because I can invent uh many different

749
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,040
ways to to to do their job and how how

750
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,599
do I know that they will all get the

751
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,760
same outcome okay that also is a very

752
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,240
abstract idea but it works because

753
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,319
energy as after all has been very

754
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,560
successful in describing stuff in in

755
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,560
physics and we believe that it so much

756
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,960
to be one of those great conservation

757
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,480
principle that we talked about last time

758
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,319
and here is the same thing we have a

759
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,319
very abstract idea about the existence

760
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,920
of something it guarantees that now we

761
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,319
Define a measurement procedure based on

762
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:04,920
this if we didn't have this statement we

763
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:08,720
couldn't uh um trust our measurement

764
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,720
procedure and the measurement

765
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:18,319
procedure is based on this ingredient

766
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:23,880
which I repeat uh here um with a little

767
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:27,000
more detail so I take a system and the

768
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,480
resare and they are some initial States

769
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,200
a one and in the r

770
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,480
one the res starts in a stable

771
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,839
equilibrium State like water at the

772
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,839
triple

773
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,800
point then I do a reverse Symon weight

774
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,319
process for this combination for this

775
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,240
combined system composite

776
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:57,839
system uh which has is only a teral

777
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:00,520
effect the lifting of the weight

778
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,920
and it's maximal lifting because uh the

779
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,000
process is

780
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,280
revers because it's the weight process

781
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,040
is revers so that's the maximum we are

782
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,240
applying essentially the theorem of

783
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,119
adiabatic availability here but to the

784
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,800
composite

785
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:20,720
system

786
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:23,720
uh a uh n r all right if this L thing is

787
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
uh

788
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,640
Massimo and

789
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,680
I think I jumped a little bit but maybe

790
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,760
I I I could I could say that if the F if

791
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,359
the finance say order to apply the

792
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,200
theorem of adiabatic

793
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:44,520
availability the final state would have

794
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,960
to be a stable equilibrium say for the

795
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,640
for the composite system

796
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,599
now and by our definition of mutual

797
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,720
equilibrium it would mean that uh since

798
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,960
the composite is in stable equilibrium

799
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,960
the two parts are in mutual equilibrium

800
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,359
so it means that the final in the final

801
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,440
State

802
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,440
A2 the system a is

803
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,319
in here I want to do it a little more

804
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,319
General and

805
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,160
uh you see I'm applying that theorem

806
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:31,640
twice because I'm going you know in

807
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,640
order to go from A1 to

808
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:43,720
A2 I could uh in which uh my reservoir

809
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,720
is an R1 and here is an R uh

810
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,960
two so now I

811
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:55,559
do consider the

812
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,559
composite of the two systems

813
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:03,640
uh the theorem of adiabatic availability

814
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:06,520
says that uh if I

815
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:14,400
go let's say

816
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:16,040
R let's call it R um r r okay so if I go

817
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,880
from here to here and this one is a

818
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,800
stable equilibrium State for the

819
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,200
composite then I have extracted as much

820
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,480
as I

821
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,040
could uh also I can do it starting from

822
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,040
state two

823
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,839
so here I would extract the adiabatic

824
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,319
availability let's call it c one one of

825
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:42,400
system of the composite system

826
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:45,920
a and here I would have

827
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,800
extracted the adiabatic availability of

828
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,040
this uh of the system uh in this other

829
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,040
state to

830
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,040
to

831
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,800
okayy but since in doing this extraction

832
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,240
I'm using reversible weight

833
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,319
processes I can

834
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:12,920
also

835
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:12,920
um reverse the arrow so I can go this

836
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,440
way and of course I

837
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:22,839
undo the effect on the

838
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,559
weight so as I go from here I so that

839
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:28,240
means I can go from here to there by

840
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:30,119
means of that reversing we process and

841
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,240
the amount of energy I transfer to the

842
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,240
weight is uh s 1 minus S

843
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,559
2

844
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,800
okay however in this the ingredient uh

845
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,319
yes so we we know how much energy we

846
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:51,040
transfer to the weight in that process

847
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:53,440
on on the on the

848
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,880
slide but for the measurement procedures

849
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:01,640
that we are going to introduce in a

850
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,640
moment uh was was um important is

851
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:08,480
uh the changing energy of the

852
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,160
res how much did the energy of the

853
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,160
reservoir change during this

854
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,680
process because that's something that we

855
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,240
can measure so measure you do that

856
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,240
process you give me

857
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:29,000
a uh choosing two states A1 and A2 the

858
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,720
second low guarantee is that you can do

859
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,720
this process with any

860
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,319
Reservoir and then once you've done it

861
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,559
you can measure energy because you we

862
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,880
Define property energy and so measure it

863
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,880
for the reservoir and make the

864
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,280
difference of the final energy of the

865
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,400
reservoir and its initial

866
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,480
energy now this Syle here is complicated

867
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,400
because

868
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,160
uh uh no because I want to

869
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,559
emphasize

870
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,760
that yes we are measuring an energy

871
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:09,400
difference for a for the

872
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,720
reservoir but it's more than that it you

873
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,319
we have to do it in those particular

874
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,040
conditions so it it says that system a

875
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,359
starts like this and so on that the

876
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:24,920
process is a weight process and that uh

877
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,800
it is reg you do it under under other

878
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,720
conditions it's another St okay all

879
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,319
right

880
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,319
so this is the

881
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,160
ingredient okay with that

882
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,599
ingredient here is the measurement

883
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:45,319
procedure that defines a property that

884
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,319
we will call um temperature of the

885
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,480
res and that will turn out to be a uh

886
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,960
the constant for the given resware so

887
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,480
equal for all of it uh stable

888
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,480
equilibrium

889
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,400
States we already know for we already

890
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,520
know that for U for the triple point

891
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,520
water it's

892
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:16,160
2736 K or

893
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,760
0.01

894
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,520
Celsius

895
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,400
and if

896
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,559
after it

897
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,160
is for as long as you in the Box you

898
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,400
have all three phases you can you can

899
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,720
put in energy take the energy out and so

900
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:38,359
on as long as um you have at least some

901
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,040
ice some water and some water vapor um

902
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:43,200
that temperature doesn't

903
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:46,040
change so it's equal for all the states

904
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,839
of that

905
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,400
system okay but how do we measure it

906
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,799
okay so now for this meas measurement

907
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,960
procedure the object of measurement is

908
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:59,880
the res you come to my lab with you

909
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,720
Reservoir and I am supposed to

910
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,119
measure this property for your reservo

911
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,119
so here's

912
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,119
the

913
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,839
object in order to do the measurement I

914
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,520
take an auxiliary

915
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:20,799
system so I choose whatever system I

916
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,880
want and any arbitrary two states for

917
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:25,559
that

918
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,440
system and I

919
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,799
do my my reversible weight

920
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,079
process for the

921
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:40,119
combination that will list the weight by

922
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:44,480
somehow some some El and I measure how

923
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:47,440
much your changes in energy and I put

924
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,440
that in the

925
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,720
numerator in the

926
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:55,280
denominator I put the result of the

927
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,520
similar measurement that I have done

928
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,319
once and for all

929
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:05,200
for a reference Reservoir we I happen to

930
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:05,200
like to choose the triple point

931
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,799
water of

932
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,920
course when I did this measurement I use

933
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:15,799
the same system a and the same two

934
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,520
states A1 and

935
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:21,599
A2

936
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:25,119
okay and I measured how much energy

937
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:28,400
changes the this res were reference res

938
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:32,599
and I take this

939
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:35,720
so this ratio is a measurement by

940
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:43,160
comparison it's exactly like when you

941
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:47,640
say well uh uh how long is this uh thing

942
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:50,359
okay you compare it with the meter or

943
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:54,200
the inch uh okay and the meter is

944
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:56,760
another object U that is maybe in some

945
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,760
Museum in Paris but and you see how how

946
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,400
many times this thing stays so take the

947
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,559
ratio of the this length to the length

948
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:08,319
of the meter you get a dimensionless

949
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:11,040
number it's exactly like here it'sing

950
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,559
this L there and as you know when you

951
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,359
have measurements like that you can

952
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:21,040
introduce a unit of measure you call the

953
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:23,920
meter one meter but you could have

954
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,839
called it uh

955
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:30,240
uh I don't know how many

956
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,000
each is s a meter but you could call it

957
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,920
like

958
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,920
40 something uh

959
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,400
H

960
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,799
okay it

961
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,680
say we take the

962
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:54,200
ratio we

963
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:57,799
multiply we take this unit not

964
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,640
one Gibbs or one at what we call it

965
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:03,799
since Kelvin was the first we call it uh

966
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:08,319
and he didn't put one but he put

967
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:10,240
273.16 all right so that's our uh basis

968
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,240
but we put here this

969
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,440
number and the

970
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,240
result so you multiply by that number

971
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:24,799
this dimensionless ratio and you

972
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,799
get this property temperature in Kelvin

973
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:36,000
of course there is a an important

974
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:39,200
theorem again proved there that uh says

975
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,040
first of all that this ratio is

976
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,400
positive that it is

977
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,400
independent of the initial states of the

978
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,960
reservoirs that it is

979
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:55,119
independent of your choice of auxiliary

980
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,119
system and once you've chosen that

981
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:02,799
system independent of the initial and

982
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:02,799
final a States A1 and A2 of that

983
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:12,680
system and also that it is equal for all

984
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:15,480
states stable equum states of the of the

985
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,839
res so that is a

986
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,839
property add a constant volume we call

987
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:23,119
it the temperature of the res notice we

988
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:26,520
Define just the temperature of a res we

989
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,559
haven't defined yet the temperature of a

990
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,480
stable equili state of the general

991
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,480
system not

992
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
yet but this is enough for our

993
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:45,160
purposes also notice that the by the way

994
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,319
we Define the property to this formula

995
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:51,359
you can rewrite that formula by taking

996
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:55,119
the things with the subst r on the left

997
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:57,799
uh hand side and subst R zero on the

998
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,400
right hand side you get

999
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:02,880
this

1000
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,880
uh other

1001
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:15,000
equality from this equality you can

1002
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,000
infer what that uh if I measure this

1003
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,480
ratio for Reservoir R it's the same as

1004
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,160
for the reference Reservoir it's the

1005
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,160
same for all

1006
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,520
reservoirs so it's independent of the

1007
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,559
res

1008
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,680
so this ratio although we use the

1009
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:37,040
reservoir to measure it is independent

1010
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,480
of the res so what does it depend on it

1011
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,160
depends only on the system a the

1012
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,040
auxiliary system that you have used and

1013
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,880
the two

1014
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:49,880
states this is why this is very

1015
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,960
important because essentially this leads

1016
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,920
us to the

1017
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,000
definition of

1018
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,720
entropy that ration

1019
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,920
we call it the entropy

1020
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:08,640
difference between two states A1 and

1021
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,640
A2 of our

1022
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,280
system if you want to put it in another

1023
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,559
way what's the measurement procedure for

1024
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,839
entropy okay so now you come to my lab

1025
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:25,000
and uh bring your system and bring the

1026
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:27,480
system in a given State on which you're

1027
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,400
interested in measuring the

1028
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,720
entropy again I tell you look I just can

1029
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:38,280
measure entropy differences so it

1030
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:41,200
pick reference uh State a zero Give It

1031
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,880
Whatever value you want for the enthropy

1032
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,880
of that one I measure only the

1033
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:50,720
difference and how do I measure the

1034
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:54,839
difference well I

1035
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:58,240
run I find a reversible wave

1036
00:55:54,839 --> 00:56:01,119
process for your

1037
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,319
system and my Reser for example I could

1038
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,319
choose water at the triple

1039
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,920
point but not

1040
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:13,599
necessarily and

1041
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,960
measure the energy change of the res

1042
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,640
using this

1043
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:22,119
process and put it at the

1044
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:24,039
numerator in the denominator I put the

1045
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:27,280
temperature of the reservoir that I have

1046
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:29,480
previously measured with that other

1047
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,079
measurement

1048
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:36,680
procedure and this ratio we just proved

1049
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:39,039
is independent of the res I I chose

1050
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,319
here so I

1051
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,000
add this ratio

1052
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:46,039
to so this ratio essentially is the

1053
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,799
answer that's difference in

1054
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:49,799
entropy between these two

1055
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,720
states all right so we have an explicit

1056
00:56:55,319 --> 00:57:02,480
uh measurement

1057
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:06,640
procedure that gives us

1058
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,520
anything and the advantage of this

1059
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,200
property with respect to diabatic

1060
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,200
availability is that it is

1061
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:19,920
UND you do it for a system a you do it

1062
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:23,720
for a system

1063
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:27,079
B and then you do it for a system

1064
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,200
composite AB where the the entropy is

1065
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,520
the

1066
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,520
same entropy differences are

1067
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:44,640
added in a moment we will see also

1068
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:48,079
um a practical engineering meaning of of

1069
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:52,160
ENT but let me also

1070
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:55,799
Define this other property which we

1071
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,559
essentially already did here when you

1072
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:59,839
have a system in combination with a

1073
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:02,760
reservoir like here system and a

1074
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:05,880
reservoir they start in some initial

1075
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,160
States the Reser in a stable equilibrium

1076
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,799
State system a in any state of the

1077
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,799
equilibrium on equilibrium doesn't

1078
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:17,520
matter I can apply the theorem of

1079
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,119
adiabatic availability to the composite

1080
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:26,920
system and find that the

1081
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:29,039
maximum uh weight list that I can obtain

1082
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,359
from this composite system in those

1083
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:35,480
initial

1084
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:37,559
States uh is thetic availability is uh

1085
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,000
is obtained when

1086
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:43,440
we make the reversible Pro the weight

1087
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,440
process

1088
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,400
reverse and it

1089
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,839
also ends in a stable equilibrium for

1090
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,160
the composite system so when the two

1091
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:01,400
when a are are in mutual te

1092
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:05,640
so here system a ends in a state that I

1093
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:08,760
call a subr just uh to remind us that it

1094
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:11,920
is the state in which system a is in

1095
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,920
mutual equili with the

1096
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:20,240
res and the final state of the uh

1097
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,720
Reservoir is also

1098
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:27,319
uniquely fixed by the initial states of

1099
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,319
a and r

1100
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:35,119
okay this is a new property you can view

1101
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:37,599
it if you fix the reservoir or with

1102
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,599
respect to a given Reservoir this is

1103
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,599
another property for

1104
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:48,640
system it is another availability

1105
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:51,680
another U maximum worth in other

1106
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:55,440
conditions when the system can also

1107
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,039
interact or as an a reservoir available

1108
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,440
with which to

1109
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:05,000
interact we call it available energy

1110
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,000
with respect to the reservoir

1111
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:13,640
R we can make uh so so we call Omega

1112
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:14,839
Omega is the energy that goes through

1113
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,240
the

1114
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:22,119
weight we can make you can write an

1115
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:24,200
energy balance for that uh

1116
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,280
process because now we know how to

1117
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,559
compute the energy so we can compute the

1118
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,559
energy

1119
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:32,359
difference for system

1120
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:35,960
a it

1121
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:40,000
goes uh from A1 to a

1122
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:43,280
r so the the energy that goes out of

1123
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,079
system a is E1 minus

1124
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:52,440
E the energy that goes out of the

1125
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:55,720
reservoir is e the energy of R State

1126
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,920
S1 minus the energy of R in this fin

1127
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,920
state

1128
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,400
and since any is conserved these are the

1129
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:12,280
things that go out they they sum up to

1130
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:14,319
what uh uh is received by the weight so

1131
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,760
this is

1132
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:22,000
theb but now if you remember how we we

1133
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,440
defined the the entropy of syst a just

1134
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,440
previous SL

1135
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,280
it's the

1136
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:32,680
ratio of the energy change of the

1137
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,480
reservoir so it's this

1138
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:38,359
Bunch the change is actually final minus

1139
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,839
initial so it's minus this much divided

1140
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:45,319
by the temperature so that's the eny so

1141
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:49,680
this ratio Which con could substitute

1142
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:52,720
this part using this equation and make

1143
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,240
an expression for the available energy a

1144
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,160
terms of the in

1145
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,160
I to see

1146
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,240
the the algebra

1147
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:09,000
here so this is the working uh equation

1148
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,000
for U Computing available energy of a

1149
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,960
given

1150
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,400
system all you need to to know available

1151
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,359
energy with respect to to the reservo r

1152
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,799
you need to know the initial energy the

1153
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:27,599
final the initial entropy E1 and S1 you

1154
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:29,920
need to know

1155
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:33,440
the energy and that the entropy that the

1156
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,559
system has once it gets into mutual the

1157
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,799
reservoir and you need to know the

1158
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:41,400
temperature of that

1159
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,400
res and this is a

1160
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,839
combination if you uh we call it

1161
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,960
available energy respect the ter

1162
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:54,079
reservoir

1163
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:57,319
uh later on when we give it say a few

1164
01:02:54,079 --> 01:03:01,599
words about ARG I this one form of

1165
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:04,240
ex ex is a war that was invented in the

1166
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:08,000
70s so maybe

1167
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:11,000
uh uh earlier Kenan called it

1168
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
availability in 1941 so this concept is

1169
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,079
around for been a while around for a

1170
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,480
while U but

1171
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:26,279
exergy the X means like it's like the

1172
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:26,279
essential part of of energy because

1173
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,119
exergy is the answer to the question

1174
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,119
what's the maximum I can do for from a

1175
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,200
given situation so there are many

1176
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,520
exergies and we already have seen a

1177
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,799
couple a diabatic availability is an

1178
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,760
energy that applies when the system

1179
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:45,880
under goes just a weight

1180
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,960
process uh here we have available energy

1181
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:51,880
it's another energy that applies when a

1182
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:54,039
system uh also is available a uh a

1183
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,079
reservoir it is the combination of the

1184
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,240
system and the the reservoir with I'm

1185
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,119
going to go away

1186
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:05,440
first so this is the formula so let's

1187
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:09,799
play again here let's play a bit with

1188
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:12,599
the formula and rewrite it in this way

1189
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:15,119
putting in evidence the entropy of State

1190
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,119
one of the

1191
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:26,359
system yeah before I before I do that

1192
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,079
notice that um

1193
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:33,359
except for the temperature on the

1194
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:37,039
res this formula doesn't have any other

1195
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:39,279
um properties s so doesn't have the the

1196
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,119
difference

1197
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:45,000
in has disappear because we wrote that

1198
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:46,839
in terms of the entropy change for the

1199
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,440
for the

1200
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:53,520
system okay so we put in evidence the

1201
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,520
entrop of system a state

1202
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:57,640
A1 any we notice

1203
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:06,440
that except for some things that are

1204
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:10,079
constant fixed

1205
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,079
by The Chosen

1206
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:17,240
Reservoir the entropy is

1207
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,880
proportional to the difference between

1208
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:26,119
energy and available energy so again it

1209
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:26,119
is the energy that is not available

1210
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,960
with respect to the

1211
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:33,720
res divided by the temperature of the

1212
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,079
res so the entropy is proportional to

1213
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:40,640
the proportional to the non available

1214
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:40,640
ener with respect

1215
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:51,640
to so the higher the entropy the lesser

1216
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,240
the energy that can be transformed to uh

1217
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:59,559
lifting a away which is the Prototype of

1218
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,559
a useful effect mechanical

1219
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:08,920
effect so that's why I C engineering me

1220
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:12,640
of lot of mechanical engineering Energy

1221
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:14,960
Engineering is related to trying to

1222
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,760
exploit as much as possible the

1223
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:24,559
availability of systems in other words

1224
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:29,920
to uh um an entropy Place

1225
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:34,359
against let entropy increased you lose

1226
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:38,760
ability to do useful effects so that's

1227
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:41,559
why in engineering we have to working at

1228
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:46,359
trying to improve the efficiency of

1229
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:49,200
stuff of machinery and so on uh with the

1230
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:49,200
purpose of

1231
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:56,440
reducing the spontaneous generation of

1232
01:06:54,119 --> 01:07:01,000
an because that will

1233
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,000
kill the available

1234
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:11,359
energy okay uh we said already said that

1235
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:13,880
thop is additive and it can be proved

1236
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:17,359
that is

1237
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,359
additive and

1238
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:23,400
uh the the theum on the criteria for

1239
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,319
reversibility we already see the first

1240
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:31,520
line here expressed in terms of thetic

1241
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:34,480
availability of the system you can

1242
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:38,039
express the saying that theorem uh

1243
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,400
translates also for uh available

1244
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:42,599
energy so

1245
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,520
the the difference between energy and

1246
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:48,880
available energy in respect to any

1247
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:52,359
Reservoir any given reservoir uh remains

1248
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,960
constant in a reversible process so the

1249
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:56,039
unavailable energy remains constant in a

1250
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,079
reversible

1251
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,799
process while it increases in an

1252
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:05,279
irreversible

1253
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:05,279
process and it cannot

1254
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,640
decrease and since we just saw that this

1255
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:14,880
these are available energies

1256
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:17,640
proportional to to uh the entropy we can

1257
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,640
write this

1258
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:22,839
as s

1259
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,040
remains

1260
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:31,440
constant in a reversible way

1261
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:35,480
process energy I'm sorry entropy

1262
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,480
increases if the process is

1263
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:43,319
everal entropy cannot decrease in a

1264
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,319
weight

1265
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,960
process but careful here about the

1266
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,839
conditions that we make this statement

1267
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:55,480
in uh

1268
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:59,239
because it would be wrong to say ah

1269
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:59,239
energy I mean the entropy cannot

1270
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:06,480
increase the entropy decreases all the

1271
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:09,120
times whenever you take a can of Coke

1272
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:12,040
and put it in your refrigerator the

1273
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,560
entropy of that kind of coke decreases

1274
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:17,799
because you're cooling it down that is

1275
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:20,520
not a weight process what we're saying

1276
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:22,600
here that the entropy cannot decrease in

1277
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,400
a wave process if the only external

1278
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:29,279
effect is only uh the

1279
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:33,120
changing I mean the lifting or or

1280
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:36,120
lowering of the of the weight then you

1281
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,600
cannot decrease the

1282
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,600
anop but you can decrease the anop of

1283
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,600
your system by simply taking making it

1284
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:49,480
flow out on your system because

1285
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,480
entropy is actually uh

1286
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:57,600
transferable we prove that in the same

1287
01:09:54,520 --> 01:10:00,640
way as we for the transferability or

1288
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:05,199
exchangeability of energy consider a

1289
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:08,760
composite system you apply uh

1290
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:11,520
um if I do it for a reversible processor

1291
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:15,920
then enthropy remains constant so it's a

1292
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:18,679
con principle entropy conservation in a

1293
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,640
weight a reversible wave

1294
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:25,840
process you combine it with additivity

1295
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:27,440
you find that uh the entropy

1296
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,600
cannot

1297
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,280
disappear if it goes out of system a it

1298
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,400
means that you find it somewhere else in

1299
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:37,360
system

1300
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:42,080
b in a reversible wave

1301
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:45,120
process so in the same way as we uh

1302
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,000
decided to give a symbol to this amount

1303
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,080
of entropy that is transferred from one

1304
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,080
system to the other we use a symbol that

1305
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:55,080
a simil so s for entropy

1306
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,960
transferred from B to a in the direction

1307
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:01,560
of the our Arrow so it's it's a positive

1308
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:05,360
number if the slow is in the direction

1309
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:09,880
of the arrow otherwise it's a

1310
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:12,880
negative and so we can write this as a

1311
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,880
balance

1312
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,080
equation a balance

1313
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:21,520
equation uh for a reversible process you

1314
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,800
wouldn't have this part would simply

1315
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,719
say that if there is a change in

1316
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:29,679
enthropy of your system it is due to the

1317
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:30,480
amount that it has of entropy that has

1318
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,840
been

1319
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,840
transferred with this

1320
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:39,600
environment but then entropy is not

1321
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,480
really

1322
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,199
always conserved it's conserved only in

1323
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,679
a reversible process in an irreversible

1324
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:50,159
process it's not

1325
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:53,960
conserved and if the process is a way

1326
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:56,679
process it can only increase so that

1327
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:00,800
means

1328
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:05,880
that the entropy change of my

1329
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:09,639
system can be greater than the amount it

1330
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,639
received but cannot be

1331
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:17,840
lower so essentially we are writing an

1332
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:19,159
an inbalance equation and a balance

1333
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,719
equation if you

1334
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:26,400
want uh it becomes a balance equation if

1335
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:28,600
you put in the balance also um

1336
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:34,000
the imbalance by calling it

1337
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:34,000
enop generated or produced by uh

1338
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:42,800
aab and this brings us to the uh en

1339
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,800
balance

1340
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,920
equation I assume that you have um play

1341
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:56,560
with

1342
01:12:50,920 --> 01:13:00,320
this in solving problems uh in undergrad

1343
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:05,239
thermodynamics and your applications in

1344
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:08,520
energy or exergy analysis uh any uh

1345
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:10,320
technological uh uh

1346
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:14,679
problem to

1347
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:17,320
do with uh energy transformation of

1348
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:19,239
energy various Force requires you to

1349
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,280
make not only an energy balance but also

1350
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:23,080
an entropy balance and the and the

1351
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:27,480
combination of the two is what allows

1352
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:31,080
you to determine uh things like uh how

1353
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:32,920
good am I doing uh what's the efficiency

1354
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,800
of what I'm

1355
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:38,480
doing so these balance equations as we

1356
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,360
see more

1357
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:47,639
explicitly are the fundamentals to

1358
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:51,520
Define efficiencies of U um Power blands

1359
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:57,040
and uh any

1360
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:57,040
lies that does transformation of edge

1361
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:04,199
okay this is also um the version of the

1362
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,679
entropy

1363
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:09,679
balance a r version of the entropy

1364
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:11,520
balance if you have the kind of

1365
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,520
description in which you can follow as a

1366
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,159
function of time the state of the system

1367
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,800
therefore you can measure as a function

1368
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:23,239
of time the entropy and also how much

1369
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:28,360
entropy is we exchange

1370
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:31,679
them as in the right of the entropy

1371
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:35,639
exchange and remember that in an entropy

1372
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:38,960
balance there are three very distinct

1373
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:42,920
elements there are three parts of the

1374
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:46,560
equation the left hand side says how

1375
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:49,280
much the property changes from the final

1376
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,280
to the initial

1377
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:58,480
State the transfer term says how much

1378
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:00,280
the system the net uh entropy that has

1379
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,639
been received by your system or

1380
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,280
exchanged if it is negative it's given

1381
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:07,800
out by a

1382
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:12,199
system due to interactions it's a flow

1383
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,199
of ENT going in and out of your

1384
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:19,320
system the last term

1385
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,080
inste

1386
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,639
is the

1387
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:26,560
generation it occurs internally to your

1388
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:29,920
system it's the

1389
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:33,760
dissipation it's the waste and the curse

1390
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:36,280
if you let thing

1391
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:41,000
uh

1392
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:46,800
uh move around for example you take

1393
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:49,920
um Irish coffee no uh it's very nice if

1394
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,320
you until it is separate first time you

1395
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:56,320
see it you were

1396
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:59,840
excited if you stir it you lose you lose

1397
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:03,040
the the beauty no and by Sting it you

1398
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:05,320
have uh mixed up things you have

1399
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,320
produced uh

1400
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:11,280
generated you

1401
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:15,639
lost I mean the beauty because you are

1402
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:19,360
sort of big trunk and so that's

1403
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:22,840
but this gives the idea of the fact that

1404
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:25,760
stirring um is something

1405
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,520
that happens uh

1406
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:32,120
spontaneously uh if you help it by

1407
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:34,360
stiring it it help it it goes

1408
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,080
faster and it's something that you

1409
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:40,600
cannot

1410
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:43,480
undo I mean the Irish thing will not uh

1411
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:48,600
separ maybe to but

1412
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:51,840
uh not in not not in sure talking about

1413
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:55,800
um energy

1414
01:16:51,840 --> 01:17:00,000
applications so the if you're not

1415
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:03,440
uh careful enough and things get stirred

1416
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,040
up you lose opportunities to convert the

1417
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:09,840
energy and to extract energy out of your

1418
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,840
source and you've lost it

1419
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:15,280
forever

1420
01:17:17,639 --> 01:17:23,840
okay luckily

1421
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:26,040
um I don't think this time this I don't

1422
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,320
think today but

1423
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,840
the next time we will be able to

1424
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,880
introduce

1425
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:36,239
a a graphical representation of all that

1426
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:41,040
we have said that is very useful to

1427
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:45,480
remember and to reason uh

1428
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:46,560
um uh the various consequences and also

1429
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:49,159
to set

1430
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,639
up problem solving and answering

1431
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:56,840
additional questions it will be the

1432
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:56,840
energy versus entropy uh di down

1433
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:02,880
uh but we're still building up uh

1434
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:06,480
material so that we can use the diagram

1435
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:09,159
to summarize what we have seen so

1436
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:12,080
far and one of these ingredients that we

1437
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:14,600
still need is um another theorem that is

1438
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:17,840
called the maximum entropy principle

1439
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:23,760
which says that um among all the states

1440
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:26,280
of a of a given system once you fix the

1441
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,400
value the values of the amounts of

1442
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,840
constituents and the parameters the

1443
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,840
external

1444
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:37,920
forces and uh you

1445
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:40,520
consider of course you remember that uh

1446
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,639
if I fix the amounts of constituents

1447
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,639
let's call

1448
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:47,000
them n of

1449
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:50,320
T let's forget the t

1450
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,320
n n

1451
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,840
beta this doesn't uh fix the state

1452
01:18:53,320 --> 01:19:00,920
because the state

1453
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:03,880
is these numbers plus the values of all

1454
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:06,520
the conceivable

1455
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,760
properties most of the times this list

1456
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:13,440
is an infinite number of

1457
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:17,920
numbers okay so fixing just this two

1458
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,920
leaves you again with an Infinity of

1459
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,840
States now suppose I I fix also the

1460
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:29,880
value of the N

1461
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:34,280
energy okay so I fix this

1462
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:37,400
much still I have a lot of stat they

1463
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,760
will differ in the values of all these

1464
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:42,040
other properties but they have the same

1465
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,040
energy okay so if I consider all these

1466
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,520
states that have the same energy amounts

1467
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:49,960
of constituents and uh parameters of the

1468
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,960
exteral

1469
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:57,719
forces it's a set in this set the second

1470
01:19:54,199 --> 01:20:01,040
law first assertion says there is a

1471
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:01,040
unique Saum

1472
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,960
State this theorem

1473
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:09,600
says that state is also the highest

1474
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,600
value for the

1475
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:20,080
an and it's a strict uh uh

1476
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:22,600
inequality it's it's the only state that

1477
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:26,040
has that value all other states with the

1478
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:29,280
same energy and so on uh

1479
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,280
have lesser

1480
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,880
entropy the stable State among these

1481
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,080
ones is the one that

1482
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:40,840
achieves the maximum value is and it is

1483
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:44,360
the only one that achieves their far

1484
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,360
this is called the maximum entopic

1485
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:52,239
Bri there is also a dual uh principle uh

1486
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,000
that it's called the minimum and energy

1487
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,840
fre similar to this one except that here

1488
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:06,719
you put

1489
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,040
s so if I consider all the states of a

1490
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:13,360
system that have same given same values

1491
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:13,360
of n beta and the same

1492
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:22,000
entropy then among all these

1493
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,400
states there is one St stable

1494
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,360
equilibrium state

1495
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,360
only and and it is the lowest

1496
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:36,120
energy when you fix the value of s to

1497
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:42,800
zero that corresponds to the the domain

1498
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,800
of

1499
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:50,520
mechanics and that minimum energy stable

1500
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:52,679
equilibrium state is the only one and so

1501
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,960
then we recover the minimum energy fre

1502
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:55,960
for of mechanics

1503
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:06,199
but thermodynamics is about states that

1504
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,199
have also entropies difference from

1505
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:18,000
zero and so we have a more General

1506
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:21,000
minimum yes in that we basically saying

1507
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
that

1508
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:38,960
um yes if you start from um the low

1509
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,960
estable eum

1510
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:45,120
State

1511
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:49,120
um like this one is a stable equum

1512
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,120
state if you spend some

1513
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:58,320
work so if I go this direction and I

1514
01:22:54,080 --> 01:23:02,960
spend some work I can obtain any other

1515
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:06,520
state any other state but

1516
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:09,320
only those that have the same entropy as

1517
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:12,159
I started with if the process is

1518
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:16,280
reversible I the entropy will remain

1519
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:18,600
constant so I can I can go from my

1520
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:21,159
minimum energy stable equilibrium state

1521
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:24,920
to any other state Which is higher

1522
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:28,960
energy because I put in some work

1523
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:33,560
but it um if it is um reversible it has

1524
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:36,360
the same U entropy if it is irreversible

1525
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:40,159
it would have higher entropy so I can go

1526
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:43,280
only let's say if I'm here with energy I

1527
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:46,280
can go up and then this is entropy so

1528
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:50,960
this will okay so I start with certain

1529
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:53,440
value of the entropy say s uh

1530
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:57,239
R I can go

1531
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:59,280
up in a reversible process to values of

1532
01:23:57,239 --> 01:24:02,639
the

1533
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,719
energy higher than I started with so

1534
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:11,199
this is

1535
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:13,960
e or I can also go to the right

1536
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:16,960
because I put in

1537
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:21,440
energy but if the process is

1538
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:24,520
irreversible I generate some entropy so

1539
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:27,040
the entropy adds and I go to the left to

1540
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,040
the to the

1541
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:33,320
right so so yes thanks because this

1542
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:36,560
anticipates essentially this energy

1543
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:39,239
versus entropy diagram and which is

1544
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,760
useful because as you know a picture is

1545
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:44,280
worth a thousand words and uh uh this is

1546
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:48,040
the picture that allows you to answer

1547
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:48,040
this uh kind of

1548
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:58,159
questions uh the last ingredient we need

1549
01:24:55,159 --> 01:25:03,679
in order to go to that graphical

1550
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:03,679
representation is called the state

1551
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:11,800
principle again it is a consequence very

1552
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:13,520
directly from the first assertion of the

1553
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:19,520
second

1554
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:19,520
law which says You Fix N and

1555
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:25,280
beta fix and in beta

1556
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,880
you fix the

1557
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:33,880
energy and once these are fixed there is

1558
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:37,360
a

1559
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,400
unique there exists a unique stable

1560
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:42,400
equilibrium

1561
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,400
State

1562
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:52,719
T all right the last s means

1563
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:56,440
stay so yes it's a state which is stable

1564
01:25:52,719 --> 01:26:01,520
equilibrium so what does mean state

1565
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:06,280
state means the values of all the

1566
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:10,000
properties so that means that this thing

1567
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,000
fixes the values of all the

1568
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:25,000
properties of course we're talking about

1569
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:26,800
overstable equili

1570
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,360
could

1571
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,560
stake

1572
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:34,719
so we so

1573
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,760
mathematically that's exactly what we

1574
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:41,560
mean by a function the properties it

1575
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:44,000
means that this properties any property

1576
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:46,800
is a function of these numbers if these

1577
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:51,040
numbers fix the value that's what we

1578
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:52,280
mean by value of a such so we can write

1579
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:57,080
a

1580
01:26:52,280 --> 01:27:00,760
property of stable ium at

1581
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:03,679
Saum as a function of the amounts the

1582
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:06,960
parameters and the

1583
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:10,400
energy and since among the various

1584
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:12,199
properties we Define and entropy we can

1585
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:17,199
also write that for the entropy so we

1586
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:20,280
can say that for the St equum States the

1587
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:22,320
entropy the value of the a of be six

1588
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,840
like call

1589
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:27,639
Properties by the amount of constituents

1590
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:30,480
the parameters of the forces and the end

1591
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:32,800
this expression this formula this

1592
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:36,679
function is called the foundamental

1593
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:40,480
relation for the Saum States in some

1594
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:40,480
oldfashioned books of

1595
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:49,360
thermodynamics this function is page one

1596
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,960
you take the book by colen Ken was a PhD

1597
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:55,040
from MIT

1598
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:58,239
also uh very nice contributions

1599
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:01,679
but in his times uh thermodynamics was

1600
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:06,320
only about sa

1601
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:10,880
St and so that's the starting point and

1602
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:13,639
U since I'm I'm I'm e it why not say and

1603
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:16,320
reminding you that instead we've seen a

1604
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:16,320
definition of

1605
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:21,600
entropy uh

1606
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:25,040
today in which you may or may have not

1607
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:29,119
noticed but I will stress it anyway

1608
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:30,960
that we never said anything about how

1609
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:32,000
many particles the part the system

1610
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:35,920
should

1611
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,560
have in our game so far we could have a

1612
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:44,159
system with one particle or 10 to the

1613
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:46,000
23 it could be just water in a box or a

1614
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:49,480
nuclear power

1615
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:54,600
plant complex or

1616
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:58,480
SLE small or large plus we didn't make

1617
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,480
any assumption about the kind of

1618
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:03,960
state

1619
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:06,400
fact uh most interesting

1620
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,080
states are those that are not savable

1621
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,639
equilibrium at least from the point of

1622
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:12,639
view of making a weight

1623
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:15,080
process because in a stable equilibrium

1624
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,679
State we just we just have seen that the

1625
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:20,000
perpetual motion machine of the second

1626
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:24,239
kind is impossible you cannot extract uh

1627
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:27,119
work so not very useful from from an

1628
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:27,119
engineering point of

1629
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:34,920
view and that's why uh consider the

1630
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:37,159
ocean the ocean is a as a thermal

1631
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,560
Reservoir not the waves that's a

1632
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:41,239
different story but there a thermal

1633
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,320
Reservoir and if you forget also the

1634
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:46,360
fact that the inside there are

1635
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:49,639
temperature gradients and also salinity

1636
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:53,480
radi so on but if you fake Co it as a

1637
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:56,960
huge uh system so it has a huge amount

1638
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:59,719
of energy but that energy is essentially

1639
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:04,560
useless the thermal energy is

1640
01:29:59,719 --> 01:30:04,560
useless because it's in a equum

1641
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:12,360
state

1642
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:14,920
whereas if I have a a system in a non-e

1643
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,920
equilibrium

1644
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:22,960
State uh and I'm quick enough to extract

1645
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:25,320
its adiabatic availability I can do

1646
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:29,560
something useful

1647
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:32,280
for example we will do uh later on

1648
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:36,719
uh in the second part we will do like

1649
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:39,639
chical Rea you think of uh what happens

1650
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:42,679
inside your internal combustion engine

1651
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:45,400
got the Piston you got a mixture of air

1652
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:48,719
and and

1653
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:54,239
gasoline and uh you like the

1654
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:57,840
SP at that moment you produce an on

1655
01:30:54,239 --> 01:31:02,199
state which very quickly in matter of

1656
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:04,639
micros and milliseconds will uh uh

1657
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:08,600
interest the entire combustion

1658
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:11,480
chamber pressure will go up and so

1659
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:15,960
on the internal combustion engine is an

1660
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:19,119
incredible incredible uh device that uh

1661
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:22,360
has been there for a century now maybe

1662
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:24,719
longer uh and it's still uh powering our

1663
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:31,840
cars and uh

1664
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:31,840
because it's a smart way to extract the

1665
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:37,719
availability it doesn't do the entire

1666
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:40,679
job though

1667
01:31:37,719 --> 01:31:43,639
because it loses the opportunity that

1668
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:47,560
you have from when you uh light the

1669
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:50,560
spark to when uh uh the flame is uh

1670
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:54,000
engal the entire combustion

1671
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:58,280
chamber that is a very irreversible

1672
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:03,280
uh process and that's where you lose uh

1673
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:06,639
the about um what is it 60% of uh of

1674
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:10,280
your uh availability no because internal

1675
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:13,040
combustion engine is 40% efficient so

1676
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:16,960
that means that I lost 60%

1677
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,960
somewhere and that's where I lost

1678
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:22,600
it

1679
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:25,280
uh

1680
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:29,360
so no equilibrium

1681
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:32,080
States and so we Define entropy uh also

1682
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:34,320
for non equilibrium states which is most

1683
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:36,360
important for the more modern

1684
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:39,119
applications of thermodynamics and

1685
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,119
that's why we're

1686
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:49,000
here actually uh I was um very happy

1687
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:50,520
just yesterday to receive um any an may

1688
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,679
I think it was sent to the entire

1689
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:56,400
Community not very special but uh I

1690
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:59,800
didn't email from the MIT president

1691
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:02,800
announcing this initiative about

1692
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,800
climat

1693
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:10,119
okay uh a

1694
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:13,840
lot of the applications that will U come

1695
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:18,360
out of that uh project in in the

1696
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:20,679
future uh will have to do with energy

1697
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:24,719
and the best use of

1698
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:29,639
energy okay not only

1699
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:32,880
CO2 segregation or greenhouse gases but

1700
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:37,400
all the crazy ideas that people are

1701
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:40,880
talking about in uh trying to control uh

1702
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:44,760
uh for example the the amount of uh uh

1703
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:46,320
heating that that comes uh uh to the sun

1704
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,480
there was an article the other day in

1705
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:53,040
the New York Times talking about people

1706
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:58,280
that uh want to build a shieldy Spades

1707
01:33:53,040 --> 01:34:00,920
no to to um reflect away some of the

1708
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:03,280
power some of the photons that come from

1709
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,639
from from the Sun so that you could

1710
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:08,840
control temperature of course you need

1711
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:12,400
you need a surface to I think it was

1712
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:14,840
like uh the surface of the entire um

1713
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,719
Argentina which is essentially half of

1714
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:18,960
South

1715
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:22,639
America there somewhere put in a in a

1716
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:24,360
place which they call it the lrange

1717
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:27,000
place or lrange

1718
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,480
SP where it would say because the

1719
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,800
gravitational force on the sun is on the

1720
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:38,920
earth is the same all right so uh yes

1721
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:41,840
crazy ideas but one one tool with which

1722
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:44,639
you have to evaluate these ideas and see

1723
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:48,199
if they are feasible or

1724
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:50,639
not is precisely what we are doing here

1725
01:34:48,199 --> 01:34:54,440
for any energy technology or for any

1726
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:57,280
technology you have to see uh that

1727
01:34:54,440 --> 01:35:00,119
you're transforming forms of energy of

1728
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:02,400
you're you're spending energy to rec to

1729
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:05,199
recover another effect you have to

1730
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:07,800
Define efficiency feasibility and

1731
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:11,520
efficiency are very important now

1732
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:14,719
because if you if the amount of energy

1733
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:16,400
you consuming for a certain task is more

1734
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:20,199
than the

1735
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:23,320
the the the work minimum work to do that

1736
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:27,719
task uh it's worthless you better not do

1737
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:32,280
it we can do it in another way okay

1738
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:33,920
so uh what I'm saying is that uh somehow

1739
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:38,280
by learning

1740
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:40,760
these tools and ways to understand the

1741
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,600
equilibrium and non equilibrium for

1742
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:48,080
small and for large and small

1743
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:52,239
systems uh you are in good position to

1744
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:55,440
go and contribute to this uh very bold

1745
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:58,400
uh MIT project for might uh Enterprise

1746
01:35:55,440 --> 01:36:01,760
for the next 10

1747
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:05,239
years so that brings me

1748
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:10,480
to yeah one one more thing and then uh

1749
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:10,480
just we have three minutes once I had a

1750
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:21,080
function like this function

1751
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:25,639
here then I can apply all the tools of

1752
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:28,480
mathematics for example if I in looking

1753
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:32,280
how the function behaves in the

1754
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:35,679
neighborhood of uh the given point so

1755
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:40,119
here's the function and I'm here and I

1756
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:42,239
want to see uh how it behaves in the

1757
01:36:40,119 --> 01:36:45,520
neighborhood by changing one of the

1758
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:49,639
variables for example the

1759
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:52,600
energy right I can

1760
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:56,639
uh write a series expansion on the

1761
01:36:52,600 --> 01:37:00,920
function I take derivatives first second

1762
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,320
order if the function is uh um Regular

1763
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:05,199
enough so that it's going to take at

1764
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:07,719
least two the first two Thea to Che all

1765
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:10,199
the variables you in good

1766
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:13,159
shape and in

1767
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:14,840
practice in most of the models the the

1768
01:37:13,159 --> 01:37:17,119
the function is analytic so it there's

1769
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,119
all

1770
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,280
der some of these partial derivatives

1771
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,679
will turn out to

1772
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:37,480
be uh

1773
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:40,239
useful and to be um important uh in

1774
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:43,440
determining um necessary conditions for

1775
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,440
Mutual equilibrium between

1776
01:37:43,639 --> 01:37:47,679
systems and it turns out that all the

1777
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:50,040
first derivatives the first partial

1778
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:54,280
derivatives of this function

1779
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:55,840
here play a role uh in deter meaning

1780
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:59,239
those uh

1781
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:01,119
mutually uh conditions and that's why we

1782
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:04,239
give

1783
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:06,280
names for example the derivative of s

1784
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:09,480
with respect to

1785
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,119
e is the inverse of what we will call

1786
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:13,400
the

1787
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:16,760
temperature of the stable equilibrium

1788
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,760
state of the

1789
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:24,400
system yeah that's because I I I write

1790
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,440
it also this way

1791
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,199
is a derivative of s of e with respect

1792
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:31,760
to

1793
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:37,360
S uh because once you have a function

1794
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:40,440
and if it is U uh well behaved enough so

1795
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:43,159
that all the derivatives are not neither

1796
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:45,360
zero or infinite you can invert the

1797
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:48,280
faction okay there are mathematical

1798
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:50,280
theorems for inting faction so if I add

1799
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:53,159
this function of s and the function of E

1800
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:55,520
I can also most of the times write it as

1801
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:59,040
a e is a function of

1802
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:01,520
s if I can do that not for all systems

1803
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:05,080
we'll see you can do that but if you can

1804
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:07,280
do that P then you have another version

1805
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:09,280
of the fundamental relation which is the

1806
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:12,719
energy form because it makes energy

1807
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:14,639
explicit and entropy becomes a dependent

1808
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:16,880
independent

1809
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:19,520
variable and you can also take

1810
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:22,280
derivatives of this one so the partial

1811
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:25,320
derivative of B with respect to S is

1812
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:27,880
going to be what we call the temperature

1813
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:30,040
of the stable equilibrium State the

1814
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:33,639
partial of e with respect to n is going

1815
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:35,400
to be the total potential or chemical

1816
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:38,080
potential depending on

1817
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:40,840
situations and uh if one of the

1818
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:43,199
parameters is the volume the the partial

1819
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:46,159
of the energy in respect to the volume

1820
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:52,080
is what we will call the pressure with

1821
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:54,520
the negative in front signning front

1822
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:57,920
so this

1823
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:59,880
um partial derivatives are related to

1824
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:03,199
conditions for Mutual equilibrium and

1825
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:06,960
are also therefore related to

1826
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:10,760
instruments with which you measure

1827
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:14,199
them by exploiting the mutual

1828
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:16,239
equilibrium condition so you have the

1829
01:40:14,199 --> 01:40:18,639
thermometer the

1830
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:23,840
monometer and

1831
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:26,239
the uh again u a manometer that allows

1832
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:29,239
you to measure partial pressures so that

1833
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:32,960
you can compete mechanical

1834
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:36,520
poten all right so we are out of time

1835
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:38,920
and uh we stop here so next time we go

1836
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:41,800
to the energy versus

1837
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:46,920
entropy diagrams to summarize all that

1838
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:46,920
we have seen and go further
