[Applause]

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,600
thank you my name is Sher arriman I'm

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,920
one of the co-founders and the CEO at

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,320
concerto biosciences where we are making

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,440
it possible to tap into one of our

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,599
world's largest untapped natural

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,480
resources and that is the microbes that

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,600
live in us and around

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,519
us your body is covered in billions of

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,720
microbes and so is the surface of every

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,599
object in the world our food animals

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,880
plants our buildings so products that

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,879
tap into this microbial world are the

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
inevitable future of medicine food and

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,200
consumer

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,520
goods creating these products will

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
unlock an incredible amount of value but

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,840
only a small fraction of this has been

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,960
accessed today and the major roadblock

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,440
that stands between us in capturing this

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,520
value is knowledge it is very difficult

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,920
to predict which microbes will make the

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,320
best or the most effective products so

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,000
whoever can rely reliably predict

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,520
microbial performance can unlock these

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
products and then capture this economic

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,479
real

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,200
estate well if prediction is our problem

29
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,640
we live in the age of AI let's build an

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,400
AI model that can take in all of the

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
possible different microbial products

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,240
and predict which ones will be

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,960
effective this is a very reasonable idea

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,159
and so it begs the question why has this

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,079
not happened yet we would argue that a

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,280
major deterrent to building these models

37
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,119
is having the right data microbes live

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,799
in very complex ecosystems and the same

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,759
way that human behavior is shaped by all

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,360
of the humans around us microbial

41
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,439
behavior is shaped by the microbes that

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,240
are around to them unfortunately the

43
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,799
technologies that we have today to study

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,960
microbes don't actually teach us very

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,600
much about how microbes interact and

46
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,360
this leaves us trying to build models

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,520
with very incomplete

48
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,280
information what we need

49
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,399
is measurements of how microbes perform

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,200
in the context of the other microbes

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,039
around them but this turns into a

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,959
massive combinatorial math problem if

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,239
you have a thousand microbes and you

54
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,680
want to measure all the different

55
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,879
combinations you're talking about

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,920
millions and billions of combinations of

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,720
microbes that you would have to

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
construct and measure and even the

59
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,480
fastest robots today can't do

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,080
that so while we were at MIT we invented

61
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,319
a technology called kchip and kchip

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,120
takes in um nanoliter droplets of

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,480
microbial cultures and randomly combines

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,159
them into combinations we can make

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,360
millions of combinations and then

66
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,040
measure how each of those combinations

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,080
performs using microscopy like the image

68
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,000
that you see

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,920
here with kchip we have breached the

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,080
threshold of data sets that are large

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,440
enough to tr to train an AI model of

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,959
microbial performance the academic

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,920
prototype of kchip was already producing

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,159
data sets that were 10 times larger than

75
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,400
the next largest uh data available in

76
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,360
Academia and since starting kerto in

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,640
2020 we've gained another order of

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,120
magnitude making kerto the sole owner of

79
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,280
the data set that enables this kind of

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,680
AI modeling of microbial

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,879
performance with this data we've trained

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,040
a model that we call Kai and most

83
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,480
importantly kchip data whether used

84
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,760
alone or with Kai enables us to find

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,760
products that address High unmet needs

86
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,480
applications one of the areas that is

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,360
ripe for disruption by micro based

88
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,439
ingredients is skin and scalp care the

89
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,159
majority of ingredients in this space

90
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,920
are decades old leaving consumers

91
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,879
frustrated and bored microbial

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,760
ingredients on the other hand offer a

93
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,599
novel gentle and sophisticated approach

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,200
to Skin Care allowing Brands to

95
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,680
establish leadership with their

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,879
consumers one of the major um microbes

97
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,560
that causes these skin conditions is

98
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,200
staf orius when the skin microbiome is

99
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,239
disrupted staff orus becomes virulent

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,680
and it causes dryness irritation and

101
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,400
rashes however the healthy skin

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,639
microbiome normally pacifies staff orus

103
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,440
through these interactions with staff so

104
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,400
we can imagine designing um an effective

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,919
product to treat dryness irritation and

106
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,880
rash by finding combinations of microbes

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,199
that inhibit staff or's

108
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,120
virulence using kchip we made millions

109
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
of combinations of skin microbes

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
measured how they influenc storus and

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,520
then used this massive data set to find

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,320
a new therapeutic for atopic dermatitis

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,400
that's in a phase 1B study now as well

114
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,600
as in um consumer product ingredients

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,160
for skin irritation and we're working on

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,039
formulating those KP can be applied to

117
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,039
Industries Far Beyond skin and and um

118
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,680
scalp care we've done successful pilot

119
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,000
programs in um agriculture food

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
ingredients consumer care we're actively

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,080
seeking Partners both for our existing

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,080
assets and to

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,960
co-discovery and scalp care vaginal

124
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,639
health and food um ingredients so be

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,120
very happy to talk about any of those

126
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,759
areas with you at the break thank

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,759
you so much
