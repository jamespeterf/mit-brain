00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,839
All great ideas start out bad. Most look

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,240
horrible at the start. And yet, this

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,240
should come as a relief. That idea you

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,160
had or heard this morning that everyone

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,880
laughed at could be the start of

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,960
something. That's right. The idea does

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,279
not need to look disruptive or scalable

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
or exponential or like a business. You

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,720
can start with what you have. This is

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,320
often difficult for people to accept.

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
Most innovation stories are told in

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
hindsight, [music] which creates a

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,679
cognitive bias. If you have read a lot

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,279
of innovation stories, it may be hard to

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
accept that the start of those great

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,000
stories is a poor fit for the

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
innovations they became. But success

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,800
isn't hiding in the idea. It follows

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,719
from what you do next.
