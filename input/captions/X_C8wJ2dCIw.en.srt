1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,320
startup exchange uh discussion as I said

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:11,960
earlier at the beginning uh at MIT we uh

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,960
you know we we we don't just do research

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,119
uh we do produce companies uh companies

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,760
that will take the research F findings

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,880
to the uh prototype to the market and to

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,560
make an impact so that's why we have the

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,960
next session about uh startat exchange

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,079
and and my my colleague Karina will more

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,920
moderat the session and uh I'll just let

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,920
her take over

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,360
Karina thank you CJ for the kind

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,360
introduction hello everyone I'm

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,079
delighted to be here with you today to

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,199
present the startup lightning docks

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,760
we've invited two startups for you to

17
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,960
meet each one will present for 10

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,280
minutes followed by five minutes of Q&A

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,000
so please keep sending your question

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,280
through the Q&A feature but first I'd

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,080
like to take a couple of minutes to tell

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,439
you about our

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,159
program so startup exchange was created

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,040
within MIT corporate relations to

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,320
support MIT connected startups to grow

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,759
expand and solve The World's great

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,880
challenges and we do that by fostering

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,479
collaboration and Partnerships between

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,240
uh startups and Industry such as um

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,600
corporate members of the industry his

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,799
own program as many of you are and the

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,640
MIT Innovation

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,600
ecosystem so the startups we support all

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,040
of them must have a strong connection

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,880
with the Institute this connection might

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,960
come through the founding team the

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,360
technology and some um are also

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,719
Affiliated to uh our MIT peers who vet

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,719
and support the startups throughout the

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:59,079
year um today our program has a network

41
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,360
of close to a thousand startups

42
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,600
virtually work

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,280
in any sector they also may be located

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,160
in any country and we typically start

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,520
working with them when um they have a

46
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,480
technology or a product that is ready to

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,440
be tested or used in Real

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,440
Environment so everything we do at

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,760
startup exchange is to expose and

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,599
connect startups with the industry in a

51
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,480
highly Curative way and we also provide

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,519
learning opportunities to both parties

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
this includes launching calls for

54
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,120
startups based on carpet's own

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,360
challenges and strategic priorities

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,800
facilitating one-on-one meetings between

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,760
them and hosting different kinds of

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
events such as demo days um speed

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,800
networking events speach sessions and

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,480
the learning opportunities typically

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,159
come through via workshops that we uh

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,080
co-organize with our MIT peers so at the

63
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:02,680
end of the day the goal um of all these

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,760
activities is to fold um on the one hand

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,840
help startups uh scale pivot expand your

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,920
customer base and in case of corpet help

67
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,080
them learn as well about the most recent

68
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,799
Technologies um help them uh expand your

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,640
portfolio or even create new business

70
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,720
lines and um this slide features a very

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,280
small sample of the success cases we

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:33,159
have to date uh that usually uh include

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,360
proofs of concept Pilots um joint uh Rd

74
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,959
R&D and even

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
Acquisitions um this is startup Exchange

76
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,280

please do send us your questions through

86
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,079
the Q&A feature thank

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,720
you well thank you thank you Katherine

88
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
and thank you for giving us the

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,519
opportunity to present at this event um

90
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,639
our affiliation with MIT is through uh

91
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,120
Chris o Brian who's an alumni alumni of

92
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,160
MIT and a shareholder of one of the uh

93
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,440
IIs group companies um i' like to take

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,880
this opportunity to provide you an

95
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,080
interest C into a company IIs absorption

96
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,560
in um and the mission of this company is

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,600
to enable a sustainable and circular

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,520
economy um we engineer manufactur and

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,960
service most advanced gas condition and

100
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,639
purification products that enable a

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,520
sustainable and circular future for the

102
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,479
planet so think of the company as as a a

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,280
company that that produces products that

104
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,759
are like the genes and shovels of the

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,120
clean tech future uh our focus is in gas

106
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,880
conditioning and gas per ification and

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,639
these are based on our two core

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,199
Technologies temperature swing

109
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,639
absorption and pressure swing

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:15,600
absorption um the TSA technology is used

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:18,080
in um in in in our gas dryers um we and

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,240
and we use them to dehydrate very

113
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,479
various types of gases we started with

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,039
uh air dryers many years ago and then we

115
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,840
transition to um doing methane and

116
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
renewable natural gas dryers the methane

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,360
dryers are used in uh compressed natural

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,199
gas stations in North America uh and

119
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,400
more recently we've been deploying these

120
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,360
dryers in uh bio gas upgrading

121
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,759
facilities or renewable natural gas uh

122
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,240
generation sites um and and and more and

123
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,520
and now we are looking at hydrogen

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,039
whether it's green hydrogen or other

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,319
sources of hydrogen um those those uh

126
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,199
generation Pathways require hydrogen

127
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,800
drying for either fuel cell application

128
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,720
or industrial applications and we deploy

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,479
hydrogen dryers for for those sites um

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,759
our pressure swing absorption technology

131
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,759
is used to separate a mixture of gases

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,440
in many applications in the clean energy

133
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,319
industry um the core of our our

134
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,919
knowledge is in the absor absorption

135
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:20,479
materials themselves um so we we uh we

136
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,840
select and design absorbents that are

137
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,960
are used to separate um gases in a in a

138
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,560
pressure swing absorption system and and

139
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,680
our expertise in is in layering the

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,759
different types of absorbance and um and

141
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,840
making sure that the right Purity and

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,360
Recovery is achieved uh in the process

143
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,120
um so we've used this PSA technology

144
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,880
extensively in many many areas um PSS in

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,319
general have been around in the oil and

146
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,560
gas industry for a long time what is

147
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,560
unique about the ivis Technologies is

148
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,319
this combination of our knowledge and

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,199
absorbance and our um very unique what

150
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,639
we call a rotary Vala fast cycle

151
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,520
PSA and to explain that difference

152
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,280
between a conventional PSA and and a

153
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,879
rotary Val PSA there are two images on

154
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,120
the slide uh the image that you look at

155
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,919
on the left is a typical conventional

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,440
PSA um so it involves in in in in terms

157
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,120
of PSA purification what you typically

158
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,720
do depending on the gas mixtures and the

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,280
the Purity that you need you have

160
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,960
multi-stages of

161
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,080
purification and a conventional PSA

162
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,759
typically has um three or four stages of

163
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,080
purification and you see these tanks

164
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,599
they are very large tanks that are

165
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,199
filled with absorbance and these all

166
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,479
these tanks are connected through a lot

167
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,280
of plumbing and valving and these valves

168
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,400
are used to navigate the flow between

169
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,840
the various

170
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,840
tanks um what that what that does is it

171
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,199
obviously makes the the plant size quite

172
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,080
large it's complex um and and they have

173
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
no numerous switching valves and and

174
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,120
typically the failure modes for these

175
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,960
PSAs are the

176
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,840
valves what we been able to do is

177
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
replace all the plumbing and the valves

178
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,199
by what is called a rotary valve it's a

179
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,800
it's think imagine two metal discs that

180
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,800
are rotating um and there are lots of

181
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,479
channels that are machined within those

182
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,280
discs um and as these discs rotate we we

183
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,400
use the the channels to transport the

184
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,400
gases between the various cylinders so

185
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,159
what that's done in terms of uh uh in

186
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,759
terms of advancing the technology the

187
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,039
fast cycle PSA makes these vessels about

188
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,519
10 times small smaller and also

189
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,599
eliminates all the valving and the

190
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,399
plumbing so uh so you basically

191
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,039
miniaturize the industrial scale

192
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,680
Solutions into a much smaller system uh

193
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
which we manufacture at a factory and

194
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,560
ship to site and and as you're using

195
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,160
less amount of absorbance and less

196
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,680
amount of metal clearly uh it also

197
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,200
reduces the cost so we have used this

198
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,120
technology in many markets um but uh

199
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,519
over the last 10 years uh a lot in the

200
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,880
in the in in the clean energy space um

201
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,760
we've done a lot of work in renewable

202
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,120
natural gas U more recently in in in

203
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,519
many areas of hydrogen and now we are

204
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
introducing products in the carbon

205
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,920
capture space also um what I like to do

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,320
is the next few minutes talk a little

207
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,560
bit about our offering in the RNG space

208
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,200
and also the hydrogen

209
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,519
space so when it when it comes uh to

210
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,240
producing Ren renewable natural gas that

211
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,880
the the lingo that's used is called

212
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,040
biogas upgrading so the biog gas is

213
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,560
generated in uh many different

214
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,720
applications landfills Wastewater

215
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,720
treatments organic waste diversion da

216
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,120
Farms so a lot of these sites um the bio

217
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
the biom material is fermented and the

218
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,200
bio gas that comes out of there has a

219
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
combination of methane and CO2 and in

220
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,920
some cases with landfills you also have

221
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,600
some oxygen and nitrogen and other

222
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,800
contaminants so what we do is we take

223
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,200
that biogas and we use our PSA solution

224
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,640
to separate the methane from the CO2 and

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,680
that methane is called the renewable

226
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,360
natural gas is then either injected into

227
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,880
pipelines or it's used for

228
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,560
transportation fuel um so this is an

229
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,160
area that's uh we've been working in

230
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,560
this space for a while um we have about

231
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,640
uh I think it's close to 100 deployments

232
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,720
worldwide um just as an example of the

233
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,920
types of projects that we are involved

234
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,320
with uh these are four locations uh the

235
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,279
top two the top left is uh is in in

236
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,000
Toronto that's the organic waste

237
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,360
diversion facility for the city of

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Toronto so all the organic waste comes

239
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,600
there it gets digested we take the

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,120
biogas from there we take out the sulfur

241
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,560
um or the H2S and then um and then we

242
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,480
upgrade the the bagas to to make RNG and

243
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,160
the RNG is injected into the pipelines U

244
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,720
the the side on the right is for the

245
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,240
city of Montreal uh again we have very

246
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,800
large uh plant there

247
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,200
um so both the locations in Toronto and

248
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,720
in Montreal we have uh we have managed

249
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,000
the construction of the site and also uh

250
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,399
do we provide services to those two

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,560
cities uh in terms of operating those

252
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:20,399
sites um we depl a lot of product in

253
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,120
Europe um much smaller scale um in uh

254
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,519
and we have done about 40 sites in

255
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,160
France and about five in Italy to date

256
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,040
um and we continue to expand in that

257
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,480
area typically we do about

258
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,279
five or 10 bio gas projects per year

259
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:40,000
these are these are obviously sizable uh

260
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:43,120
projects um more recently um there's

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,639
been a focus on uh farm digestors and

262
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,160
and the driver behind the biogas

263
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,320
industry that uh that uh the the the

264
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,880
economic driver is really that the

265
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,959
renewable natural gas that is formed it

266
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,959
is classified as a D3 Ren under the

267
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,880
Renewable Fuel standard so um and on top

268
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,880
of that you can add the lcf credits that

269
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,800
you get so the developers that are

270
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,200
developing this projects U take

271
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,200
advantage of the D3 r value and the lcfs

272
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,760
value and they're able to sell that to

273
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,920
the Renewable Fuel Market um so we've

274
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,079
been doing a lot of projects in the

275
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,760
Midwest and in California here you're

276
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:20,399
looking at basically um farm digestor

277
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,839
and menu digestor so our products are

278
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,399
called it's called the bio stream uh

279
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,279
what we have tried to do is try to

280
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,560
integrate the entire biogas upgrading

281
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,560
plant in a container so that uh the

282
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,199
installation cost the time to install

283
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,680
and the and the cost to install is

284
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,880
minimized and uh we are now deploying

285
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,360
these products um as I said as mostly in

286
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,040
the Midwest of the United States um so

287
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,199
we'll continue to work in the space um

288
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,560
the you know the first few years we saw

289
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,160
a lot of activity in landfills then it

290
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,120
followed then it was followed by farm

291
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,880
and manure digestors and now we are

292
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,079
seeing a transition to organic waste

293
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,240
diversion and a lot of companies like

294
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,880
the big retailers like the targets and

295
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,639
the

296
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,079
Walmarts uh and the Amazon are looking

297
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,760
at uh how to deal with organic waste um

298
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,199
and it's it's a pretty significant

299
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,839
number uh I think the number is 30 to

300
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:16,800
40% of all food product made in the US

301
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,560
is is wasted so there's a significant

302
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,040
amount of Bio source and the idea is to

303
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,360
take that and create uh Renewable Fuel

304
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,600
from that and so we're playing a I think

305
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,480
a significant role there so now let me

306
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,720
transition uh to the hydrogen space um

307
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,680
there was a lot of discussion today

308
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,120
about hydrogen um you know Green

309
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,839
hydrogen is there was presentations

310
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,800
about green hydrogen before and there's

311
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,959
there'll be a presentation after mine

312
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,480
about this um green hydrogen is a very

313
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:49,880
um good mechanism to make hydrogen uh

314
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,959
through electrolysis but a lot of the

315
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,160
economics Behind Green hydrogen depend

316
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,079
on the cost of the electron so in if the

317
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,639
cost of power is low green hydrogen

318
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,360
makes a lot of sense but if the cost of

319
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,519
power is high like in many regions of

320
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,839
the world um people are looking at other

321
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,720
sources of um low carbon hydrogen and

322
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,120
we've been working in a number of these

323
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,120
areas uh gasification is one taking bio

324
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,959
biosources and doing gasification or

325
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,800
pyrolysis uh people are looking at

326
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,079
pyrolysis of methane itself which which

327
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,720
they separate the hydrogen and the

328
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,440
carbon is collected as a as a as a

329
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,680
product and sold into the tire and the

330
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,800
paint industry uh um we have we have

331
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,480
done um again hydrogen production from

332
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,000
ammonia hydrogen production from

333
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,160
methanol these two are looked as

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,839
hydrogen carrier so when you either

335
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,839
crack the crack ammonia or the methanol

336
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,519
through reforming they requires

337
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,680
purification so uh all these various

338
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,279
mechanisms of making hydrogen require

339
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,160
some sort of gas purification whether

340
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,600
it's for industrial use or for you

341
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,600
purify to fuel C grate and we provide

342
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
our PSC technology for that uh we are

343
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,639
probably engaged with most of the

344
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,680
gasification companies around the world

345
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,639
in terms of producing uh compact small

346
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,959
scale uh PS

347
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,800
Solutions um one area which is

348
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,600
interesting is that there's a lot of

349
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,399
waste hydrogen produced from industrial

350
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,920
processes or from fuel cell systems that

351
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,800
are producing power and um there's a

352
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,639
desire to recover this waste hydrogen

353
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,240
because it is low cost and then reuse

354
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,319
that for different

355
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,120
applications one of the project that we

356
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:34,120
are involved with is in the Port of Long

357
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,880
Beach um this is a fuel cell energy fuel

358
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,160
cell system that's on site there that

359
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,959
produces power but also they have a

360
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,240
slipstream of uh gases that have a

361
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,440
significant amount of

362
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,839
hydrogen so what you're looking at here

363
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,839
is our PSA systems is a two-stage PSA we

364
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,880
take that gas stream we purify the

365
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,680
hydrogen and then that hydrogen is

366
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
actually sent to a fueling station on

367
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,600
site and the fuel cell cars and the fuel

368
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,839
cell trucks that come from Japan or

369
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,079
Korea or other locations when they come

370
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,759
to the Port of Long Beach that hydrogen

371
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,440
is used to fill those Vehicles so that

372
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
they can then go to the dealerships um

373
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,199
so there are there are many such

374
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,000
projects that we're involved with we

375
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,519
have deployed about 350 PSAs in the

376
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,319
hydrogen space over the last um last

377
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,759
decade or so um and and lastly you know

378
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,680
we do a lot of work um um in in the

379
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,920
renewable energy space but the same

380
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,880
technology is also used in u indust

381
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,360
industrial gases and and as an example

382
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,959
uh helium is a is a very um unique

383
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
commodity and the price of helium

384
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,639
fluctuates quite a bit but uhu um but we

385
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
are involved with u deploying between

386
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,880
four and five helium projects per year

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,240
uh in North America and what we do is we

388
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,160
work with an industrial gas company to

389
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,120
combine our PSA technology with a

390
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
membrane technology and produce high

391
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,360
high Purity helium for for the

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
semiconductor industry or other

393
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,240
industrial uses

394
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,839
um so that kind of gives you a quick

395
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,919
summary of the company I I mean we

396
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,880
obviously we've done uh work in many

397
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,959
different areas in terms of

398
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,039
possibilities of engaging uh engaging

399
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,319
with us I I I think um hydrogen and

400
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,839
biogas are core we do a lot of work

401
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,400
there um and we have commercial product

402
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,079
that we deploy so we look forward to any

403
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,120
uh inquiries surrounding that um in

404
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,280
terms of research and development and

405
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,440
and new products coming out um I would

406
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,760
say carbon capture is a space that U

407
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
we're looking at very carefully our

408
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
biogas product is actually is a carbon

409
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,640
capture product so we use the same

410
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,600
absorbant technology and the same

411
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,480
products uh to look at I would say not

412
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,120
very large scale carbon capture but

413
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,679
small scale from small factories

414
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,039
buildings uh we did a project with a

415
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,080
partner in New York City in Manhattan

416
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:56,000
there's a building in Manhattan which

417
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,120
has one of our systems at the b in the

418
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,159
boiler room and and they capture all the

419
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,480
carbon coming of the CO2 coming out of

420
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,440
the boiler system and then that's

421
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,600
liquefied and sent out to a a cement

422
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,440
manufacturing plant so um there are

423
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,559
opportunities like that where we can uh

424
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,440
we can do small scale CO2 capture from

425
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,919
point

426
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,760
sources uh but the more exciting thing I

427
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,039
think from a development point of view

428
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,320
is U we believe in circularity of

429
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,640
hydrogen CO2 and methane um there was a

430
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,039
discussion about CDR and I think we we

431
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,919
look at it as

432
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:32,120
cdrr is carbon dioxide removal and reuse

433
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,760
um so we looking at uh combining

434
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,520
hydrogen and CO2 to make methane that

435
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,120
can be injected back in the pipelines so

436
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,159
um methanization is not a new technology

437
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,960
it's been around for a while but it's

438
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:47,000
done at a very large scale in uh looks

439
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,120
like a plant uh what we are trying to do

440
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,640
is commercialize that as a product in a

441
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,480
containerized solution so uh there's a

442
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,039
lot of work related to heat heat

443
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,320
exchangers catalysis absorbance scoring

444
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,400
on metal

445
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,720
uh trying to make it almost like a fuel

446
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,840
cell stack or an electrolyzer stack but

447
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,280
looks and that does methanization so

448
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,880
that's an area we working with some

449
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,960
universities and U we look forward to

450
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,840
any engagement uh from the industry on

451
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,039
that space but um I'll stop here and

452
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,679
answer any questions that are

453
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:24,440
there thank you very much prau uh we do

454
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:27,280
have a few questions for you here um the

455
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:31,080
first one uh how do the economics

456
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,280
compare for the various sources of

457
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,480
hydrogen um I would say I mean you know

458
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,360
if you're following the hydrogen

459
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,640
industry over the last two or three

460
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,640
years there's been uh there's been

461
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,600
various way of classifying the hydrogen

462
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,080
and and uh and uh interestingly enough

463
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,039
there used a color scheme there's green

464
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,480
hydrogen there's blue hydrogen and

465
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:54,039
there's all types of shades of hydrogen

466
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,320
um when it comes to Green hydrogen as I

467
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,039
said the there's been a lot of work in

468
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,280
reducing the capital costs of the

469
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,400
electrolytes and I think uh there's good

470
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,440
progress there and we'll hear more about

471
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
it next um but I think the the driver

472
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,200
there is really the cost of power so if

473
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,320
you can get very low cost of power green

474
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,120
hydrogen becomes very attractive if not

475
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,080
then it's difficult to compete with with

476
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,480
blue hydrogen or other sources I think

477
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,559
people are looking a lot at gasification

478
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,440
today um I know we engage with probably

479
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,000
20 companies around the world that are

480
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,720
looking at various forms of gasification

481
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,200
I think there's some exciting things

482
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,600
happening there um I feel like uh um I

483
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,080
think over the next two or three years

484
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,480
we we'll see um out of the various

485
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,039
different Technologies some of them

486
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,200
succeeding and we can see gasification

487
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,600
based hydrogen being

488
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
competitive um I think the the other say

489
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,360
thing I would say is that people are

490
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,159
looking at ammonia and methanol is as a

491
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,799
as a hydrogen carrier so you make green

492
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,600
hydrogen or other forms of hydrogen and

493
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,799
use ammonia and meth ethanol um the

494
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,320
economics of that are not not clear yet

495
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,880
but I would I would think um right now I

496
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,120
would say green hydrogen with low cost

497
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,559
power or um hydrogen from gasifiers is

498
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,000
probably the two Pathways we look at and

499
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,480
then there's the obviously the

500
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,159
traditional making hydrogen from from

501
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,760
natural gas and capturing the carbon

502
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,279
that's probably also one of the

503
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,760
attractive batteries thank you um could

504
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:31,520
you tell us what's driving the bio gas

505
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:36,120
markets and the economics behind

506
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,240
them um I think the the driver is uh is

507
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,720
a renewable field standard right so it's

508
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,679
um um because of the requirements of the

509
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,039
uh the uh the refiners in they have to

510
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,200
buy a certain number of credits in terms

511
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,360
of renal fuel credits U that's so

512
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,640
there's the the RFS credits and then

513
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,120
there's the lcfs credits in California

514
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,200
and some other states in North America

515
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,960
so a combination of the two

516
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,240
is generating the demand for renewable

517
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,480
for RNG and there are some um you know

518
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,679
in some locations um the utilities

519
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,640
themselves are required to have a

520
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,480
certain percentage of uh renewable

521
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,159
natural gas in their pipelines um like

522
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,159
uh in some provinces in in Canada um and

523
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,000
that's driving a demand for RNG also so

524
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:27,279
those those utilities are then are able

525
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,200
to provide 10 15 20 or off oft

526
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,760
agreements to the Developers that I

527
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,240
think that's that's a strong driver okay

528
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,720
and um last question have you done any

529
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,600
projects in the carbon capture space and

530
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,880
how does your product fit uh in that

531
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,960
space um we've done a few um I think as

532
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
I said the most U interesting one that

533
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,880
we have done because you know our

534
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,760
product um is probably not suitable for

535
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,360
carbon capture from a utility from a

536
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,000
power plant or for a cement plant uh but

537
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,120
it's more uh small scale industry

538
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and U and buildings so um one of the

539
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,679
most exciting projects that we did a

540
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,320
couple of years ago is as I said it's a

541
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,799
it's a residential building in Manhattan

542
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,080
and and there are some

543
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,480
legislative um requirements that are

544
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,799
driving some of these projects in

545
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:23,880
Manhattan or New York um and what we did

546
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:27,240
is we we um put in our um carbon capture

547
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,279
solution in a in a in a boiler room of a

548
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,480
building and we take all the exhaust gas

549
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:35,279
from their heating system and we

550
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,039
separate the CO2 from that and that then

551
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:41,200
CO2 is liquefied and taken out to a

552
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:44,919
cement manufacturer who uses CO2 uh to

553
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,559
create for for manufacturing of cement

554
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,919
um so that's one of the exciting things

555
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,679
I uh it's a very unique um project and

556
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,799
the reason why we are able to do it is

557
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,320
because how compact our PSA is and

558
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,039
that's the fast cycle PSA enables you to

559
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,520
do that I think if uh they economics of

560
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,960
that project are successful there's um

561
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,679
there's demand for that um and I think

562
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,480
um obviously from a regulations point of

563
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,559
view um the state of New York is pushing

564
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,080
that I think if you're successful there

565
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:16,480
I suspect that that will uh that the

566
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,240
same regulations will be looked at

567
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
probably in other parts of the

568
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,600
world okay thank you rabu thank you

569
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,360
