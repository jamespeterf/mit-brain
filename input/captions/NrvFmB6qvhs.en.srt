1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,319
All right, good morning and good

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,960
afternoon for those of us who are

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,960
joining from overseas. Um, and even good

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,080
evening as well. I'm Trisha Dinkl and

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm with the MIT Startup Exchange which

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
is an integrated program resource within

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
MIT ILP and it's an honor to be here

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
this morning and to introduce the MIT

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Startup presentations. Today you'll be

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
hearing from two startup companies, Muan

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,600
Vision and Fieldstone Bio. And both of

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,599
the presenting startups are part of the

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,519
MIT Startup Exchange and are developing

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
critical technologies and services that

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,040
address both the challenges and the

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,880
emerging innovations for mining and

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,320
resource recovery. So with this

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
selection of startups, we want to give

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
you an idea of the technologies that are

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,640
emerging from MIT that are advancing the

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
mining industry. Each startup

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,879
presentation will be followed by its own

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,800
brief audience Q&A. So I encourage you

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,039
to ask your questions into the Q&A

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
field. uh throughout the respective

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
presentations. If you'd like to connect

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
with either of the startup presenters

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
following the webinar, you can reach out

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
to me directly. I'll put my contact

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
information into the chat field or you

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
can ask your ILP program director

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
because that's what we do at Startup

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,560
Exchange and ILP. MIT Startup Exchange

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
brings together MIT connected startups

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
and ILP corporate members to foster this

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,200
collaboration and partnerships between

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
them. The startups that we support all

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,479
have a strong connection with the

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,000
institute. This connection can come

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,400
through the founding team or the

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
technology. In other cases, startups who

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
don't have an origin at MIT, but because

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,799
they're vetted and supported by MIT

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,040
peers, we assess them for MIT startup

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,920
exchange. So, examples of MIT peers

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,600
could be Cale Connect Plus, Start.no,

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
The Engine, and their respective startup

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,799
portfolios. Today, we have a network of

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,640
over 800 startups virtually working in

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
any sector. And we are also

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,600
geographically agnostic engaging with

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,759
MIT uh MIT connected startups

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,079
headquartered anywhere in the world.

54
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,560
Everything MIT startup exchange does is

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,720
to expose and connect startups and ILP

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,640
industry members in a highly curated

57
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,240
way. So this includes launching calls

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,719
for startups on corporate's own

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,159
challenges and priority or facilitating

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,560
one-on-one meetings between both

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
parties, hosting virtual demo days and

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
other events and learning opportunities

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,280
where we can typically co-organize them

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,000
with our MIT peers such as the Martin

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,879
Center, Martin Trust Center, E14 or

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,120
venture mentoring service. right here

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,800
just a very small brief snapshot of the

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,879
success cases we've had to date that

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,120
includes proof proof of concepts uh

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,040
pilots joint development acquisitions

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
and it's the intent with every event

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
every meeting every introduction to

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
produce the valuable connections that

74
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,200
will ultimately lead to its own success

75
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,959
case so now on to the startup

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
presentations each company will be

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,879
presenting for seven minutes followed by

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,040
a threeminut Q&A so be sure to ask your

79
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
questions
