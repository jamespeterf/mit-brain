1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,719
this is a short video following up on

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,720
the unlocking of pitches where we will

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,400
unlock duration and note objects in

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,160
music 21 go ahead and start up your

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,160
Jupiter notebook and let's get

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,960
programming start with durations um so

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,320
go ahead and from music 21 import

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,920
duration and um that thing we've just

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,000
imported duration is it um put a thumbs

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,000
up if it's an object put a thumbs down

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,280
if you think it's a

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,600
module okay so in this case it is a

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,920
module there if you didn't get it right

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,199
no worries because there's no way you

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,840
can actually tell just from that except

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,280
for by convention python by convention

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,079
we write our modules in lowercase we can

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,479
see that it's a module by um taking it

19
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:09,040
type Yay good i'' be terrible if I

20
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,799
didn't within um the module there is uh

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,400
usually an object with the same name as

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,479
it I hit Tab and I get oh there is a

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,360
duration object so we'll create one

24
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,560
assign it to D and I'm going to create a

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,439
duration of

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,400
3.0 what I want you to do is open up the

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,320
chat and don't um don't yet hit iner on

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,680
it but if you could put what you think

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,680
3.0 might

30
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,320
represent yep so we have a lot of um a

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,000
lot of Beats going on um some I like

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
qualification with some standard of how

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,200
long a beat is um and we also have

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,280
dotted half and things like that nobody

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
seems to like our favorite uh thing

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,880
milliseconds maybe if I had had

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,920
purposely made my thing um

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,000
3,000 than than people would have

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,159
thought that um you know but it is a

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
float it could be seconds or something

41
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,760
uh in this case we'll figure it out um

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
well okay that doesn't tell us much of

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,760
anything and um what we can do is we can

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,599
get the full name of this and see it is

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,280
a dotted half so um it could be beat

46
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:31,000
still I'll just go ahead and say in

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,840
music 21 I made the decision to have um

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,879
the number represent the number of

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,360
quarter notes uh I may over time I have

50
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,120
sometimes regretted that decision um but

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,720
it had to be something and one of the

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,239
reasons I decided not to go with half uh

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,599
with Beats is that um the length the

54
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,760
representation of a note in terms of

55
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,640
Beats is dependent on something external

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,440
and that is the ti signature right so 22

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,159
has a different number of Beats from 68

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,480
has a different number uh has a

59
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,319
different type of beat from 68 which has

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,040
a different type of beat from 44 so

61
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,599
that's um that's one of the reasons uh

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,560
going with this so every um every

63
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,599
duration object has a full name it also

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,799
has a

65
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:25,319
type half and uh has a dots it's great

66
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,959
um it also a something called quarter

67
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,760
length which in this case um is yeah the

68
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,760
number of quarters and that's not so bad

69
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,439
but maybe uh I mean that's something you

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,560
already knew how to do but maybe we do

71
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,799
we can create a duration in a different

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:46,720
way we'll say type equals whole and dots

73
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:49,760
equals 4 and suddenly the quarter

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,400
length of this is a little bit harder to

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,439
compute anybody on off the top of their

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,519
head right you're all too shy to say

77
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,560
7.75 okay good well I don't I don't know

78
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,560
that number okay so here are some of the

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:09,760
things that that we can um that we can

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,599
do can we um can we create a a triplet

81
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,599
let's try

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,120
that one onethird of a note so what kind

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
of a triplet is that somebody shout it

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:30,600
out an e triplet let's let's see type

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,280
yay triplet so we can create trip blits

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,120
um notice we'll go back to D here um

87
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,520
notice that some durations are expressed

88
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,320
in floats some are expressed in rational

89
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,000
fractions and that tells you whether or

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,840
not um you're going to safely be able to

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720
add them up and get an exact number uh

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,320
anything that's a multiple of a power of

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,720
two in binary will be exactly

94
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,440
representable anything that isn't will

95
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,560
be here so great so trip type is

96
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,639
eth so it doesn't tell me anything about

97
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,440
it its dots I hope are zero there's no

98
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,960
dots there great um so there is

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,240
something

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,759
called tuplets which a tuplet is a type

101
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,080
of U like a quadruplet a quintuplet

102
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
triplet is the one we most know great

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,000
what I want you to do is take a second

104
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,360
and put in the chat what kind of object

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,080
was just returned from um

106
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,600
tuplets okay have um a couple different

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,000
uh different answers but most people say

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,800
it's a tuple right a tle of tuplets

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,759
which you Tred not to say that she many

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,600
times fast and you know it's a tupple um

111
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,560
because it has this comma at the end so

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,319
um it's an immutable a list of it and

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,520
that means there you can have more than

114
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,400
one tolet so you might have a triplet

115
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,440
within a triplet and so on so those are

116
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,479
some things we can do um

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,160
the top so we can get at that darn tolet

118
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,880
object I'm just trying to pull it out

119
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,039
pull it out uh oh right it's not a

120
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,960
graphical environment so um we'll get

121
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,440
the first one we'll call it

122
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:22,240
t and we'll see that the tuplet itself

123
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,520
is also a complex object we can dir it

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,680
and we can see it has certain things

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,160
like tuplet multiplier which I happen to

126
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,360
know is a meth

127
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,199
and so we can see that when you throw

128
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,199
this tuplet onto a note that note

129
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,639
becomes 2/3 of its previous here are

130
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,639
just some of the things you can do you

131
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:47,639
will learn this in um in music in um the

132
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,319
music 21 users guide two and three which

133
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,759
we'll get through in a bit um some of

134
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,800
the things you might see are

135
00:06:52,759 --> 00:07:00,000
um duration

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,120
that obviously four is a whole people

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,879
who like these things eight is a dotted

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,120
a double whole note also called a brieve

139
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,120
um which means short because there used

140
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,879
to be longer notes and they're still

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,960
somewhere and that's the longest

142
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,120
possible note U which no longer exists

143
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,120
except that somebody used a double the

144
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,120
longest possible note but then at a

145
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,440
certain point you can't do it similarly

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,520
on the small side you can go

147
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,840
um and let's get the type of

148
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:38,840
that notice that the type of an eighth

149
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:42,479
note is e i g h t the type of a 16th

150
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:47,199
note um I misspelled 16th too many times

151
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,879
so I decided U We Go From Here uh I

152
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,599
don't think I know my fractions below

153
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,080
that so we'll just keep going like that

154
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,240
you can go down pretty far let's skip a

155
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:03,159
bit oops or

156
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,960
16 and you can go down to 14 20 1 24

157
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,120
notes theoretically notes go on forever

158
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,360
but

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:16,319
um music 21 at a certain point says yeah

160
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,240
this isn't representation music great I

161
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,440
want to do um one more little exercise

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,319
and this is a this is a trick question

163
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,440
so just put um put your head what you

164
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,879
think I'm going to sing something to you

165
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,879
and you tell me how many notes I sang

166
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,120
yes I sang a eighth note tied to a 32nd

167
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,760
note was slightly longer than half of a

168
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,880
beat in my head so how do we deal with

169
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,360
things like that well let's make it a

170
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,279
whole note tied to a quarter note let's

171
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
say the duration was fast so I'll call

172
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,000
that an odd uh thing and by the way

173
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,800
thank you one thank everybody for saying

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,279
one and not saying seven because of you

175
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,120
warbles too much but um let's take that

176
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:05,279
uh eighth note tied to a 30 second note

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,279
uh what is that

178
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,560
125 so we can see that you can create

179
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:16,120
things and this says it's complex it is

180
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,079
a duration that has multiple what I call

181
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,200
components um which that there's an

182
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,279
eighth and um an eighth and the 32nd

183
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,880
that are put together and so what we

184
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:31,640
mean by the length of a note will depend

185
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,839
on where a note splits will depend on

186
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:38,440
the context that we want to use it so if

187
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,760
we're thinking about um hey he just

188
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,959
saying that note in a sound context in a

189
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,360
recording context obviously that's one

190
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,560
note there's there's no other way around

191
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,680
it but if we're thinking about it in a

192
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,240
notation context and you're writing

193
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,399
something that has to draw notes on a

194
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,920
page you're going to want to put say

195
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,040
that well that's actually two notes

196
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,839
because there's no way to represent the

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,800
duration that we heard with just one

198
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,519
note so some of the things we're going

199
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,279
to be working on this class is how do we

200
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,839
move from different represent one

201
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,640
representation to another so that um

202
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,120
we're always using the

203
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,040
representation that is most appropriate

204
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,399
for the situation and so we'll spend a

205
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,800
lot of time in this class um working on

206
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,160
translations among

207
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:33,640
representations okay remember you can

208
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:35,920
always um take the directory of um of a

209
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,360
music 21 or any python object to get

210
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,760
some more things about it um but you can

211
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,000
also uh in Jupiter you can put in

212
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,279
question mark afterwards and get some

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,360
docs or look at the Docks so now you

214
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,680
have unlocked pitches and you have

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,680
unlocked

216
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,079
durations let's um move on to the last

217
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,399
thing that we want that we're going to

218
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,320
unlock today and that is those are

219
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,120
notes

220
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,040
so there are a million ways we could

221
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,720
have called something a note um we could

222
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,040
say um you know a note is the same thing

223
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,160
as a pitch some people say that whatever

224
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,760
but here's how I have chosen um and with

225
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:26,880
my uh advisors and stuff how to

226
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:29,040
represent a note a note takes in sort of

227
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,639
a string just like a pitch just like we

228
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,000
saw the pitch video um it's called a

229
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:40,200
note it doesn't print the octave for

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,160
some reason but and it has a name just

231
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,959
like uh just like a pitch does but it

232
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:50,680
also all those things are in a stored

233
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:54,240
pitch object so a note has a pitch

234
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:59,560
object and so you could change that and.

235
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:04,360
pitch. octave equals 4

236
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:07,200
see all that um but a note also has a

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,839
duration and so in this case the default

238
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,160
all notes start off with the duration of

239
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,639
one quarter note I don't know why I'm

240
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,360
privileging quarter notes but somehow I

241
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,320
have um we can change the quarter length

242
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,360
of that

243
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,160
3.5 and

244
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,320
then well has a full name so we can look

245
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,399
at this be flat in octave 4 Double

246
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,959
dotted half note okay so that's all

247
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,320
there um hopefully this is working one

248
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,480
cool thing that you can do that you

249
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,160
can't do with a pitch or duration really

250
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,800
is you can show a note it's weird that

251
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,440
the first time it always takes longer

252
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,000
and then later so here we go we have a

253
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,639
particular note it figures out some kind

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,560
of context for it has a couple other

255
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,320
things we can do we can change the note

256
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:01,560
head to be an X we can change the note

257
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,240
to be no red I'm slightly color blind so

258
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,160
I can't really see the difference but

259
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:12,959
you can tell me that

260
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:16,399
works yep and um we can also make it

261
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,720
into a complex note so I think we

262
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,120
learned

263
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,920
6.25 couldn't be represented normally

264
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,600
but we can see that um music 21 will

265
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,120
figure out how many notes are necessary

266
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
to represent it on the staff

267
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,600
there's other miscellaneous

268
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,880
things you can give it a

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:45,959
lyric and so on so uh again everything

270
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,519
there is in the during it and you'll see

271
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,040
there's a lot of stuff and we're going

272
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,720
to get through um a good chunk of

273
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,040
looking these things

274
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,440
later no you will not be ever quizzed on

275
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,839
okay what does purge orphans mean on a

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,560
note so it's not that kind of class but

277
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,920
but we want you to um I want you to feel

278
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,959
free play around with this play with

279
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,279
anything except just like with pitch

280
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:18,120
anything that begins with transpose is

281
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:20,880
off limits um only because uh it'll make

282
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,720
the problem set where we uh do a lot of

283
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,279
things with intervals a lot less fun

284
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:33,639
because you're not using anyhow uh this

285
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,639
is the end of the locking for topic one
