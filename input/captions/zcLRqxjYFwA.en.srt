1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,080
welcome everyone um my name is ABI yadav

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,960
um a co-founder and CEO of I customer uh

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,280
I'm in MIT slan MBA

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,039
2013 uh so excited to be here and thanks

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,840
for having us uh to present uh I

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,640
customer story we call ourself a

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,080
decision intelligence company um which

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,119
is basically a very laser focused on

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,000
helping Enterprise and midmarket

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:35,520
customer to do GTM transformation

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,879
with GTM we mean go to market um and I'm

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,600
going to tell you a little bit on that

13
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:45,800
uh in some of my rest of slide so go to

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,000
market uh is a two trillion Money Pit

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,640
it's a huge problem uh lots of

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,760
categories here a lot of noise in this

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,280
space lot of business call it different

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,199
names different thing but ultimately it

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,559
all tracks down to who my customer is

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,320
and you know helping them manage

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,799
customer data chaos and fragmentation is

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:14,840
what is costing businesses more than 15%

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,240
of their revenue uh year on year um what

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,240
what every business end up doing is

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,840
mostly around you know doing a lot of

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,960
marketing dollar lot of brand awareness

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,040
lot of lead gen lot of AD media spin

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,360
primarily basically to create more what

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,000
we call F all positive signal Loop which

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,520
is may not be relevant but it's more of

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
like uh basically to put out the name

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,439
out there in the name of marketing um

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,880
the a lot of solutions which exist to

34
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,680
buying signals data things like that a

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,880
lot of companies also spend lot of money

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,079
in terms of investing in data platform

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,399
and orchestration things like that so

38
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,399
there's a lot of Mumble tumble out there

39
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,640
uh mostly the challenge comes down from

40
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,440
this high level strategic challenges to

41
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,000
more tactical the current Solutions are

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,680
mostly very

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,040
self-service which are human dependent

44
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,200
requires a lot of work in terms of

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,920
setting up

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,760
data in set up Insight you know which

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,800
which is why there are a lot of

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,040
disconnection both in terms of Data

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,360
Insights and action um which leads to

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,480
very higher C

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,360
uh cost of customer acquisition lower

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,040
LTB and kind of lower Loi Roi in terms

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,800
of the marketing dollar and this is a

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,959
rampant problem um across a lot of

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,040
businesses which is have invested a lot

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,599
in terms of targeted marketing and

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,440
database marketing and you know I had

58
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:58,200
invested in this uh holy triology of you

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,879
know um data and customer data

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,840
intelligence system um so the way we

61
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,879
sort of addressing this is leveraging

62
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,080
agentic AI uh which is a right

63
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,680
triangulation between what we call is

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,840
from you know um a sort of a false

65
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,560
signal Loop to a GTM decision and

66
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,840
optimization Loop and the way to shift

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,560
this and we'll explain more in general

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,200
but we basically help um customer kind

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
of match their data set between

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,720
different sies

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,480
unlock a lot of intelligence create this

72
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,680
reinforcement self-learning loop on

73
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,959
their existing named customer data uh

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,439
instead of like chasing a whole bunch of

75
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,640
different database the way we do this is

76
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,080
primarily um these are like three

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,840
pillars of our solution match decide and

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,799
activate where we actually help them you

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,120
know within their environment we'll show

80
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,560
you in a second within their environment

81
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,239
without moving away out their data from

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,519
their data warehouse or their CDP MDM we

83
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,000
help them build their ontology real

84
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,799
world data enrichment Universal matching

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,280
things like that um we help them enable

86
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,600
bring their own model uh and

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,560
productionize them uh and then we have

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,960
these agentic Playbook which are

89
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,360
basically best practice playbook in

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,280
terms of data decision engine which are

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,280
like helpful for customer acquisition

92
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,560
retention you name it um from you know

93
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,960
built on kind of various best practices

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,840
built on various kind of speed to value

95
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,240
and which has like more decision Loop in

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,639
general um

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,280
visually it works out like this where

98
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,240
you know we basically sit on top of any

99
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,039
data warehouse or MDM or any first party

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,000
data set and we have this unique open

101
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,360
graph situation where we have our

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,280
immutable IDs which helps them in

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,280
matching and creating this knowledge

104
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,360
graph um and then sort of helping the

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,080
agent take

106
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,160
activation uh with human in Loop which

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,320
are mostly goal oriented workflows

108
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:22,400
instead of existing linear workflows

109
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,800
which we see it um so most of the the

110
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,400
top three key use cases which we have

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,880
currently in production where there are

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,600
customers which are using us for

113
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,840
customer life cycle

114
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,080
orchestration uh or goal oriented

115
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,120
personalization um there's a lot of AD

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,880
targeting enablement we also do in a

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,360
central basis so if you assume yourself

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,560
sitting on customer data and you could

119
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,759
segment it uh centrally but then

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,039
activate it in different attech marktech

121
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,560
in the way um is needed for a lot of

122
00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:00,319
control experiments um that's what we

123
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,560
enable one quick case study I'd like to

124
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,720
talk about is U this is for a large

125
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,160
e-commerce cpg player um who has been

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,039
using this more as an you know a next

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,599
space thing Beyond bi where we actually

128
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,400
helping them not just identify what is

129
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,199
really going on in their customer data

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,000
but also like what's the root cause

131
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,160
analysis and how to improve this all

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,360
enabled through you know kind of simple

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,039
UI and uh for more business friendly in

134
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,599
the language they they understand um the

135
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,120
traction has been solid we already have

136
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:42,960
we're about a year old we already have

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,440
uh 22 plus Enterprise customer mostly

138
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,479
the kpi is around Ros CAC

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,000
Roi um the time to Value we get enabled

140
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,800
to some of our clients is mostly around

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,080
you know 90 days um so here's my ask

142
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,720
which is seeking customer Innovation

143
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,240
partner

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,479
uh pilot programs trying to get you know

145
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,680
time to Value into 90 days um and then

146
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,360
we have experts around Finance Pharma

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,400
manufacturing um I'm around this is my

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,120
name email happy to connect to LinkedIn

149
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,840
um and you know answer any further

150
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,319
question thanks so much ABI um again

151
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,080
everyone please post your questions to

152
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,599
the Q&A Tab and we can ask them here for

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,360
everyone um let me ask you you you

154
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,879
mentioned self-service and your action

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,919
plan so how long is that time to value

156
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:40,000
for your typical

157
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:43,160
customer yeah so um we the first use

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,319
case uh activation we do that normally

159
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,759
within the 90 days and this is for the

160
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,879
Enterprise setting where assuming we

161
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,599
were sitting on somebody's customer data

162
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,680
access and it's a simple readon access

163
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,680
it happens within their environment um

164
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,199
we already had build integration with in

165
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
data breakes snowflakes and real these

166
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,720
are like common data platform where we

167
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,199
can get started and show value within 60

168
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,000
to 90 days great and the um the

169
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,919
customers have to move their data how

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,280
does that

171
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,560
work so

172
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,440
um no the answer is no um we are not a

173
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,159
data platform we call ourselves decision

174
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,120
intelligence primally to get the data

175
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:35,240
chaos into to like activating that data

176
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,440
into for more you know relevant use

177
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,080
cases for a specific goal uh instead of

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,560
random orchestration or random

179
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,080
activation and which is actually

180
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,000
happening within their warehouse we do

181
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,160
have enabling a lot of integration where

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,120
they have to um give like act activation

183
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,720
access but the data stays within their

184
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,000
environment you know this can be

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,560
dockerized it could be deployed within

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,560
their um their environment set okay

187
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,560
thank you so much
