1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,279
Uh today we have a special uh guest

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,279
lecturer uh professor Andrew Loe. A lot

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,920
of you may have already know uh

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,840
professor Low, but I still will make a

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,239
quick uh introduction.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:37,360
So, Professor Low is um professor at the

7
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,360
MIT Sloan Business School uh for many

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,879
years. He's also the director of uh the

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,760
laboratory for financial engineering and

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,000
uh uh a principal investigator with MIT

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
CEL which is the computer science and

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,680
artificial intelligence uh lab.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,600
uh he also has many uh other active uh

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,520
involvement with uh uh say just a couple

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,880
of examples Santa Fe Institute and uh uh

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,119
MBER which is uh national bureau of uh

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,159
economical research

18
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,600
um and uh professor Los's research areas

19
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,159
are very broad too so I think it will be

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,159
too long for me to uh read through them

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,400
I think instead of that I will pass it

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
on to uh professor low for the today's

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
lecture.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
>> All right. Great. Thanks very much,

25
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,880
Jake. Um thank you, Peter, for inviting

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,040
me to 16 or 18642.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,600
Uh happy to be here and um I'm going to

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,159
be talking to you about um some big

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,360
ideas and some big challenges uh

30
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,399
particularly for your generation because

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,640
um uh our generation has created the

32
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
problems that your generation is going

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,119
to need to deal with. And so what I'm

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
hoping to do today is also to give you

35
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,399
some of the tools by which you could

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,880
deal with some of those problems.

37
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,840
Problems like climate change, like

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,040
dealing with cancer, uh various kinds of

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,239
uh energy demands that are growing uh

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,879
exponentially even as we speak. So by

41
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,400
background um I'm a financial economist

42
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,080
by training and trade. Um got my PhD at

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,239
Harvard in economics, financial

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
economics. uh then ended up teaching at

45
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
the Wharton School and for the last 35

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
years I've been teaching at MIT at the

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,599
Sloan School in the finance group and

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,480
when I teach my first year MBAs in

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,640
finance I start off by telling them

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,599
finance is the most important subject

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,959
you will ever take at a business school

52
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,879
and you know I acknowledge that my other

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,599
colleagues in departments like

54
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,840
accounting and marketing uh operations

55
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
research they may feel the same way

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,160
about their subject but the key

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,040
difference is that in my case I happen

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
to be right and and the reason is

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,200
because no matter what you do, no matter

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
what field you go into, no matter what

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,319
industry you choose for your job, at

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
some point or another, when you want to

63
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,920
do something really important, really

64
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,720
transformative,

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,640
you will need money and at that point

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
you will be speaking my language. you

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
will need to understand the basics of

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,360
financial analysis, things like cost of

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,800
capital, net present value calculations

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,560
and so on. So in this very short and

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,440
compressed lecture, I'm going to give

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
you an exposure to all of those concepts

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,599
in the context of dealing with some of

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
society's biggest issues and I'm going

75
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,599
to focus on two in particular. One is in

76
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,080
biio medicine and the other is going to

77
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,920
be in energy particularly fusion energy.

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,159
So let me first start with an

79
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,480
observation on the first set of examples

80
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,319
and that is that that biio medicine is

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
at an inflection point. Now some of you

82
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,480
who are biology majors you know this

83
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
actually do we have any biology majors

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
here in this class? Anybody doing

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,040
anything in bioengineering? How about

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,080
chemical engineering, chemistry?

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,599
>> Okay. Okay. All right. Well, people do

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,640
math and other subjects. But anyway, um

89
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,799
it turns out that in biio medicine,

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,640
things are different than they've ever

91
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
been in the history of the field. And

92
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm going to give you two examples of

93
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,799
that. The first example has to do with

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,479
these two kids, Caroline and Cole

95
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,720
Carper. They were born with a rare

96
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,080
condition known as lib's congenital

97
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,000
amorosis. It's a single gene mutation, a

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,000
typo in your DNA that causes blindness

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,400
starting at birth. You're born with a

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
normal pair of eyes, but this mutation

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
prevents your eyes from producing a very

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
important protein. And without the

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
protein, you start to go blind. So, by

104
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,759
the time you're six months old, you are

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,600
legally blind from that point on. And so

106
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,199
these two kids were part of a clinical

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,040
trial in 2016 started by a

108
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,000
Philadelphiabased drug company called

109
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,560
Spark Therapeutics that used a really

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,880
remarkable therapy to try to deal with

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,759
their genetic mutation.

112
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,400
It's a treatment known as gene therapy.

113
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,039
And the way it works is this.

114
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,240
You take the correct version of the gene

115
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,280
that these two kids don't have. You

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,600
insert it into a virus and then you

117
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,479
inject the virus into the back of the

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,639
eyes of these two kids. One time

119
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,360
injection.

120
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,840
And what happens is the virus infects

121
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,600
the cells and takes the correct gene and

122
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
swaps it with the incorrect version

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,039
in those cells. And from that point

124
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,720
forward, these kids cells in the back of

125
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,880
their eyes start producing this protein.

126
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,680
And let me tell you what Caroline said a

127
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,520
few days after she received the

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
injection.

129
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,199
I went outside when it was snowing and I

130
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
was like, "Oh, I can see the

131
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,840
snowflakes." It was really cool to

132
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,600
actually see something that I've never

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:06,400
seen in my life before.

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,840
One time injection. and now she can see.

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,600
The second example has to do with um a

136
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,000
disease known as Canavan disease. So

137
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,000
this is also a single gene mutation, a

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,080
typo. And what this disease does is

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,919
pretty subtle.

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,560
it um prevents your nerve cells from

141
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:34,080
being able to maintain the myelin sheath

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,919
that basically provides the insulation

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,520
for that nerve cell. Now, you all know

144
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,680
that nerve cells have a nucleus and

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,600
they've got an axon, right? this long

146
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,639
long um string that conducts electricity

147
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,840
and allows you to basically take an

148
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,960
impulse and transmit it to various parts

149
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,520
of your body. And the purpose of this

150
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,639
myelin myelin is a kind of fat, right?

151
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,039
The purpose of this fatty sheath that

152
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,560
goes on the outside of every nerve cell

153
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,960
is insulation. It's like a wire that has

154
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
to have some kind of insulation to

155
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,759
prevent the electrical

156
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
impulses to cross to other wires. When

157
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,720
that happens, you get short circuits.

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,400
And obviously, that's a bad thing. But

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,919
turns out that kids with this single

160
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,319
gene mutation after they're born, the

161
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
myelin sheets in their body begin to

162
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,080
degrade. And so the electrical impulses

163
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,560
start to shortcircuit. And so you have a

164
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,199
hard time controlling your muscles. And

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,440
so generally these kids have a lifespan

166
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:46,319
of about 10 to 12 years. Uh this is a an

167
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,160
example of a Canavan patient. Um he's

168
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,120
probably uh uh close to his end of life.

169
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,840
Um they generally don't grow beyond uh

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,520
15 just because it's becomes harder and

171
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
harder to control your breathing, your

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,160
heartbeat. All of the bodily functions

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,400
that we take for granted become much

174
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
more difficult in canavan patients.

175
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
You'll notice that that he's leaned back

176
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
on his wheelchair. The reason is that

177
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,440
his head tends to be larger than normal.

178
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,840
This hi hypo hyper uh uh incphily your

179
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,160
head gets bigger uh is part of the

180
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,919
symptom of the disease. And at some

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
point your neck because there's no

182
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,680
muscle tone because you can't use the

183
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,240
muscles because of the nerve impulses

184
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,960
that get shortcircuited. Um it's very

185
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,800
easy to snap the neck if you just lean

186
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,959
over like this. And so you have to

187
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,200
always be in a prone position uh and

188
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,959
your head protected by um by these

189
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,519
cushions.

190
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,360
There's lots of other terrible symptoms.

191
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
Uh let me tell you what they are.

192
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,240
Children with canniban disease cannot

193
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,080
crawl, cannot walk, cannot sit or talk.

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,320
Over time they may suffer seizures,

195
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,640
become paralyzed, eventually delayed,

196
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,440
blind, and have trouble swallowing.

197
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,600
Deafness may also result. Many children

198
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,760
do not live past the age of 10 and at

199
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
present time there is no cure for

200
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
canavan disease. Treatment involves

201
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,440
managing the symptoms

202
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,920
and so the typical canavan patient the

203
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
disease uh generally affects you

204
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,200
starting at birth but in some cases it

205
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,040
ca it can be get progressively worse uh

206
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,279
over time.

207
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,200
the the doctors that know how to

208
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,240
diagnose this disease typically what

209
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,320
they tell their parents is go home and

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,440
love your child.

211
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,000
That's their treatment. That's it.

212
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,000
That's all they can do.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
So it turns out that you can treat this

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
disease using the same technique gene

215
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,640
therapy. take the correct version of the

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,519
gene, put it into a virus, inject the

217
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,959
virus, in this case into the brains uh

218
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,320
of these Canavan patients. And well, I'm

219
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,120
going to show you um a video clip of

220
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,080
what happens with one particular

221
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,760
patient. This is patient number three, I

222
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,120
believe. And what you're going to see is

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,920
a clinical trial of the uh patient

224
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
before the treatment after she's

225
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,680
diagnosed. So they know that she's got

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,519
this mutation.

227
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,279
You can see the symptoms that are

228
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,680
developing. And and the frustrating

229
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,320
thing is that you are born relatively

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,360
normal, but because your body can't

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,519
maintain the myelin sheets, you begin to

232
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,920
degenerate over a period of time. So um

233
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,720
let me show you uh what's going on here.

234
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,160
So this is June 2022, just before the

235
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,000
treatment.

236
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,120
>> So this is the uh um patient.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
>> You eating your blueberries?

238
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,240
>> And she's about one year old. And so at

239
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,600
this age, you should be able to move

240
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,399
around, but look at her hand motions and

241
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
how jerky her control is. She It's going

242
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,800
to take her quite a while just to grab

243
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
one blueberry and put it in her mouth.

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,880
So this is going to get much much worse

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,212
at this particular um rate of of uh

246
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,800
degeneration. Now this is uh

247
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,680
[clears throat]

248
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
about 6 months after that one time

249
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,000
injection.

250
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
>> Wow. Look at you trucking along. Come

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
on.

252
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
>> She's actually walking.

253
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,920
>> Even though it's with a uh a walker,

254
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,040
>> she's actually walk now. You can tell

255
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,079
>> recovery.

256
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
>> She can't walk on her own yet. you

257
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
strong.

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,399
>> But this is only six months after the

259
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,920
treatment. Okay.

260
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,600
>> Now, this is just around the same time.

261
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,040
>> She is now getting ready to actually

262
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,360
stand on her own.

263
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,600
>> And this uses an enormous amount of core

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,760
muscles. You probably all know you have

265
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
to exercise your core. So, she's

266
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,279
developing core muscle strength. It's

267
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,640
it's it's

268
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,160
>> quite She can't quite do it yet, but

269
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,680
she's close. Very close. And

270
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,800
>> there you go. [laughter]

271
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,720
There she goes. She's just about to do

272
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,640
it. That's it. For the very first time,

273
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,680
she actually stood up on her own.

274
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,720
Amazing. Now, this is a month after

275
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
that,

276
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,880
>> she is walking without the walker. She

277
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,720
can't do it all on her own yet because

278
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,600
remember, it's only been about seven or

279
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,839
eight months since her body is able to

280
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,720
deal with this myelin sheath problem.

281
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,279
>> But way better.

282
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,000
Now, this is about nine months later.

283
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,760
She's on a bike. [crying]

284
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,240
>> Extraordinary. And she's motioning to

285
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,440
her dad to give her a push and to help

286
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,399
her out.

287
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,519
>> And here she is uh just a few months ago

288
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,240
this year. So, this is now about a year

289
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,720
and 3 months after that that dose of

290
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,200
gene therapy. She's about to be able to

291
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,040
walk on her own for the very first time.

292
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,040
There has been no canniban patient in

293
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,480
the history of the disease that has ever

294
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,440
been able to do this. Got it,

295
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
>> girl.

296
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
>> And so this is remarkable,

297
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,720
>> remarkable uh progress.

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,720
>> Can you believe it?

299
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,959
>> Thank you, honey.

300
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,160
>> She is actually reading now. She's

301
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,880
starting to learn the letters of the

302
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,279
alphabet and she's responsive. She can

303
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,600
actually interact. This This is

304
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,320
extraordinary.

305
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
The blind shall see, the lame shall

306
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
walk. You know, that's a phrase that we

307
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
usually associate with religious

308
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
experiences.

309
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,079
But it's happening. It's happening now

310
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,760
thanks to the miracles that are being

311
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,279
developed by these scientists and

312
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,959
clinicians.

313
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,839
And our colleagues uh Phil Sharp, Susan

314
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:38,079
Hawkfield, and Tyler Jax, they published

315
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,600
a paper uh in 2016 to describe this new

316
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,760
world that we're living in. They call it

317
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
convergence. the convergence of the life

318
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
sciences, physical sciences, and

319
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,240
engineering. All of these fields are

320
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,120
coming together to be able to do things

321
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,480
that people were not able to do before.

322
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,880
The other term that people in biio

323
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,440
medicine use is the OMIX revolution. All

324
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,600
of these OMICs have experienced

325
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,279
tremendous progress over the last even

326
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,040
five years, never mind 10 or 20. and um

327
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,360
you know genomics the science of

328
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,279
sequencing your genes. Epigenomics, the

329
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,720
onoff switches that cause certain genes

330
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,320
to be switched on and others to be

331
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,240
switched off. Transcrytoics, the uh the

332
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
various different uh ways that you can

333
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,120
turn sequences of genes into proteins

334
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,440
that are in your body. Proteomics, the

335
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,760
20 to 25,000 proteins that are being

336
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
produced every day by your body.

337
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,720
Metabolomics, the chemical reactions

338
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,959
that make life possible. And finally,

339
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,199
most recently, microbiomics, the

340
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
colonies of bacteria that inhabit our

341
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,040
bodies that that keep us healthy. All of

342
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,600
these OMIX have given us tremendous uh

343
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,720
uh new knowledge based upon research

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
that's been going on thanks to

345
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
convergence

346
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
with the exception of one. There is one

347
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,160
OMIX that's in the bottleneck to

348
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,519
progress. And you know what that Omix

349
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,680
is? Economics. uh because you got to pay

350
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,320
for stuff and we're using the same old

351
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,120
stuff, the same old business models to

352
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,600
try to do those kinds of financings. So

353
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,720
what I want to tell you about is a

354
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,639
challenge that economics is facing and

355
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
how we can get around that challenge.

356
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,279
And the challenge is this, the valley of

357
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,639
death. When I first started getting

358
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,519
interested in healthcare, I would talk

359
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,839
to scientists and and doctors, you know,

360
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,160
in in Boston, Cambridge. We have a lot

361
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,639
of them as you know, very very uh uh

362
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,600
good ones. And I would ask them, you

363
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,120
know, why isn't there more progress? And

364
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,680
they keep telling me about the valley of

365
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,279
death, the valley of death. So I'm

366
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,680
thinking, what does Southern California

367
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,440
have to do with uh progress in the biio

368
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,279
medicine? And then they they tell me,

369
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,440
"No, no, no, it's not a place. It's

370
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:50,959
actually a metaphysical concept of the

371
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,839
period between scientific experiments at

372
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,000
university and medical centers and first

373
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,560
in human clinical trials. That period in

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,399
between those two milestones is the

375
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,720
valley of death. Meaning that it's

376
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,519
really hard to raise money to fund those

377
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,040
kinds of things. And so money is

378
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,920
something that I've spent a lot of time

379
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,920
studying. So my initial reaction was why

380
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,519
why is it the case that there is a

381
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,360
valley of death? I just assumed that if

382
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,800
there was a patient in need and there

383
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
was some technology that could help that

384
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
patient that magically money would

385
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,519
appear to fund a drug or a device and

386
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,360
everything would be hunky dory. Turns

387
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,680
out that that's not really how the world

388
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,240
works. And the more I studied the

389
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,639
problem, the more I realized that

390
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,639
actually the valley of death exists not

391
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
just in healthcare but in many fields

392
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
because of increasing risk and

393
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,519
uncertainty.

394
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,720
Now what do I mean by risk and

395
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,040
uncertainty? I think you all know what

396
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,360
risk is. Risk is the kind of un the kind

397
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,600
of randomness that we can parameterize.

398
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,320
So you know normal distribution, gamma

399
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,440
distribution, kai squared, we can figure

400
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
out the probability laws of risky

401
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,680
things.

402
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,399
But the uncertain things, those are what

403
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,839
economists refer to as the unknown

404
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,000
unknowns because nobody's ever done them

405
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,160
before. There's no data. So you can't

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,439
assess the probability that this could

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,799
possibly happen. And so that's the

408
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,120
challenge that the valley of death uh

409
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,439
ultimately needs to overcome

410
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,679
because drug development is a very

411
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,679
lengthy process. As some of you may

412
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,640
know, you have to go through clinical

413
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,960
testing. And because of that process,

414
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,120
there are three things about investing

415
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,320
in drug development that investors have

416
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,919
to get their arms around. One, it costs

417
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,400
a large amount of money to do the

418
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,200
testing. hundreds of millions to

419
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,760
billions of dollars in order to get one

420
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,960
drug approved. Second, that process is

421
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,919
generally very very unlikely to succeed.

422
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,720
Low probabilities of success.

423
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,520
And third, it turns out that developing

424
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,559
a drug could take 10 to 15 years from

425
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,760
beginning to end. So if you compare that

426
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,799
with developing an app, how many of you

427
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,880
have actually developed an app already?

428
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah. So, I imagine that it doesn't take

429
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,360
you a hundred million dollars to do that

430
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,679
and it doesn't take you 10 or 15 years

431
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,840
and it doesn't take you uh a whole team

432
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,760
of people where you're going to fail

433
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,000
with a probability of, you know,

434
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,400
whatever 95%.

435
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,679
So, that's the problem with investing in

436
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,400
this. Um, and so I'm going to give you

437
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,000
an example of why this is so challenging

438
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,600
by asking you to think about investing.

439
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,640
Um, some of you may already have

440
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,600
invested. I especially given that we're

441
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,679
at MIT. I often encounter undergraduates

442
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,640
who are actually quite uh accomplished

443
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,960
traders and and portfolio managers. But

444
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,880
um let me give you uh the example that I

445
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,440
give my first year MBA students and see

446
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,200
how you do with this. I show them four

447
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,720
different financial investments. I don't

448
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,880
tell them what they are or even over

449
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
what time period they span. I just tell

450
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,760
them this is what happens when you put a

451
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
dollar into it and you leave it there

452
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,720
for an unspecified multi-year investment

453
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,480
horizon. The green line turns a dollar

454
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,440
into $2. Not very rewarding, but not

455
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,320
particularly risky. The red line turns a

456
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,240
dollar into $5. Way more rewarding, but

457
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,559
way more volatile. Lots of ups and

458
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,799
downs. The blue line turns a dollar into

459
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:29,039
about eight dollars. The most rewarding

460
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,120
of all, but also the most volatile. and

461
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,919
the black line somewhere in the middle.

462
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,160
Not the most rewarding, but relatively

463
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,520
reasonable amount of risk. So, if you

464
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,120
could have only one of these

465
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,039
investments, you can't mix and match

466
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,280
them. If you only could have one to put

467
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,320
your life savings or or better yet to

468
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,720
invest your grandparents retirement

469
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,640
money and you had to you had to do it

470
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
for them. They asked you to help them.

471
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,760
Which would you pick? How many of you

472
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,760
would pick the green line to invest?

473
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
Wow. No takers.

474
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,919
Okay. How about the red line? How many

475
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,960
people will take the red line?

476
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,120
No takers for the red line. I want you

477
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
to remember this moment because I think

478
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
some of you may want to call your

479
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,919
brokers afterwards when I tell you what

480
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,520
the red line is. How about the blue

481
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,000
line? How many people want to do the

482
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,080
blue line? Okay, we got one or two

483
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,240
entrepreneurs in here or hedge fund

484
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,679
managers. Okay, good. And then now the

485
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,600
black line. How about the black line?

486
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,679
Yeah, by far the most popular choice in

487
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,799
my NBA class as well. And when I ask

488
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,720
them why, they say, "Well, you know,

489
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,880
it's got the the best tradeoff between

490
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,440
risk and reward." Yeah. Question.

491
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,120
>> The block is like a Ponzi scheme.

492
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,520
>> Really?

493
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
>> I don't know. Let's see. First of all,

494
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,600
let me tell you what the four assets

495
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,159
are, and we'll talk about that. The four

496
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,039
assets are the green line, treasury

497
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,480
bills, safest asset in the world. At

498
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,280
least for the next few weeks. We'll see

499
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,720
whether the budget discussions go well.

500
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,200
As long as we agree to pay back our

501
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,039
debts, yes, safe asset, but you know

502
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
what? You put your money in it in 2008,

503
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,240
you would have earned pretty much

504
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,919
nothing. And actually, you would have

505
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
earned less than nothing because of

506
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,280
inflation if you look at the real

507
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
return.

508
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,159
All right. The red line that none of you

509
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,000
picked, that is the US stock market. I

510
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,640
bet you some of some of you may already

511
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,880
have an investment in the S&P 500,

512
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,559
right? But if you didn't pick it or if

513
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,480
you did pick it in 2008,

514
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,039
congratulations. you would have done

515
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,280
just fine since then that right very

516
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,600
very good return

517
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,520
the blue line that only one of two of

518
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,679
you picked that is the single

519
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,760
pharmaceutical company Fizer one of the

520
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,480
largest pharma company in the world and

521
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,559
if you had picked Fizer in 2008 well

522
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,960
double congratulations you would have

523
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,440
spec done spectacularly well uh since

524
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,120
then lots of volatility but but really

525
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,120
quite well now the black line that is

526
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,159
the returns to a fund called the

527
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,000
Fairfield Century Fund, which most of

528
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,679
you probably never heard of, but that

529
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,039
was the feeder fund for the Bernie

530
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,880
Maidoff Ponzi scheme. So quite right,

531
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,880
you got the the uh the correct answer.

532
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,240
Um I had to stop it in 2008 because the

533
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,960
Ponzi scheme ended up blowing up then.

534
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,960
Now I show this example to students

535
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,039
because I want to explain to them

536
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,679
something very common about human nature

537
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,640
and that is that we all as investors we

538
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,880
want high yielding lowrisk assets and we

539
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
have a name in finance that describes

540
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,720
it. It's called the sharp ratio after

541
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,600
Bill Sharp, the Nobel Prize winning

542
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,919
economist from Stanford who pointed out

543
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,400
that people care about the expected

544
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,280
return of an investment above T bills

545
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
per unit of risk that they're taking.

546
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,600
They want to have the highest expected

547
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,679
return per unit risk. High sharp ratios.

548
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,919
So what's the sharp ratio of these

549
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:58,240
investments? Well, it's.33 for the S&P

550
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:01,840
uh sorry.34 uh for Fizer.33 for the S&P

551
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,200
and on paper the Ponzi scheme had a

552
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,679
sharp ratio an order of magnitude higher

553
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,400
and that's how Bernie Maidoff suckered

554
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,039
all of these poor investors to put money

555
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,520
with him. $50 billion

556
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,679
of investor money that he essentially

557
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,440
stole uh because of this common fact.

558
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,320
Now,

559
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,200
it turns out that biio medicine has had

560
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,840
a sharp ratio that's been declining over

561
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
the last several decades. Not because

562
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
the numerator is unattractive. There are

563
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,720
many biotech companies that just do

564
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,360
super well. But the problem is the

565
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,159
numerator. The numerator is growing even

566
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,919
faster. The risk

567
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:49,600
as well as the uncertainty is growing as

568
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:54,240
we become more sophisticated about the

569
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,559
science uh and uh medicine of disease.

570
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
And so we need to figure out how to

571
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,640
increase the sharp ratio. That's that's

572
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,720
the goal.

573
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
So I know this is a math class. So I

574
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,080
could not possibly do a present

575
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,080
presentation here without giving you at

576
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,240
least one equation. So, I'm going to

577
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,480
give you an equation and it's going to

578
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,600
be a very difficult math challenge about

579
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,400
how you can increase the sharp ratio.

580
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,880
Okay? It turns out there are two ways of

581
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
increasing the sharp ratio.

582
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,720
And let me tell you, for those of you

583
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,720
who aren't as mathematically gifted as I

584
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,039
am, uh you can increase the numerator

585
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,200
or you can decrease the denominator.

586
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,120
Those are the two ways. Now, of course,

587
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
in my NBA class, I have to have a

588
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,760
student who raises his hand and says,

589
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,360
"Professor Lo, there's actually a third

590
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,840
way." I said, 'Oh, really? He said,

591
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,960
'Yes, you can do both. So, yes, I agree.

592
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,760
You can do both. It turns out that we

593
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,600
are doing both. Better science, better

594
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,159
engineering, better organizational

595
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,320
structures, on and on. All of those are

596
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,640
designed to increase the numerator and

597
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,840
decrease the denominator.

598
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,159
But the one set of techniques that have

599
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,760
not been used as much in biio medicine

600
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,760
as well as in other industries that I'm

601
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:11,279
about to tell you

602
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,960
is new financing and business models.

603
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,760
And that's the interesting opportunity

604
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,520
for mathematicians. Believe it or not,

605
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,559
there are ways of constructing new

606
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,279
business models using math that could

607
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,440
actually change the riskreward tradeoffs

608
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,760
of these investments. So let me show

609
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,360
you. I'll give you an example.

610
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:35,200
Suppose I give you an opportunity to

611
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,600
invest in a new fund that I'm creating.

612
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,720
I need $200 million

613
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,400
to launch my fund and I'm going to be

614
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,799
investing in all sorts of special

615
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,320
technologies that only I have access to.

616
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,240
You don't. So, it's proprietary. It's

617
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,039
going to take me 10 years before I give

618
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,440
you any payoff whatsoever. So, don't

619
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,840
bother asking me before the decade is

620
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,360
out whether or not I'm going to give you

621
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,440
anything back. It's going to take at

622
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,840
least that long.

623
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,400
And in full disclosure, the likelihood

624
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,279
that I give you anything back is 5%.

625
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,640
95% of the time,

626
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not going to be able to produce

627
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,360
anything after 10 years. Okay. How many

628
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,279
of you would invest with me?

629
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,600
>> Depends on the return.

630
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,279
Thank you. Most of you didn't even

631
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,039
bother raising your hand, but you you

632
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,520
want to know what the return is. Fair

633
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,840
enough. That's absolutely right. For

634
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,640
most of my MBA students, they don't

635
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,320
bother asking. When they hear $200

636
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,120
million,

637
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,840
wait 10 years, 95% failure rate, no

638
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,159
thank you, not interested. But I will

639
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,720
get one or two uh MBA students who will

640
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
ask, "What's the return?" So, let me

641
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,080
tell you, these are the back of the

642
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,480
envelope calculations for what a single

643
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,400
anti-cancer drug will do in terms of

644
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,960
potential revenues and success rates. It

645
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,520
takes about $200 million to do the

646
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,159
clinical trials. It takes about 10 years

647
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,000
to do them. And in oncology, the

648
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,440
historical success rate is actually a

649
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,559
little less than 5%, 3.4%, but I'm going

650
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,640
to use 5% as round numbers.

651
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,120
If you are successful though in the case

652
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:29,679
of cancer drugs, you will get $2 billion

653
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,400
of revenues from years 11 to 20. Why 11

654
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,720
to 20? Well, because it takes 10 years

655
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,559
to develop a cancer drug. So, if you're

656
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,200
successful, then starting in year 11 is

657
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,000
when you begin to generate cash flows.

658
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,360
And why until year 20? It's because

659
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,039
that's how long a patent lasts. After

660
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,840
year 20, your patent is gone and people

661
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,200
can compete with you and your profits go

662
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,240
way down. 2 billion 2 billion 2 billion

663
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,120
from years 11 to 20. That is equivalent

664
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,120
to a single payday of $12.3 billion in

665
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,960
year 10.

666
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,760
Okay. So now let me ask you the question

667
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,799
one more time. I need $200 million up

668
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,720
front. Wait 10 years. 95% of the time

669
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,320
I'll give you nothing, maybe a warm

670
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,159
handshake and goodbye. And 5% of the

671
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,679
time I'll give you a check for 12.3

672
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,080
billion in year 10. How many of you

673
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,399
would invest in that?

674
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,080
>> Depend on how much money we have.

675
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,000
>> No,

676
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
no. I'll take any I'll take whatever

677
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,679
>> a million. I'm not going to

678
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,520
>> Whatever Whatever money you have. How

679
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,320
How many of you All right. I'm getting

680
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,640
one or two hands, but not a lot. I'm not

681
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,720
you're not all interested because for

682
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,880
most of you it is was way too risky.

683
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,679
Takes too long. Probability of success

684
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
is too low and it's just not your cup of

685
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,960
tea. And sure enough, if we calculate

686
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,640
the rate of return, this is an expected

687
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,960
rate of return over this 10-year period

688
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,640
of about 12%. With the standard

689
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,520
deviation of 423.5%

690
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,840
for a sharp ratio of like close to zero,

691
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,640
nobody's interested in this.

692
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,039
or very few people.

693
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,960
So this is where financial engineering

694
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,039
can make a difference and where math

695
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,279
comes into play. A very very small

696
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,360
amount of math.

697
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,480
Instead of investing in one of these

698
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,520
drugs, why not invest in oh I don't know

699
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,000
150 of them all at the same time.

700
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,279
If we did that, if we invested 150, you

701
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,840
might say, well wait a minute, that

702
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,760
takes 150 times 200 million which is $30

703
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,159
billion. That's not the kind of math

704
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,440
that would make anybody excited. $30

705
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,520
billion. Where are you going to get $30

706
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,880
billion?

707
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,760
And as an economist, I have a very

708
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,200
simple answer for that. The answer is

709
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,399
assume we have $30 billion.

710
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
I'll come back to this. I'll come back

711
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,080
to this in a minute. But if we had $30

712
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,159
billion and if we assume that the 150

713
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,320
projects are statistically independent

714
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,880
and identically distributed, and I'll

715
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,159
come back to that assumption later. If

716
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,919
that's the case, then

717
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,559
the expected rate of return for the

718
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,480
portfolio is the same because they're

719
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,600
identical projects,

720
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,840
but the risk now goes down by the square

721
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,480
root of the number of projects. Why?

722
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,159
Because the variance of the sum is the

723
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,120
sum of the variances when they're iid.

724
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,279
And so if the variance is the sum of the

725
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,399
individual variances, take the square

726
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,720
root of that to get the standard

727
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,520
deviation. That's why it goes down by

728
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,880
the rate of the square root of 150 which

729
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,080
gives you a 34.6%

730
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,679
risk rate. Now if I calculate the sharp

731
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,880
ratio of this, I'm getting a sharp ratio

732
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,360
that is an order of magnitude higher.

733
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,080
How many of you would invest in this

734
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,960
fund? Show of hands.

735
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,039
I'm getting a lot more hands.

736
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,039
That's where I'm going to get the money.

737
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,600
I don't have 30 billion, but you do in

738
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,559
the aggregate. If I can make this

739
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,480
investment attractive enough to get you

740
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,360
to put some of your 401k money or some

741
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,720
of your summer internship money into a

742
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:28,159
fund like this, I can raise $30 billion

743
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,240
very, very quickly. Now, the question

744
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,640
is, can you really raise $30 billion?

745
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,799
And the answer, of course, is it

746
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,720
depends. It depends on these

747
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,960
calculations that I just did. It depends

748
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,799
on the math underlying this portfolio.

749
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,760
The mathematics will tell you whether or

750
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:50,320
not this is feasible. So I'll give you

751
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,159
an example where not only does um that

752
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,640
should it work, but it actually does

753
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,880
work. And um the example has to do with

754
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,799
rare diseases. So I gave you two

755
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
examples of rare diseases at the

756
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,640
beginning. Canavan disease and liver

757
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,440
congenital amorosis. Turns out there are

758
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,640
roughly 12,000

759
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,919
different rare diseases.

760
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,000
And so individually a rare disease may

761
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,960
have a small patient population like

762
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,320
cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, luger's

763
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,200
disease or any a number of other

764
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,440
diseases. But in aggregate there are

765
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,480
more than 30 million Americans that are

766
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,440
suffering from one of these 12,000

767
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,960
diseases. I suspect that somebody in

768
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,559
this room knows a friend or a family

769
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,799
that's suffering from a rare disease.

770
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,000
Anybody just show of hands? Do you?

771
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,799
Yeah. So, it is clear that it may be

772
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,120
rare for any individual, but it is not

773
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,760
rare over a population because of just

774
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,840
the the number of mutations that are out

775
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,440
there. And so for a lot of reasons uh

776
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,000
it's actually relatively easier to

777
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,640
develop a drug for a rare disease both

778
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,880
because typically we know what's wrong.

779
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,840
There's a very serious problem and you

780
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,679
can trace the origins to one particular

781
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,279
organ and within that organ to one

782
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,840
particular mechanism and to that

783
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,600
mechanism one particular gene. So you

784
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,960
know a lot about it, but the other

785
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,039
reason it's often more uh uh successful

786
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,200
to develop these therapeutics is because

787
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,440
it doesn't cost as much money because

788
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,360
it's a rare population. So when you run

789
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,600
the clinical trials, you can run them

790
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,200
with a smaller number of people and

791
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,440
still be able to demonstrate that the

792
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,159
drug works. like the case for spark

793
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,240
therapeutics in the case of that that

794
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,880
libra's congenital amorosis I think they

795
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,080
got an FDA approval with something like

796
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,320
30 or 40 patients that's it 30 or 40

797
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,600
patients in the clinical trial and where

798
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,600
they when they were able to restore

799
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,120
their site the FDA said you don't need

800
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,840
to do any more testing we're ready to

801
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,799
prove it this is an amazing drug

802
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,720
but the key component is the fact that

803
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,039
because these rare diseases are so

804
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,440
different from each other

805
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,839
there's very little correlation in the

806
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,159
successes and failures of different

807
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,599
therapeutic programs. So when you

808
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,879
calculate the variance of the sum, it

809
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,480
really is the sum of the variances. If

810
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,399
we don't have correlation, then can

811
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,000
anybody tell me what the formula is for

812
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,639
the variance of a sum of random

813
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,280
variables?

814
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,480
>> Sum of the variance.

815
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,480
>> Exactly. How many coariances?

816
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,919
a lot of them. Exactly. Because you've

817
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,359
got A versus B, A versus C, A versus D,

818
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,960
B versus C, B, all the combinations. And

819
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,560
so it turns out that when there's

820
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
correlation, it's almost always

821
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,919
positive. And so when you calculate the

822
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,240
variance of a sum of a portfolio of

823
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,320
typical investments, you're getting not

824
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,640
just the individual variances, but all

825
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,599
the pair-wise coariances. If there

826
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,560
aren't any pair-wise covariances, that's

827
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,640
where the risk reduction comes from. And

828
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,880
so rare diseases have this really cool

829
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,960
property that I I have to admit I'm

830
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,440
quite proud. I was the one who wrote a

831
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,200
paper that recognized it. Frankly, I

832
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
didn't think it was that big a deal

833
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,960
except for this particular application.

834
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,320
But it turns out that the in the in the

835
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,160
biomedical field, nobody had ever

836
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
thought about this. the fact that

837
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,520
because the diseases are so different,

838
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,240
you ought to develop them not separately

839
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,560
but together in a single portfolio to

840
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,599
get the risk reduction. So instead of

841
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,720
$30 billion, you only need 4 to 500

842
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,079
million, instead of 150 projects, you

843
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,160
only need 10 or 20 to get

844
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,760
diversification.

845
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,599
And so what did I do with this

846
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
information?

847
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,880
I wrote a paper. That's what we do in

848
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,920
academia. published a paper, ran a Monte

849
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,079
Carlo simulation to show that if you

850
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,680
actually used relevant industry numbers,

851
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,640
the kind of rate of return you're

852
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,359
looking at is around 22% per year

853
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,200
and with a volatility that could be

854
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,640
quite a bit lower than that, meaning a

855
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,599
sharp ratio greater than one. Now, you

856
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,760
can ask Jake afterwards about whether or

857
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,920
not a sharp ratio greater than one is

858
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,560
good. As a professional investor and a

859
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,480
risk manager for Harvard management

860
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,960
company, he can attest to the fact that

861
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,520
this is a very attractive and very rare

862
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,960
kind of opportunity.

863
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,280
But there are, remember, there are

864
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,240
12,000 rare diseases. So, it doesn't

865
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,119
seem that rare to me. So, the question

866
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,280
is, does this really work?

867
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,200
And the reason I wrote the paper was

868
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,240
because I wanted people to try it out.

869
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,160
And I got a phone call shortly after the

870
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,720
paper came out from a former student of

871
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,040
mine. Somebody who was a PhD in chemical

872
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,040
engineering here at MIT, took one of my

873
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,440
finance courses when he was here, then

874
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,800
went on and became a biotech VC and

875
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,960
called me up said, "Professor Law, I

876
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,040
read your paper. Really interesting. Um,

877
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,920
would you mind rerunning your

878
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,480
simulations not with your assumptions

879
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,839
but with mine?" And I said to this

880
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
former student, of course, I'd be happy

881
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,640
to. You know a lot more about the

882
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
industry than I do. I'm just using

883
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,480
industry averages, whereas you actually

884
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,480
have hard data based upon your own

885
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,960
portfolio investments. So we ran a model

886
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,240
with his parameters instead of mine. And

887
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,079
the results, they look better. And so

888
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,839
then I suggested a few other tweaks

889
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,839
based upon what he was telling me about

890
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,720
the industry, the way it works in his

891
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,960
field. And we ran my version and it

892
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,520
looked better still.

893
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,520
over six months, I think we ran 35

894
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,119
different versions of this model.

895
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,880
And

896
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,359
at the end of that six-month period, he

897
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,040
came into my office and said, uh, I just

898
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,040
want to let you know, I quit my job

899
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,520
yesterday. I'm going to do this. I'm

900
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,720
going to build this company. And I got

901
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,560
to tell you, that scared the hell out of

902
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,240
me. I had never had that effect on any

903
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,240
of my students. And he had a young kid

904
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,839
in his household. And I said, Neil, are

905
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,960
you sure you want to do this? I need

906
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,960
maybe you should let me run a few more

907
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,400
simulations. And he said, "No, no, no.

908
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,520
My wife is cool. I think we're ready to

909
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,359
do this." I felt guilty enough that I

910
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,839
invested a small amount of in the

911
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,520
friends and family round. And in

912
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,079
retrospect, I wish I would have invested

913
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,680
a lot more because that's probably my

914
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,920
single most uh uh profitable investment.

915
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,440
In uh in 2017, this company Bridge

916
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:35,839
Bioarma came out of stealth mode. And um

917
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,000
we had our first investor was um not a

918
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,720
uh venture capitalist but a private

919
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,640
equity firm that prior to this company

920
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,560
had never invested in biotech. The

921
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,079
company is called KKR. You may have

922
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,320
heard of them. Some of you undoubtedly

923
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,760
will be doing internships with them uh

924
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,079
sometime in the next few years. Um we

925
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,920
raised about $40 million in that very

926
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,960
first round after the friends and family

927
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,640
round. Uh a year later we raised another

928
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,119
135. A year later yet another 300. So we

929
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,440
were right around the 4 to500 million

930
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,440
range. We had about 15 projects just

931
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,839
like the simulations. And at that point

932
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,000
we did an IPO and after the IPO we

933
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:19,119
raised another 750. Um and as of uh this

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,359
morning or early this morning uh before

935
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,520
the market opened uh Bridge Bio is

936
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,079
currently trading at about $4.6 billion

937
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,720
dollars of market cap. All of the

938
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,640
investors myself included have done

939
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,000
better than we ever would have expected.

940
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,839
Uh a great rate of return. But uh you

941
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,480
know what that's not what this company

942
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,560
is proud of. what they are most proud of

943
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
is the fact that there are other

944
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,119
portfolio companies that have gotten

945
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,200
started thanks to us and and uh this

946
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,200
it's now become a thing that you can use

947
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,359
portfolio theory to reduce your risk as

948
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,960
this McKenzie report in 2021 put out and

949
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,040
um at this point bridge bio has about 20

950
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,920
different projects in the clinic two

951
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,960
drugs have already been approved in 2021

952
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,119
uh a drug focusing on a very rare kind

953
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,480
of uh enzyme deficiency

954
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,160
as well as a uh a rare kind of of bile

955
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,400
duct cancer. Both of them were approved

956
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,760
in 2021. Um a uh a third blockbuster

957
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,240
drug looks like it's going to get

958
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,079
approved uh sometime later this month.

959
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,400
So watch the news for an announcement

960
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,280
from Bridge Bio.

961
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,960
And um you know that gene therapy for

962
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,720
that little girl who had cannavan

963
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,680
disease that turns out to be a bridge

964
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,480
bio drug and as of last year that drug

965
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,839
with 10 patients have shown efficacy in

966
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,640
every single one of the patients that

967
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,560
have the disease. So we expect that the

968
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,640
uh FDA will approve that drug sometime

969
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,800
next year. uh really amazing and um I

970
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,040
got to tell you the the proudest

971
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,119
professional accomplishment that I've

972
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,680
ever experienced um was this moment here

973
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,920
uh when I met that little girl. Uh she

974
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,040
actually lives in Boston uh in Jamaica

975
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,359
plane and uh here she was. the parents

976
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,000
found out about um the business model

977
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,079
that that I developed along with Neil

978
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,880
and asked to meet with me and it was

979
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,440
really kind of a a scary and extremely

980
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,800
emotional meeting. Uh this is the flower

981
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,839
bakery um right across the uh the mass

982
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,839
or the the salt and pepper bridge um

983
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,640
where uh Mass General is. That's where

984
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,480
they were going for their care. And I

985
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,240
went into this um uh flower bakery uh to

986
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,880
meet them. And um my first vision was

987
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,280
walking up the stairs uh holding her

988
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,880
father's hand and she kept pushing his

989
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,280
hand away because she wanted to do it on

990
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,480
her own. is just an extraordinary

991
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,960
extraordinary moment. Th this is the

992
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,599
power of financial engineering. And let

993
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,839
me be very clear, I had zero to do with

994
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,720
any of the scientific decisions that

995
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:02,240
Bridge Bio made. Um I often tell people

996
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,680
that, you know, finance cannot turn a

997
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,599
bad drug into a good one. But the lack

998
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,920
of financing or the wrong kind of

999
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,920
financing can easily take a good drug

1000
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,800
and destroy it and make sure it never

1001
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:19,599
reaches a patient. And so finance uh is

1002
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,359
an important aspect of drug development,

1003
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,800
but it is not the most important aspect.

1004
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,480
You got to start with the science and

1005
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,400
then figure out what the right financing

1006
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,000
is.

1007
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,319
So I'm going to turn to my second topic

1008
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,440
now, which is energy transition. I want

1009
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,760
to illustrate the fact that finance is

1010
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,960
not just about biotech, but it really

1011
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,000
can transform any industry. And I know a

1012
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,960
number of you are concerned about

1013
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,119
climate change. So am I. So is Jake and

1014
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,880
Peter. And the question is, what do we

1015
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,359
do about it? Now, there is this thing

1016
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,440
called energy transition. Um, and

1017
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,359
there's a report that I read a couple

1018
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,319
years ago that I highly recommend. It's

1019
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,440
an a rather harsh dose of reality.

1020
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,599
People talk about energy transition like

1021
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,119
we're going to get off of fossil fuels

1022
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,280
soon. And what this paper argues is

1023
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,560
that, you know, that's really not the

1024
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,960
right term. We are not

1025
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,520
taking less and less of our energy from

1026
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,160
fossil fuels. And here's a graph that

1027
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,839
illustrates it. So this is a graph of

1028
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:25,119
how much energy we are consuming as uh

1029
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,480
broken down by different sources. So

1030
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:32,160
here oil um you can see you know

1031
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:37,280
certainly uh natural gas and coal all

1032
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,960
three forms of fossil fuels are growing

1033
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,160
in the amount that we're consuming year

1034
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,760
after year. Now now how can that be?

1035
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,839
Because we are making progress with

1036
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,760
renewables, right? So here's wind and

1037
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:54,079
solar. This is in in uh in blue and here

1038
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,200
is you know nuclear here. um they're

1039
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,960
getting a little bit wider but not

1040
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:04,079
nearly as fast as the fossil fuels are.

1041
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,960
And it's because human population is

1042
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:11,040
growing. And also the the the kind of

1043
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,280
people that we have on this planet

1044
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,040
that's changing. We are now having more

1045
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
and more people that are moving into the

1046
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,040
middle class. And when you move into the

1047
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,839
middle class, what do you want? You want

1048
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,000
a better life. You want a a house. You

1049
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,240
want two cars instead of one. You want

1050
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,240
to take a vacation by flying somewhere.

1051
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,599
And all of the things that you and I

1052
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,760
take for granted, there are millions to

1053
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,200
hundreds of millions of people that are

1054
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,920
for the first time being able to

1055
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,160
experience it. And that's why the

1056
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,880
consumption of energy is growing far

1057
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,960
faster than our ability to create uh

1058
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,520
non-greenhouse gas sources of energy. So

1059
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
the problem with energy transition is

1060
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,400
that, you know, if you just look at

1061
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,440
what's going on, we we we can't just

1062
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:01,440
rely on renewable energy. We need to

1063
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,040
have lowcarbon forms of energy that

1064
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,560
don't pollute the atmosphere and that

1065
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:10,240
are on demand available. So what are we

1066
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,400
doing? How are we transitioning from one

1067
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,560
energy source to another? It's not

1068
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,760
really transitioning. We're not

1069
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,359
declining our usage of these kinds of

1070
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,040
sources of energy, but we need to be

1071
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:26,319
adding to them with lowcarbon sources.

1072
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:30,800
And so from what my experts in energy,

1073
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:33,359
my colleagues here in the geo uh um uh

1074
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,040
department are telling me, um they're

1075
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,560
telling me that there are three sources

1076
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,720
of

1077
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,560
renewable of of energy that is

1078
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,760
non-renewable. They're not wind and

1079
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,800
solar, but they are ultimately going to

1080
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,680
be infinite close to infinite sources of

1081
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,000
energy. And that is fusion, fision, and

1082
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,160
geothermal. And for a variety of

1083
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,520
reasons, we're not going to see a lot of

1084
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,599
progress in the near term for fision. We

1085
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,839
already have nuclear power plants. Uh

1086
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,280
but the problem from a political point

1087
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,599
of view is nobody wants to have them

1088
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,640
near where they live and nobody wants to

1089
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,200
deal with the mess of the fuels that

1090
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,200
ultimately uh when they degrade become

1091
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,760
radioactive and dangerous. So um because

1092
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,319
the prices of fossil fuels are highly

1093
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,800
path dependent, this energy transition

1094
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,480
is very very difficult to predict. And

1095
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,240
what that tells us is we need to start

1096
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,760
thinking about alternative sources of

1097
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,920
energy that are going to be sustainable.

1098
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,359
And so it turns out that nuclear energy

1099
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:38,160
is the main source of sustainable energy

1100
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:41,599
for the for the for the long-term future

1101
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,520
of the human uh species. And there are

1102
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,200
only two forms of nuclear energy, fusion

1103
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,079
and fision. So as you probably know,

1104
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,280
fusion is when we split an atom and you

1105
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,800
get more energy out than you put in. But

1106
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,640
fusion energy is where you squeeze atoms

1107
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,319
together. And it turns out that the

1108
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,280
squeezing gives you a lot more energy

1109
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:03,680
than the splitting of an atom. It also

1110
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,920
turns out that fusion energy is the most

1111
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,960
abundant form of energy in the entire

1112
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,920
universe. Why? Because this is what

1113
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,240
powers stars and that's where we get all

1114
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,319
of our energy other than geothermal.

1115
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,000
It's basically we're getting energy from

1116
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,880
the sun.

1117
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,240
So fusion turns out can produce roughly

1118
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,880
four times more energy uh per kilogram

1119
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,560
of fuel than fision. And here's the the

1120
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,160
kicker. It does not produce longlasting

1121
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:37,359
radioactive waste. When you uh uh are

1122
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,480
are are finished using fisionbased

1123
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,400
energy systems like uranium, plutonium,

1124
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,040
you will have radioactive waste that in

1125
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,520
some cases have a halflife of 100,000

1126
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,319
years, which is a lot longer than I plan

1127
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,160
to live. So that's the problem. Whereas

1128
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:58,240
with fusion energy, it produces

1129
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,079
water and helium and maybe some tridium,

1130
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,000
which is radioactive, but it doesn't

1131
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,319
last that long. And moreover, tridium is

1132
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,040
something that we need as part of our

1133
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:12,640
fusion um uh inputs. So the problem with

1134
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,200
fusion is you need three things to

1135
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,960
happen. The so-called loss in triple

1136
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,119
product.

1137
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,760
You need to take a compound, some

1138
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,040
matter, and you need to squeeze it

1139
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,079
together really hard because that's how

1140
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,720
you're going to get atoms to fuse.

1141
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,640
Unfortunately, just squeezing it is not

1142
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,800
enough on this planet. You have to

1143
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,400
loosen them up. Loosen them up so that

1144
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,200
they will come together. And that means

1145
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,000
you have to heat it to a very very high

1146
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,200
temperature. And then you have to hold

1147
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,240
on to it for a long enough period of

1148
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,319
time so that the fusion reactions can

1149
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,079
happen. [snorts] So these are the three

1150
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,559
things that have to happen. Temperature,

1151
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,680
pressure, and time. Now it turns out

1152
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,920
that in the on the sun or in the sun

1153
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,400
this happens relatively easily. The the

1154
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:06,720
pressure gets created by gravitational

1155
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,200
pull and the temperature increases as a

1156
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,280
function of how it pulls in through the

1157
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,280
gravity the different uh combustible

1158
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,400
items. And as we know once you ignite

1159
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,400
fusion it lasts and lasts and lasts for

1160
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,359
many many hundreds of thousands to

1161
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,200
millions of years.

1162
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:30,480
So something pretty amazing happened

1163
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,400
here in Cambridge on Labor Day weekend

1164
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,359
2021.

1165
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,480
What happened is that MIT in

1166
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:41,119
collaboration with a spin-off that it

1167
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,280
created called Commonwealth Fusion

1168
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,119
Systems.

1169
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:51,040
They created a magnetic field that was

1170
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:55,119
so strong that it will in principle be

1171
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,599
able to contain fusion reactions to the

1172
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,040
to the the degree that we need in order

1173
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:04,880
to achieve ignition. It can actually

1174
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:08,640
light this plasma. And this

1175
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:12,400
demonstration occurred about five blocks

1176
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,839
from here on Albany Street. uh they

1177
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,839
created a 20 Tesla magnet. 20 Tesla

1178
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,400
magnet that is an extremely strong

1179
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,599
magnetic field. And the interesting

1180
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,240
thing about what happened here is that

1181
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,839
three months later, this Oh, and by the

1182
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,079
way, this is yours truly. I was there

1183
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,280
for this event. Um I had collaborated

1184
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,440
with Dennis White, the head of the

1185
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,280
plasma science infusion center. Uh so he

1186
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,240
kindly invited me to be there. This was

1187
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,559
by the way Sunday morning at 7:30 a.m.

1188
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,280
Labor Day weekend. I was out on the Cape

1189
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,599
with my family and I abandoned them to

1190
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,440
come here. That's how nerdy I was. Uh

1191
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,319
but it was an extraordinary historical

1192
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:55,920
event. What happened after that of

1193
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:57,440
course was we saw that um the uh uh

1194
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,400
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory at

1195
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,640
Berkeley. They actually created a truly

1196
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,040
exothermic fusion reaction, meaning more

1197
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,760
money more power came out than money

1198
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,920
went than than energy went in. which

1199
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,240
basically says you're creating money out

1200
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,800
of nothing. If money is energy, then

1201
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,160
you're putting more money, you're you're

1202
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,440
getting more money out than you're

1203
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,359
putting in. Um, also the regulatory

1204
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,720
authorities have agreed that fusion

1205
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,520
should not be regulated the way that

1206
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,920
fision is, which is pretty big. And yet

1207
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:33,119
another repeat of fusion uh in 2023.

1208
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,480
So the question that that um my

1209
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,480
colleague in the plasma science and

1210
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,839
fusion center Dennis White and I have

1211
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,160
asked is can we use finance to fund

1212
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,359
fusion. So we wrote a paper about this

1213
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,920
too and in this paper we do a

1214
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,880
calculation that shows yes there is a

1215
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,760
path of creating a portfolio in order to

1216
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,680
fund fusion. Now a portfolio of what? So

1217
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,319
so I I have to I have to answer that

1218
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,000
question. In order for me to answer a

1219
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:03,119
question about portfolio of what I have

1220
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,319
to describe what do I mean by saying

1221
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:08,880
fusion. What do we mean by fusion?

1222
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:13,359
What I mean is to create a commercially

1223
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:18,319
viable power plant or reactor that will

1224
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:21,359
generate enough heat to create a turbine

1225
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,520
that will spin and generate electrons to

1226
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:26,400
be put on the power grid. That's what I

1227
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,000
call fusion. And so what that means is

1228
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,480
you need this. You need a fusion reactor

1229
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,200
that will do its thing and generate

1230
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,440
heat. The heat will basically heat up

1231
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,559
water. Water will turn to steam. That

1232
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,480
will basically cause turbines to spin.

1233
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,559
As the turbines spin, you generate

1234
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,280
electricity and the electricity goes on

1235
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:51,359
existing power grids. So this whole

1236
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,359
thing is what I'm calling fusion.

1237
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,599
That's what I want to do. That's what I

1238
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,640
want to invest in.

1239
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:02,400
Now, how do we do that? How do we invest

1240
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:05,119
in fusion? And the answer has to do with

1241
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,680
what it takes to achieve fusion

1242
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,559
electrons on the grid. These are all the

1243
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,160
components that experts tell me are

1244
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:18,480
needed in order to get fusion to happen.

1245
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:21,040
And so the question is,

1246
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,440
how do we do that?

1247
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,800
And the answer like anything else is

1248
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,800
break it apart. Look at it one by one

1249
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,119
and figure out what you need in order to

1250
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,599
achieve these different components. So

1251
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:37,200
one of the things we need is high uh

1252
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,920
sustained high temperature plasma. So

1253
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,440
plasma is a fourth state of matter. When

1254
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,800
you heat something up to a certain

1255
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,240
temperature, it becomes plasma. The

1256
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,160
problem is as it gets hotter, it's

1257
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,480
harder and harder to contain this uh

1258
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,480
kind of matter and so you need to have

1259
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,119
some way to hold on to it. Well,

1260
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,760
magnetic bottles are what we're

1261
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,839
considering in one form of fusion. But

1262
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,640
if that's the issue of uh creating high

1263
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:09,359
temperature plasma, then let's take it

1264
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,640
and break it apart. What do we need just

1265
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,319
to do that? And by the way, just to let

1266
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,480
you know what high temperature means,

1267
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:23,440
we're talking about 100 million degrees.

1268
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,040
100 million degrees. That's hot. So, how

1269
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,480
do we achieve that? Well, it turns out

1270
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,280
that there are a bunch of things you

1271
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,000
need in order to do it.

1272
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,079
So, what do we do? This is the portfolio

1273
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,040
I'm talking about. I'm talking about

1274
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,240
creating a portfolio of technology

1275
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:44,000
that when combined will allow you to

1276
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,400
achieve fusion, but even if never

1277
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,319
combined, they have value in and of

1278
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,400
itself. For example, advanced vacuum

1279
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,880
systems. It turns out that in order to

1280
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,480
create achieve really high temperatures,

1281
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,119
you have to have ultra pure conditions

1282
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,280
with no contaminants and no air in

1283
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,520
particular, you need to have a vacuum

1284
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,079
system that works far better than your

1285
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,680
typical Hoover vacuum cleaner. It turns

1286
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,000
out that if you can create that vacuum

1287
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,400
system, it has applications in many

1288
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,960
other things like for example in, you

1289
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,960
know, drug development. And so if you

1290
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:21,520
think about fusion not as one thing but

1291
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,000
as a portfolio of a whole bunch of

1292
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,319
different technologies that have value

1293
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,200
in and of themselves but that when

1294
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:31,680
combined will have value for fusion. you

1295
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,920
can basically break it apart and do the

1296
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,000
kind of financial analysis that we just

1297
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,640
did with a single drug development

1298
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,319
project and then put them into a

1299
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,480
portfolio maybe 150 of them and figure

1300
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:48,160
out the risk and reward and be able to

1301
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:51,440
finance it. So the idea is to create a

1302
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,160
multi-billion dollar fusion mega fund

1303
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,559
just like we did with the cancer mega

1304
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,720
fund and finance all these different

1305
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,240
technologies and you know imagine

1306
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,720
creating an incredible board of

1307
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,200
adviserss on the scientific side you've

1308
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,680
got people like you know Mike Campbell

1309
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,839
University of Rochester expert in laser

1310
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,319
technology Steve Chu former energy

1311
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,400
secretary Nobel Prize winner uh Rob

1312
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,640
Goldstone Dave Labbersteier Ernest

1313
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,280
Monise also another former energy

1314
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,359
secretary that was a MIT faculty member.

1315
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,880
Uh Dennis White, the former head of the

1316
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,359
plasma science infusion center and so

1317
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,280
on. And then on the business side,

1318
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,119
you've got people like Sam Alman, Jeff

1319
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,079
Bezos, Peter Diamandis, Bill Gates,

1320
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,720
Venode Kosla, so on and so forth. People

1321
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,280
that can actually help us manage the

1322
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,599
business models.

1323
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,040
Now you might say, well, wait a minute,

1324
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,240
you know, how are you going to get these

1325
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,559
people to be part of this effort?

1326
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,960
And that's a challenge because, you

1327
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,400
know, the folks in blue, they're not

1328
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,480
motivated by money. So, if I call them

1329
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,359
up and ask them to be part of this, I I

1330
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,960
I would doubt that they would even

1331
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:02,880
return my phone calls. They've never

1332
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:06,160
heard of me. The folks in green, uh,

1333
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,720
they have all the money. And so, I'm

1334
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,760
pretty sure that, uh, and actually I

1335
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,280
know a number of them already. So that's

1336
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,920
why I know that if I call them, they

1337
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,200
will not return my phone calls. But if

1338
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,119
you raise multi-billion dollars to

1339
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,119
deploy capital, all of them will return

1340
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,400
your phone call. Not not just because of

1341
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,160
the money. As I said, the people in

1342
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,520
blue, they don't they don't care about

1343
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,720
money. And the people in green, they

1344
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,440
have all the money. They don't need your

1345
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,680
money. But if you can actually show that

1346
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,119
there's a business path that allows you

1347
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,079
to achieve your goal of ignition,

1348
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,240
they'll all want to be part of it. And

1349
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,680
finally, how many of you, if I created a

1350
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,000
fund like this with these people, how

1351
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,119
many of you would put as a one-time

1352
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,640
investment, just one-time investment,

1353
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,680
$1,500

1354
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,920
of your 401k money that you may have

1355
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,920
saved up after a summer internship or

1356
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,040
after your first year working at your

1357
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,599
job. How many of you will put a

1358
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,440
hundred,500 into a fusion fund?

1359
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,400
That's where I'm going to get the

1360
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,799
multi-billions of dollars because with

1361
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:14,000
130 million households out there, if 3%

1362
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:17,280
of you put in $1,500, that's more than

1363
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,960
$30 billion right there. We can do this.

1364
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,119
This can actually be be done. So, there

1365
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,680
are many other examples of this. Yeah.

1366
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,119
Question. Um, wouldn't the portfolio for

1367
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,079
the fusion like all those different

1368
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,000
things, wouldn't they be highly

1369
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,319
correlated by these different industries

1370
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
as opposed to drugs that wouldn't be?

1371
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,319
>> Well, that's a great question. Let's go

1372
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,440
back and take a look at it. So, it's

1373
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:42,720
true that the entire fusion reactors of

1374
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,040
many different companies will be

1375
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,480
correlated, but they will not be

1376
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,839
perfectly correlated if they're using

1377
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,440
different ways of achieving fusion.

1378
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,599
Right? One uses magnetic, the other one

1379
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,880
uses inertial. And so there are

1380
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,839
different technologies but more

1381
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,240
importantly if I look at this portfolio

1382
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,680
of technologies. So one of them is

1383
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,839
plasma heating systems. How to make

1384
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,520
things really hot. The second one is

1385
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,599
advanced vacuum systems. How to keep

1386
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,839
things really clean and pure. A third

1387
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,839
one is magnetic confinement

1388
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:12,079
technologies. So how you shape the

1389
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:14,240
magnets in order to keep the bottle from

1390
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,720
uh becoming unstable.

1391
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,440
Each of those things have nothing to do

1392
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,280
with each other.

1393
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,280
>> Oh right. Okay. I thought I thought they

1394
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,799
might. That's all. That makes sense.

1395
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,040
>> Yeah. The technology, the component,

1396
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,839
some of them do, but most of them do

1397
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,960
not.

1398
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:30,720
>> And that's where you're going to get the

1399
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:34,079
diversification. You're right.

1400
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,400
>> So, um, lots of other technologies. The

1401
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,720
key to all of these are that they are

1402
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,119
long shots. Very, very low probability

1403
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,200
or unknown probability of success. They

1404
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,920
cost a lot of money. They take a lot of

1405
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,280
time, but the returns to society are

1406
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,119
huge. And so that's why you need to have

1407
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,000
innovative financing for these long

1408
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,079
shots. The key to all of this is to have

1409
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,240
the right narrative,

1410
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,839
the right story to tell investors about

1411
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,079
how you're going to give them a return

1412
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:04,319
on their investment. And that requires

1413
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:07,359
the right business models to be able to

1414
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,839
do that. So, I'm going to wrap up with a

1415
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,440
story that I use lots of times because

1416
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:14,799
when I first heard it, I was so

1417
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,799
impressed that I decided that that was

1418
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:19,440
going to be my motivation for doing what

1419
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:21,680
I'm doing. Um, it has to do with this

1420
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,839
man, Professor Harvey Lotus. He's a

1421
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,079
biology faculty member here at MIT in

1422
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:28,400
the Whitehead Institute.

1423
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,920
Harvey when he uh was an assistant

1424
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:34,319
professor in 1983 was approached by uh a

1425
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:37,359
businessman asking whether he would

1426
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,119
collaborate with him to create a um a

1427
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,599
treatment for a rare disease called

1428
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,000
gocha's syndrome. This is also one of

1429
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,280
these genetic typos which prevents your

1430
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,040
body from producing important

1431
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,760
housekeeping enzymes. And without this

1432
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,119
enzyme, fatty acids build up in your

1433
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,720
your um spleen, your bone marrow, and by

1434
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,880
the time you're a teenager, if you have

1435
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,799
a very serious version of this disease,

1436
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,720
you're dead.

1437
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,040
And so Harvey and his colleagues, they

1438
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,359
developed a treatment to deal with this

1439
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,079
disease by replacing the enzyme with an

1440
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:13,280
artificially developed version of it.

1441
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:16,000
And um this little company in 1991 got a

1442
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:19,040
drug called Seriday uh approved by the

1443
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,359
FDA, the first ever enzyme replacement

1444
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,319
therapy. They would just put back into

1445
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:26,640
these uh individuals bodies the missing

1446
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,839
enzyme that uh you know they they their

1447
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,200
bodies don't produce. They could produce

1448
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:32,720
it outside and give it to them. And um

1449
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,799
you may have heard of Harvey's little

1450
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:40,559
company uh it's called Genzyme. And in

1451
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:45,400
2012, 2014, Genzyme was purchased by

1452
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,400
Seni for $20 billion.

1453
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,040
Now, that's not why I want to be Harvey

1454
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,799
Lowish. Although that's not a bad

1455
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,119
reason, by the way. I'm an economist

1456
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,599
after all. Uh, see, I want to be Harvey

1457
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,079
because of what happened in 2002.

1458
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,079
In that year, Harvey's daughter was

1459
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,799
pregnant with her second child. Harvey

1460
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:04,960
and his wife's second grandchild, a boy,

1461
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:06,559
uh, named Andrew. Great name, by the

1462
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,400
way.

1463
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:13,400
Andrew was diagnosed in utero with gocha

1464
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,400
syndrome.

1465
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,480
What are the chances of that?

1466
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,240
So I I talked to Harvey about this. I I

1467
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,599
asked him, you know, it was very

1468
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,559
emotional conversation. I asked him,

1469
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:27,280
Harvey, did you know in 1983

1470
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,880
when you started Genzyme that you would

1471
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,760
be developing a drug that would someday

1472
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,680
save the life of your as yet unborn

1473
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,160
grandson?

1474
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,599
And um and Harvey said no. He had no

1475
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,960
idea. He said, "I I thought that, you

1476
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,799
know, if I could do some cool science

1477
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,720
and and help some patients, that would

1478
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:49,680
be great." 1983 was two decades before

1479
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,440
the human genome was sequenced. So, you

1480
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:56,079
know, I had no idea that I was carrying

1481
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:58,240
the mutation. And in 2012, when his son

1482
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,280
uh turned 10, he developed the

1483
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:04,160
full-blown symptoms of goches. So he

1484
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,599
would be dead if it weren't for the drug

1485
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,240
that grandpa developed. That that's why

1486
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:13,040
I want to be Harvey Lotish. I I don't

1487
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,119
have an MD or PhD in molecular biology.

1488
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,799
I will never be able to develop a drug

1489
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,720
that will save my as yet unborn

1490
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:20,319
grandchildren.

1491
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,079
But I realized something. I realized

1492
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,760
that you know what? We can all be Harvey

1493
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,720
Lotish if we invest in the drugs that

1494
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,640
save our as yet unborn grandchildren.

1495
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,799
Finance doesn't always have to be a

1496
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,280
zero- sum game if we don't let it. With

1497
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:38,000
the right business models, the right

1498
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,839
scale at the right time, we can do the

1499
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,240
thing that everybody says they want to

1500
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:44,480
do, but very few of us ever get to do,

1501
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,039
which is that we can actually do well by

1502
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,828
doing good. And with your help, um, you

1503
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,039
know, we can do this.

1504
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,960
[music]

1505
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,960
>> Thank you. I teach MBA students, so I

1506
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,920
have to use sound effects. I'm sorry.

1507
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,319
Thank [applause] you.

1508
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,200
We have some time for questions. Sure.

1509
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,920
>> Yeah. Questions or comments?

1510
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,079
>> Yeah.

1511
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,240
>> Yeah.

1512
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:12,079
I know you mentioned about the like when

1513
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,839
you're talking about the farming part

1514
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,160
from like years 11 to 20.

1515
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,640
>> Yeah.

1516
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,319
>> And you're saying that after

1517
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,240
how long the last

1518
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:23,280
>> That's right. I was wondering after that

1519
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:26,880
you said that other people could compete

1520
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,319
um after that like I guess like I I was

1521
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,000
too sure about how the whole process

1522
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:34,400
works like after like how competition

1523
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,160
affect the

1524
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,200
um you

1525
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,960
>> sure so when you have a patent it gives

1526
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:45,599
you the right to use the information in

1527
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,119
the patent exclusively meaning nobody

1528
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:51,039
else is allowed to use that information.

1529
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,119
And so typically for drugs, what is that

1530
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:56,000
information? It's basically a chemical

1531
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,000
formula for a particular compound that

1532
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,319
doesn't exist in nature naturally. You

1533
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,720
created it, you came up with it, you

1534
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,400
filed a patent disclosure, and the

1535
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,559
patent office said, "Yep, this is new

1536
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,440
and useful. Uh, we're going to grant you

1537
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,400
the patent." So for 20 years, only you

1538
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,640
are allowed to use that idea. And so

1539
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,480
when you use that idea to create a drug,

1540
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,559
you're the only one that's allowed to

1541
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,480
make the drug. And so if people want

1542
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,319
that drug, they got to pay you. And so

1543
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,319
you end up charging a price for the drug

1544
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,920
that will generate a lot of value for

1545
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:28,000
you.

1546
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,960
At the end of the 20 years, what's the

1547
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,319
deal? The deal is

1548
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,720
everybody gets to use that idea. And so

1549
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,480
now you got companies that can produce

1550
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,559
the drug because typically the producing

1551
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,319
of the drug is pretty cheap, right? Once

1552
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,680
you give me the formula, I can

1553
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:45,680
basically, you know, get a chemical

1554
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,280
manufacturing plant to come up with it

1555
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,520
relatively cheaply. you know, a few

1556
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,160
pennies a pill.

1557
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,880
The the expensive part was developing

1558
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,960
the clinical trials to get the FDA to

1559
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,480
give you the license to do it. Once

1560
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:03,599
that's done, it's all profits for you

1561
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:07,119
until such time as now everybody gets to

1562
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:10,319
produce it for relatively low amounts of

1563
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:13,680
money. So, it's like aspirin. At one

1564
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:15,920
point, aspirin was patented. Now,

1565
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,680
anybody can make it because you could

1566
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,520
look up the patent. There's the formula

1567
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,760
right there. You can do it yourself if

1568
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,440
you know how to mix those chemicals and

1569
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,160
you don't have to pay anybody for it.

1570
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,680
But before the patent expires, you're

1571
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,880
not allowed to use the idea. Or if you

1572
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,839
want to use the idea, you have to pay

1573
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:35,599
the owner of the patent a fee for using

1574
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:36,240
their idea. That's that's how it works.

1575
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,000
>> Yeah.

1576
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,720
>> How do you find these investment

1577
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,079
opportunities or how do you even begin

1578
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,079
to research these

1579
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,280
Yeah, that that's a great great

1580
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,960
question. The answer is you need to have

1581
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,400
expertise.

1582
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,720
So I mentioned as I mentioned Neil Kumar

1583
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,920
the co-founder of Bridge Bio and the

1584
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:02,400
person who who created it really um Neil

1585
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,559
has a PhD in chemical engineering but he

1586
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,799
didn't go off and become a chemical

1587
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,760
engineer. He went off and first worked

1588
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:12,559
at McKenzie advising biotech companies

1589
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,599
about their corporate strategy and

1590
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,680
ultimately he decided to start investing

1591
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,280
in various different ideas because he

1592
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,359
had the expertise. As a chemical

1593
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,280
engineer, you have the science

1594
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:25,200
background, the engineering background

1595
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,799
and then as you work in the industry,

1596
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,799
you learn about how the industry works.

1597
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,640
So you learn that aspect of it. That's

1598
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,480
what gives you the expertise. And then

1599
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,440
once you have the expertise, the

1600
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,280
companies that have the money to invest,

1601
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,119
the venture capital firms, the private

1602
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,680
equity firms, even the big pharma

1603
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:44,960
companies that have corporate venture uh

1604
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:47,359
divisions, they will want to hire you to

1605
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,760
help them manage the money. That that's

1606
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,440
how you ultimately end up being able to

1607
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,400
do that. You got to have the expertise.

1608
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,280
And by the way, that's one of the

1609
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,440
reasons why MIT graduates are so popular

1610
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,319
among Wall Street investment houses

1611
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,520
because you all not only have expertise,

1612
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:06,160
but you have the ability to learn and

1613
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:09,760
develop new expertise as needed. That

1614
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,559
that's really important.

1615
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,920
>> Yes.

1616
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,480
>> How do we invest?

1617
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,760
>> What's that?

1618
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,760
>> How do we invest in this

1619
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,960
>> in How do you invest? Well, you know,

1620
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,279
that's actually the same question I

1621
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,239
have. How do I invest in you?

1622
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,000
You all are the next generation of

1623
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:25,920
investment opportunities. And you know,

1624
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,480
I'm not saying this just to flatter you.

1625
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,480
This is a biological fact. You are going

1626
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:33,359
to be around a lot longer than Jake,

1627
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:36,159
Peter, and I. And therefore, all of you

1628
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,080
are the future of innovation. And so,

1629
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:40,000
yes, I I would love to figure out how to

1630
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,400
invest in terms of investing in these

1631
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,839
kind of companies. The the biotech

1632
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,520
companies or bridge bio is publicly

1633
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,040
traded, so anybody can invest. And I'm

1634
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,679
not suggesting you should invest in

1635
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,000
them. uh there's risk very very high

1636
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,159
risk by the way in biotech companies. So

1637
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,880
you need to be very careful about that.

1638
01:08:54,159 --> 01:09:00,400
Uh but the much harder areas to invest

1639
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,000
are the private companies because by

1640
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,000
definition they're private so you don't

1641
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,759
know as much about them as publicly

1642
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,480
traded companies where you've got you

1643
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:11,199
know a lot of published information

1644
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:15,199
and you probably are already aware but

1645
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:18,239
if you're not you you should be that MIT

1646
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:20,880
is an incredibly attractive place for

1647
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:23,600
private investors to come and look for

1648
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,000
opportunities among the students and the

1649
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,080
faculty. Y you are in a wonderful

1650
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,960
position particularly those of you who

1651
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,040
are majoring in math because your skills

1652
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,960
are portable to virtually every industry

1653
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,839
out there. I don't know of an industry

1654
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,920
that doesn't need math. Maybe the

1655
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:41,440
Hollywood film industry but you got to

1656
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,120
count your money. You know somehow Tom

1657
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,759
Cruz has to count his money. So you got

1658
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,080
to have math for that. So um I think

1659
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,839
that there are lots of of venture

1660
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,719
capitalists hanging around Kendall

1661
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:55,360
Square and MIT to try to understand

1662
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,040
whether they can invest in you. Uh you

1663
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,360
will find that to be a very very

1664
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,440
interesting phenomenon. Uh yeah I'll

1665
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,360
come back to you but uh you are first.

1666
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,520
>> So niche thing that like you want to

1667
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,280
invest in. Do these groups already exist

1668
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,880
that are like trying to do this these

1669
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,159
things but they need money or is that

1670
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,199
like the investment going towards

1671
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:16,080
starting XYZ that does this specific

1672
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:18,480
thing? Well, there is still a valley of

1673
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,600
death in the sense that there are lots

1674
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,520
of groups that want money to do the kind

1675
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,000
of cool things that you are all going to

1676
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,159
come up with on your own. By the way, to

1677
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,880
put in a plug for Dennis White, he

1678
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,480
teaches a course on fusion on nuclear

1679
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,400
engineering where as part of the course

1680
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,000
they come up with ideas, a number of

1681
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,880
which ultimately end up becoming

1682
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,600
commercialized and real startups. So

1683
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,199
there are a number of companies that

1684
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,400
can't get funded because of the valley

1685
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,880
of death. Um MIT has a much better

1686
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,280
opportunity set than if you were say at

1687
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,199
um uh Duke University or University of

1688
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,400
North Carolina. Uh that's part of the

1689
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,000
research triangle uh down south and

1690
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,840
they've got some really cool ideas,

1691
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,360
smart students and faculty as well, but

1692
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,120
because they're not part of the Boston

1693
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,640
Cambridge ecosystem, they don't have as

1694
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,159
many venture capitalists down there

1695
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,120
looking to fund various different

1696
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:12,480
projects. So, I would say that there are

1697
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,239
still lots and lots of of smaller groups

1698
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,159
that are looking for funding that can't

1699
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,400
get it because they just don't know

1700
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,560
enough about the financing. So, what

1701
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,360
I've described to you now in just this

1702
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,320
one class is probably more information

1703
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,159
than most startup uh groups have in

1704
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:31,040
terms of thinking about riskrewards and

1705
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,600
and trade-offs like that.

1706
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,760
>> Yes.

1707
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,840
>> Yeah. Say that you're also a professor

1708
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,360
here. So I'm wondering if like your

1709
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,480
classes

1710
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,480
and teachers more like healthare stuff

1711
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,560
like that here at MIT or is that

1712
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,120
something you have to learn outside?

1713
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,880
>> So again very glad you asked that

1714
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,960
question because I happen to be teaching

1715
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,920
a class right now on healthcare

1716
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:57,199
financing. It's called 15482.

1717
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,480
Now for those of you who may not um be

1718
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,480
able to take that class because of

1719
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,560
conflicts or whatever that class is

1720
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,159
actually online. It's part of MIT's open

1721
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,120
learning library. So there is a version

1722
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:09,360
of 482X that you can all sign up for.

1723
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,440
It's free. Uh there's um you know an

1724
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,199
archive version of it. So just check on

1725
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,080
the open learning library website. It's

1726
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:17,280
not part of OCW uh but uh open learning

1727
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,080
library.

1728
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,520
>> Yeah.

1729
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:23,520
>> Um so the gentleman who started bio can

1730
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,840
you just give like a rough outline of

1731
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,960
like how on earth he did that from a PhD

1732
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,600
to start.

1733
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,360
>> Sure. So the first thing he did when he

1734
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,520
graduated was he went to McKenzie a

1735
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,880
consulting company and he knew a lot of

1736
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,960
science and engineering but he didn't

1737
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,080
know much about the industry. As part of

1738
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:45,679
McKenzie's program they train they train

1739
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:48,480
their uh hires to um learn about the

1740
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:50,560
industry. So, you know, probably for the

1741
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,840
first year, he shadowed a more

1742
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,440
experienced biioarma consultant that

1743
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,920
brought him into various different

1744
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,520
companies and showed him projects that

1745
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,159
they were working on and how he could

1746
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,560
add to those projects by doing research.

1747
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:06,239
Just like if he were a chemical engineer

1748
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,719
doing research on, you know, better ways

1749
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,400
of refining oil, uh he'd have to go and

1750
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,320
read articles and then talk to people

1751
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,920
and then do experiments. In that same

1752
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,320
way, if you're in a consulting firm like

1753
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,080
McKenzie and you're working on a project

1754
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,920
like, you know, how should how should

1755
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:24,159
Fiser fund their u uh vaccine program

1756
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,760
for RSV? Well, what would he do? He

1757
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,960
would go and learn about RSV. He would

1758
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,280
read the journal articles. He would

1759
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,640
figure out how it's being funded now. He

1760
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,920
would come up with new ideas. He would

1761
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,400
try to test them out by writing

1762
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,000
different simulation uh examples to

1763
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,360
illustrate what could happen. Those are

1764
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,239
the kind of things that he did for the

1765
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,679
first 3 to 5 years of his career.

1766
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:44,960
At some point he learned enough about

1767
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:47,440
the industry to start making investment

1768
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,120
decisions like this company has got a

1769
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,719
good bet because all the things that I

1770
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,560
was studying about proper ways of

1771
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,719
funding particular projects they're

1772
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,000
doing it versus this company I don't

1773
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,440
really want to invest because they don't

1774
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,719
even understand how to fund their

1775
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:02,800
internal pipeline. So at some point he

1776
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,440
left McKenzie to join Third Rock

1777
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,760
Ventures which is um a venture capital a

1778
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,280
biotech venture capital company and then

1779
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,120
he spent a few years there learning how

1780
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,199
to make investments.

1781
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,440
It was at Third Rock that he approached

1782
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,640
me and said look I've been thinking

1783
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,840
about rare diseases as well. I've seen

1784
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:24,719
investments that Third Rock has passed

1785
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,520
on because it's not a so-called platform

1786
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,840
technology. it's only a a one-trick

1787
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,480
pony, you know, one idea, one drug, one

1788
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,760
disease, and and Third Rock thought it

1789
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:38,560
was too risky. Would you be willing to

1790
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:42,000
uh run some models with me to fund those

1791
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,000
projects? And after we ran a bunch of

1792
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,840
simulations, it gave him enough

1793
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,920
conviction that this was going to be a

1794
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,800
profitable venture that he was willing

1795
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,400
to take the risk to try to do that. And

1796
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,800
the first thing we did was we asked

1797
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,040
Third Rock, "You guys passed on these

1798
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,280
three opportunities, do you mind if we

1799
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,159
take them? Can we invest in them?" Third

1800
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:04,880
Rock said, "Be my guest. Go for it." And

1801
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:06,640
what was not appropriate for Third Rock,

1802
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,800
given they've got lots of other

1803
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,760
opportunities that they're focusing on,

1804
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,480
was a great um opportunity set for

1805
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,480
Bridge Bio, this portfolio company. So

1806
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,239
like anything else, it's a gradual

1807
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,880
process where you learn more and more

1808
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,880
and more and sometimes at some point you

1809
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
learn so much that you are confident

1810
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,080
that you know enough to be able to start

1811
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,040
your own company.

1812
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,120
>> That's very sure by the way it doesn't

1813
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,040
mean it's any less scary. There is still

1814
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,560
a scary moment where you know you you

1815
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,719
learned all this stuff but still

1816
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,440
quitting your job you know with a baby

1817
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:42,320
at home and you know bills to pay that

1818
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,679
that is scary but you know at some point

1819
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:47,760
your confidence and your ability to um

1820
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,560
you know get through that scary period

1821
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:54,080
outweighs the u the wall that uh your

1822
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:57,040
emotions put up.

1823
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,679
>> Yes. I don't know what's like uh in

1824
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,920
times of like crisis or when you

1825
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:05,040
actually like need some type of drug or

1826
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,920
like for example like um co needed like

1827
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:11,280
the vacing

1828
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,120
like too many people like I guess cuz

1829
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,440
you talked about like the death and all

1830
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,400
that stuff is that during those times

1831
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,800
like like how is it adjusted I would say

1832
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,560
or if you can

1833
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:28,080
like that compared during those times

1834
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:31,440
Well, so that's a a really important

1835
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:34,480
observation uh because in the case of CO

1836
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,920
19, we did have a valley of death and we

1837
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,600
still do have a valley of death when it

1838
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,920
comes to vaccines because the

1839
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,719
profitability of the typical vaccine is

1840
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,280
not very attractive. And so prior to

1841
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,560
COVID, most big pharma companies were

1842
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,480
actually getting out of the vaccine

1843
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,520
business. Cancer was much more

1844
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:54,159
profitable. rare diseases actually ended

1845
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:57,679
up being more profitable than vaccines.

1846
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:59,760
And so right before the pandemic hit,

1847
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,000
there were only four big pharma

1848
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,560
companies left that were still in the

1849
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,960
vaccine making business.

1850
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,199
And but once the vac once the pandemic

1851
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,159
hit and we knew that it was going to be

1852
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:15,120
bad when it came on US shores in March

1853
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,960
of 2020, we knew it was going to be bad.

1854
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,199
At that point, a lot of things started

1855
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,840
to happen all at the same time. First of

1856
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:24,239
all, philanthropy had been funding

1857
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,000
scientific experiments for vaccines for

1858
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,960
decades. In particular, the Gates

1859
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Foundation. They for years have been

1860
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,360
working on a vaccine for malaria. Still

1861
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,719
doesn't exist. By the way, we still

1862
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,719
don't have a vaccine for malaria.

1863
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,640
Believe it or not, malaria is probably

1864
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,880
the single biggest killer around the

1865
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,760
world. Not here in the US, but in

1866
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,520
Africa, where malaria is a real problem

1867
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,760
for many, many countries, and it kills

1868
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,360
literally millions of people every year.

1869
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,040
So the Gates Foundation had been working

1870
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,760
on that for many years, funding

1871
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,520
scientific research and it and funding

1872
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,480
MADNA in particular among other

1873
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:02,239
companies. And so once the vaccine hit

1874
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:04,159
US soil, we were very very quick to be

1875
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:06,159
able to collaborate with international

1876
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:08,400
scientists to get the the the sequence

1877
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:09,840
the genetic sequence of the particular

1878
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,280
spike protein that we were going to

1879
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,360
target with the various different

1880
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:17,840
antibodies. So that process worked like

1881
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:20,080
magic. We we had there was no valley of

1882
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,159
death uh for that period of time because

1883
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,600
the government stepped in and said we

1884
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:26,159
got to do something otherwise lots of

1885
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,080
people are going to die. For the very

1886
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:33,600
first time in the history of the

1887
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:39,120
industry, it took 63 days from the time

1888
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:42,400
we sequenced the co 19 vacu

1889
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:45,520
virus to when the first human patient

1890
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:49,040
was injected with the vaccine candidate.

1891
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:52,320
63 days. Typically, it takes 3 to five

1892
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:55,920
years to create a vaccine.

1893
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:57,280
It took us 63 days. That's an example of

1894
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,920
what you're talking about getting around

1895
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:03,520
the valley of death. The problem is now

1896
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,280
that COVID seems like it's over. Of

1897
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,199
course, it's not really over. You can

1898
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,199
still get CO 19 as many of you will find

1899
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,800
out in the next few months. Uh but it's

1900
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,719
not as serious. We know how to deal with

1901
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:15,040
it. We've got a number of drugs and

1902
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,080
treatments and we recognize the various

1903
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,320
different symptoms. So, because it is

1904
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,920
not that serious,

1905
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,520
people are more relaxed about it. And

1906
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,120
what that means is the valley of death

1907
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,480
is back. People don't want to spend

1908
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:30,239
money on it. They'd rather spend money

1909
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:32,880
on guess what AI, right? Let's put money

1910
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:35,920
in open AI or Anthropic or uh you know

1911
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,080
any one of these other companies. And um

1912
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,360
that that that's that's a problem. So I

1913
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,560
think that we need to worry about that.

1914
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,560
That's one of the reasons why I'm here

1915
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,280
today. Uh try to get some of you to be

1916
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,239
excited about taking your ideas and your

1917
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,640
toolkits and doing well by doing good.

1918
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:52,400
you will really do spectacularly well

1919
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,600
from a financial point of view if you're

1920
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:58,320
able to succeed in fusion or in in drug

1921
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,000
development devices and so on. But but

1922
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,520
even more importantly, you're going to

1923
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,960
feel really good about what you're doing

1924
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,320
and you're going to actually help a lot

1925
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,440
of people.

1926
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,410
>> All right, I'm out of time. So, thank

1927
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,430
you very much and uh have a good day.

1928
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,430
[applause]
