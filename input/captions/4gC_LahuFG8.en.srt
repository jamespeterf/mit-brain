1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,080
welcome everyone good morning we're so

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,440
pleased that uh you're joining us here

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,240
today for our MIT um Health Science

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,080
Forum um on the topic of speed and

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,240
foresight and Drug Discovery

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,240
accelerating and drisking innovation in

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,520
healthc care and I think um you're going

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,920
to hear about a lot of exciting

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,039
Technologies today but also not just the

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,599
the what but the how and the who how we

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,960
can work together there's um In This

12
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:32,880
Crowd uh representatives from uh MIT of

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,000
of course but also corporations from um

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
around the world leading in in the

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,600
pharmaceutical areas and neighboring

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,079
Industries so I think a really wonderful

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,000
combination of um people and uh to

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,840
network with as well as startups and

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,280
students and um those from the broad and

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,359
other of our neighboring institutes um

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,920
so welcome um i' i' just like to say a

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,199
few remarks before handing it off to um

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,519
our first speaker um firstly this is a

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
intimate event

25
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,560
um you can see we're we've got a full

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,720
house but I'd really encourage you to

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,159
participate ask questions um we're going

28
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,159
to have a panel where there's going to

29
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,799
be time for discussion and we'd like to

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,000
hear from you so um please don't be shy

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,400
and um I I thought I'd set a little of

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
the context um so by sharing some of the

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,400
remarks from some of our leaders in this

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,240
um this area that we call Kindle square

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,520
and the Greater Boston Healthcare

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,840
ecosystem so um MIT president Sally

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,840
cornbluth made the comment that her

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,920
mission was to make sure Kendall Square

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,600
becomes an infinitely self-renewing

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,360
source of biomedical process progress a

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,439
limitless creative pool perpetually

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,040
refreshed by a stream of new ideas from

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,840
every corner of life science and

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,000
engineering to unlock solutions to the

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,320
most important problems of our time so

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,320
this is a big challenge to be

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,960
limitlessly creative perpetually

48
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,079
refreshed um but we're all of us seeing

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,840
that there's a great deal of

50
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,960
transformation um throughout drug

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,479
development whether it's in Target

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,560
identification screening preclinical

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,840
clinical trials and these are due to

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
developments in high 3ut screening in

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,040
Automation and Advanced Imaging in

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,959
Cutting Edge new approaches for using

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,000
artificial intelligence and M machine

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,959
learning and model organized

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Technologies among others these are the

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,120
ones we will focus on for our um our

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,920
event today um and the our focus is on

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,000
how these tools can be employed to

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,280
accelerate and improve drisk the drug

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
development process but alongside of

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,480
this we want to talk about this

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,560
important topic of how so um recently

67
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,640
you may be aware the The reun Institute

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,280
opened a new facility and there were

69
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,239
some remarks um by Mass General um CEO

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,360
Ann kaansky that I'd like to share

71
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,480
exactly on this topic so um they're just

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,599
I think so so well phrased so she said

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,959
cross-disciplinary collaboration is a

74
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,239
Hallmark it's it's really how you do

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,200
transformational research and

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,000
breakthrough science at scale everyone

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,599
talks about this but few actually

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,519
achieve it Partnerships between

79
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,879
Healthcare and Academia accelerate these

80
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,799
breakthroughs and Foster Innovation that

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
is the model of scientific discovery

82
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,360
this whole area represents that Boston

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
and Massachusetts represent so we'll be

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
addressing this important topic also

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,519
today alongside all of these uh exciting

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,519
Technologies
