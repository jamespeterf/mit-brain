1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,040
fairly broad title but I'm actually

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,360
going to work through several case

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,840
studies to try to uh give you a flavor

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,040
of the um the ideas that I would like to

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,800
convey so I don't need to introduce

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,119
distributed Cooperative Network control

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,160
I think most of the audience is familiar

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:27,039
with the variety of applications uh I

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,840
want to talk about uh underlying sort of

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,480
fundamental limitations in control

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,160
design so I'm going to have uh two

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,840
themes uh throughout the talk uh and the

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,480
First theme is going to be that uh I'm

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,120
going to think about spatially

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,039
distributed systems uh which involve uh

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,920
networked uh and Cooperative systems

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
over networks and I'm going to talk

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,600
about distributed parameter systems

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,280
which people normally think of as

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,480
control of pdes in the same breath and

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,120
the way I want to connect them is that I

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,039
want to think about these this problem

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,400
over Continuum space and problems over

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,200
graphs and networks as I think about the

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,439
graph as dist discretized space but

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,799
discretize in in terms of the graph

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,720
structure which can be fairly

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,079
complex um we're familiar with this sort

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,240
of maybe in uh when you do pdes and you

30
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,880
do numerical methods you get typically

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,040
differential equations over typically

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,360
regular graphs but if your meshes are

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,479
not regular then you get more General

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,880
graphs and when you have discrete

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,840
systems or sort of particle methods with

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,520
a large number of particles you often

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,479
look at the equivalent pdes that come

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,320
from Continuum models so this is not an

39
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,479
unusual point of view but I want to

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,399
adopt that for control design as well um

41
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,000
because space over arbitrary graphs can

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,560
actually be quite different from say

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,280
going between discrete time and

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,240
continuous time and time is a

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,280
one-dimensional ordered set while

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,360
discretized space can have a much richer

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,560
structure we'll see that there's much

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,560
richer phenomenology or differences

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,800
between the discrete and the Continuum

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,480
so that will be one theme the other

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,160
theme is going to be uh about

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,879
constrained uh control design over

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,120
networks uh where the constraints are

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,560
coming from the a priori uh restrictions

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,920
placed on the controller architecture

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,319
and those are really the important

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,160
questions I want to address

58
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,160
um so it is generally a very difficult

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,120
problem to do optimal con constraint

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,760
control design think about decentralized

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,840
control or various other uh restrictions

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,360
the problems are typically non-convex

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,440
non-scalable Etc um on the other hand if

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,560
you think about multi-agent systems uh

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,680
there are many effective algorithms

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,239
proposed for multi-agent systems that

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,720
are not necessarily optimal but they're

68
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,920
provably correct or have certain levels

69
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,799
of of performance by Design uh so why

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,799
worry about optimality at all since it's

71
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,760
so difficult and I want to argue is that

72
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,560
optimality really is kind of a way to

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,200
think about co-design of the plant and

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,000
the controller together it's about

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
understanding how controllable the plant

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,200
is rather than trying to just design an

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,519
optimal controller and I hope to make

78
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,519
that point uh with the following example

79
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,239
that may be uh familiar to some of you

80
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,840
so uh this is an unstable airplane and

81
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,040
this was made famous in the CDC body

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,280
lecture by Gunter Stein I want to talk

83
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,879
about another problem very briefly to

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,519
make the point out I want to make

85
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:50,200
throughout the talk so think about a

86
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,159
rear steering bike so that is a a bike

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,560
where the steering uh wheel is actually

88
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,120
in the rear and you're not trying to be

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,760
fooled so when you turn the handlebar

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,079
right eventually the bike will go right

91
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,360
and vice versa okay this is a

92
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,040
fundamentally difficult bike to control

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,200
in other words it's fundamentally

94
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,040
difficult to ride um and there's a very

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,799
nice paper that I recommend to all of

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,000
you uh by Carl asan company that

97
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,000
explains all the details I'm going to

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,160
just talk about one aspect of this very

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,040
quickly um so you can understand how

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,960
difficult this bike is to ride if you

101
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,240
look at the linearized Dynamics between

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,960
uh the actuation is The Handlebar angle

103
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,080
and the output is the Tilt angle of the

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,000
bike uh and so that these are the only

105
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,120
inputs and outputs uh considered here

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
and you can think about the fundamental

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,960
limitation on the sensitivity function

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,440
over all

109
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,880
controllers uh you can find a lower

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,680
bound on this in terms of a right half

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,160
plane and pole and a right half plane

112
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,440
zero that these Dynamics have okay so

113
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,199
this is a not only an unstable system

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
but it also is a non-minimum phase

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,919
system with a right half plane zero and

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,440
the sensitivity cannot be made any lower

117
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,479
than this quantity so in particular you

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
can see that the distance between the

119
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,080
right half flame pole and zero the

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,639
smaller it is the larger this quantity

121
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
is in fact when they're on top of each

122
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,199
other the system is not

123
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,639
stabilizable so but even when they're

124
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,039
not on top of each other but close the

125
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,479
system has very very high sensitivity

126
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,120
now you can relate in this paper that's

127
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,919
uh uh it's laid out in detail how the um

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,000
the right half plane pole doesn't depend

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,600
on velocity but the right half plane

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
zero depends on the velocity the Nom

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,560
remember this is linearized Dynamics

132
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,960
around a particular velocity so for High

133
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,160
Velocity it's uh it goes out further to

134
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,919
the to the right uh this is this is less

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,840
sensitivity than low velocity and in

136
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,199
fact this is the only way you could

137
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,039
write this bike the people who have been

138
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,560
able to ride this bike I tried but I

139
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,840
couldn't several times is you run along

140
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,599
with the bike at a certain velocity and

141
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,319
then you jump on it and you start

142
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,960
pedling like crazy and and you could if

143
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,440
you're if you're good enough you could

144
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,800
sort of maintain decent control but you

145
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,919
when you get to the end of the road you

146
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,680
have to slow down and you can see this

147
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
repeatedly when people trying to ride

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,680
this bike as the velocity decreases you

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,440
kind of lose control and you fall off so

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,280
in a way this tells you roughly the um

151
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,039
performance limitations now the

152
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,360
distances between the pole and the zero

153
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,520
and so on are related to the geometry of

154
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,759
the bike uh for example it is U so here

155
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,039
let me see so it is related to the fork

156
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,039
angle the center where the center of

157
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,000
gravity is and so on So based on those

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,639
relations which are fairly easy to

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,680
derive what you could do is you could

160
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,400
redesign rear steering work this is a

161
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,960
redesigned rear steering bike looks very

162
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
funny uh in fact the higher the center

163
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,840
of gravity the further are the distances

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,240
between the pole and zero uh and the

165
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,360
further to the front that center of

166
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,360
gravity is again the further the

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
distance between the pole and zero So

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,160
based on these

169
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,919
relations uh and the limitations on the

170
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,280
sensitivity you can actually redesign

171
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,879
the bike to be more easy easily

172
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,560
controllable so the optimal control

173
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,199
design or the limitations on performance

174
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,039
were useful not in designing the

175
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,319
controller but in redesigning the plant

176
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,479
so that it is more easy to control right

177
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:50,159
so now you don't have to be very skilled

178
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:52,280
to ride this bike okay so again so this

179
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,960
is you know this is well known to

180
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,759
overcome these limitations you can add

181
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,639
sensors and actuators but here this is

182
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,400
an example of actually redesigning the

183
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,520
plant

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,039
so uh so this is kind of a an

185
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,599
interesting point to ponder in the

186
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:12,080
current ERA of data driven control and

187
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,639
model predictive control reinforcement

188
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,440
learning Etc what seems to be happening

189
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,599
one way to understand it is that the

190
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,159
controller design itself you give me a

191
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,599
plant and then I design the controller

192
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:27,840
that process is being automated through

193
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,120
data driven techniques or model

194
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,159
predictive control and so on uh so what

195
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,880
is the utility of optimal or robust

196
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:39,320
control and you know this was a a point

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,800
that was kind of known in the 80s and

198
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,720
90s but seems to be not fully

199
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,160
appreciated in the in the networks

200
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,040
literature is that you really use

201
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,240
optimal control to characterize when is

202
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,440
a good what is a good plant easy to

203
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,360
control when is it easy to control once

204
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,480
you use those techniques to design a

205
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,560
good plant like I did with the uh like

206
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,480
like it was done with the bicycle

207
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,640
example then essentially any good

208
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,839
controller any well-designed controller

209
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,640
does not have to be optimal will work

210
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,600
well so optimal control really should

211
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,800
you should be thought of as a way to re

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,920
sort of doing co-design of the plant and

213
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,440
the controller but actually more

214
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,519
importantly the plant itself and then

215
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,160
any decent controller will work on a

216
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
well-designed plant all right so this

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,320
actually John Doyle used to say this all

218
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,079
the time uh B basically design use

219
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,160
optimal and robust control tools to

220
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:38,279
design a good plant and then a p ID say

221
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,120
controller will work well reasonably any

222
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,920
reasonably designed controller

223
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,000
so uh that's the point I would like to

224
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,079
make about these constrained distributed

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,079
optimal control problems which are hard

226
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,120
and and non-convex you use them to

227
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,560
characterize when is a network easy to

228
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,720
control so this is a question of network

229
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,360
controllability that may be addressable

230
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,320
by looking at constrained distributed

231
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,120
optimal control uh in engineered systems

232
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,600
it tells you how to design the network

233
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,120
structures and maybe in natural networks

234
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,720
it can tell you why the network evolved

235
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,480
to have that structure in the first

236
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,079
place so this is very ambitious I'm not

237
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,279
going to be able to answer this question

238
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,000
in general but I'm going to give you uh

239
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,200
three different manifestations of this

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,720
kind of thinking uh I'm going to talk

241
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,480
about architectural features and

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,240
distributed control that come for free

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
uh and then I'm going to talk about

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,160
constraints that can be tractivity

245
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,639
imposed meaning lead to convex problems

246
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,480
uh and those give some insights and then

247
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm going to talk about large scale

248
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,639
networks and architectures that have

249
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,839
fragility which means you need to do

250
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,519
something about that architecture change

251
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,360
it to introduce easy of ease of

252
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,600
controlability okay so that's so these

253
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,839
are going to be particular case studies

254
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,000
not an overarching Theory but I think

255
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,079
kind of lead maybe to the directions

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,079
You' want to go if you want to form an

257
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,639
overarching Theory so let me go back to

258
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,320
theme one which is the analogies between

259
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:15,720
networks and pdes so this is the

260
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,160
standard consensus algorithm on a graph

261
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,360
I don't think I think I don't need to

262
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,399
describe that to this audience but this

263
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,360
is the laian uh Matrix of a network uh

264
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,240
that is the so here's an example of this

265
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,800
you start with a quantity at some node

266
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,040
and it diffuses over the network this is

267
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
effectively the network version of the

268
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,680
diffusion

269
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,880
equation um when you have consensus in

270
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,480
directed networks under some assumptions

271
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,120
no Cycles Etc you can think about this

272
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,200
as a combination of advection defusion

273
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,000
on a

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,600
network

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,240
um so you could also have which is some

276
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,760
people uh look at consensus with

277
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,839
additive

278
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,200
noise uh in you know that corresponds to

279
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,760
the diffusion equation with random

280
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,399
Fields time varying and spatially

281
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,800
varying random Fields uh in physics this

282
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,680
is called the Edwards Wilkinson equation

283
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,160
which in 1D describes the Dynamics of a

284
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,320
long polymer chain in sort of in L ofan

285
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
forces uh you can think of this as

286
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,279
additive uncertainty now you can think

287
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,600
about a uh consensus for example with

288
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,839
random link failures where the structure

289
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
of the network is changing

290
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,000
stochastically in time the counter part

291
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,440
of that would be uh diffusion in a

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,839
medium whose diffusion constant could be

293
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,720
time varying and spatially varying so in

294
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,880
physics this is called diffusion in

295
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,000
disordered

296
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,079
media um and you can

297
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,639
combine uh sort of media disorder

298
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,160
together with additive uncertainty uh

299
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,760
and you can think of it you know the

300
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,120
Continuum version of that is this uh

301
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,880
this kind of this kind of Dynamics even

302
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,720
though it looks uh a little bit looks

303
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,720
simple it's linear but with random

304
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,680
coefficients can actually have extremely

305
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,800
rich Behavior so nikolia and and Wang

306
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,560
and and others have shown that even when

307
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,480
this uncertainty is gaussian you can

308
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,560
have behavior that leads to heavy tals

309
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,360
and Levy flights and so on uh so it has

310
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,760
a very rich

311
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,320
phenomenology um another set of examples

312
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,959
this is the famous sort of V strings

313
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,600
otherwise people call them vular platoon

314
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,240
but since these days I'm allergic to all

315
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,800
military metaphors I'm going to call

316
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,079
them military strings instead uh so

317
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,480
sorry I mean vehicle strings uh so here

318
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,519
let's say you have a a string of

319
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,720
vehicles on a freeway the objective is

320
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,440
to go at a constant velocity trajectory

321
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
and you want to you say do velocity

322
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,800
position and velocity feedback and if

323
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
you close the loop on velocity and

324
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,279
position feedback you get a model that

325
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,920
looks like this where the matrices K and

326
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,839
F are the feedbacks on all velocities

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,759
and positions and they kind of look they

328
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,399
look like Lans and I'll talk about this

329
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,199
in a little bit more

330
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,560
detail you can also have the problem of

331
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,040
phas synchronization in transmission

332
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,079
networks and the model looks very Sim

333
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,600
similar like this this is the linearized

334
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,839
swing equations of power networks they

335
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,759
have a very similar structure to this

336
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,880
equation um the analogy here is with the

337
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,759
wave equation so here this is the wave

338
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,880
equation with what's called Kelvin V

339
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,360
damping and this is the uh for the case

340
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,279
we're here the damping term is constant

341
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,240
times the identity this is kind of

342
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,240
viscous damping uh but again these

343
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,920
Systems Support wav like phenomena and

344
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,199
so it's not surprising that they are

345
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:58,279
analogous to the wave equation all

346
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,920
right uh so let me talk about um uh

347
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,480
these three different different uh

348
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,959
aspects of the problem so I'll talk

349
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,680
about uh architecture features that come

350
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,079
for free and how you could use them

351
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,240
maybe to characterize limits of

352
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,440
performance so let's look at a very

353
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,079
simple

354
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,120
example uh I want to do distributed

355
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,800
control of diffusion so think about a

356
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,920
bar that is being where the temperature

357
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,680
is being controlled by a heat input

358
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,680
which is your control U of XT uh this is

359
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,440
an idealization of course just to

360
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,759
understand limits of performance often

361
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,199
you don't have that many

362
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:39,040
actuators um and the performance

363
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,560
objective may be something like lqr so

364
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,720
here you would integrate in both space

365
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,199
and time and you can think about this as

366
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,040
an inner product in the space L2 over

367
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:53,160
over space uh and then integral in time

368
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,279
0 to Infinity uh so one of the things

369
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,639
that are easy to show is that if in an

370
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,759
lqr problem you're a b q and r operators

371
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,800
are translation invariant here

372
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,319
translation invariant with respect to

373
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,839
space then necessarily the solutions of

374
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,639
the uh R operator radi equation for this

375
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,800
problem is will also inherit that

376
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,000
spatial

377
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,920
invariance um here's an example so so

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,600
then the optimal

379
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:27,160
control is an integral in space uh at

380
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,000
each time so it's memoryless in time and

381
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,440
in space it's given by say a a kernel

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,959
that represents the spatial action on

383
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,000
the state to produce the control by the

384
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:43,120
way in in throughout this talk the state

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,440
is denoted by sigh not x x is a

386
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,680
positioned coordinate so that's

387
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,639
important to keep in mind um so uh

388
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,720
transition invariance means that the

389
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,079
integral kernel of this operator is

390
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,319
toets so it has the structure that is

391
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:03,360
shown here um and

392
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:05,919
and so what that means is that the

393
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,199
control for this at this particular

394
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,079
location is given by a convolution

395
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,319
kernel because a toets operator acting

396
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,439
as an integral kernel is equivalent to a

397
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,199
convolution in space so the control at

398
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,880
this point takes the state everywhere

399
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,480
and convolves it the control over here

400
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,640
has the same convolution kernel acting

401
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,960
on a shifted version of the state so

402
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,360
that's the implication of the uh

403
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,000
translation in

404
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,679
variance uh you can this is quite

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,640
General so if you have a sort of a

406
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,080
homogeneous medium with an actuator

407
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,600
sensus array that's has some regular

408
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,640
pattern you can describe that as sort of

409
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,880
equivariance with respect to a group

410
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,760
action and then the first architectural

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,480
feature that you can show about this is

412
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,840
that the optimal controller will inherit

413
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,240
that spatial invariance or this the equ

414
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,039
facial equivariance more accurately and

415
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,280
so the controller can also have a very

416
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:08,080
special

417
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,559
structure and which is related to the

418
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,080
equivalent structure of the medium that

419
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,880
you're trying to control uh this is not

420
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,960
too difficult to show but um but the

421
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,679
point of this is let's forget about the

422
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,120
proof once you realize this then you

423
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,039
don't have to actually Implement an

424
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,760
optimal controller you can implement the

425
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,120
same sort of convolution structure with

426
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,320
pids for example okay and that is sort

427
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,360
of something that uh this sort of the

428
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,840
this architectural feature enables you

429
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,640
to do

430
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,520
right

431
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,240
uh so you can also do this in bonded

432
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,400
domains let me let me skip that because

433
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,400
I have a lot of material to get through

434
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
uh so this is not restricted to only

435
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,400
infinite domains over groups it's it's

436
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,200
it's a little more General but there's

437
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,559
another architectural feature with which

438
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,159
is very important and that's the uh

439
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,520
these the Decay properties of these

440
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,760
kernels so again uh let me tell you how

441
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,960
this is solved uh and it's very very

442
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,320
simple uh so because of the translation

443
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,400
in variance in space take a for

444
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,200
transform in space and now you have a

445
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,960
differential equation in time uh that is

446
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,720
algebraic in space Lambda is the spatial

447
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,840
wave number so that's spatial frequency

448
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,919
so this is a very simple parameterized

449
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,679
family of first order

450
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,960
equations uh you can do the same thing

451
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,919
with the performance objective and then

452
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,600
your ratti equation becomes a

453
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,080
parameterized family in this case of

454
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,960
scalar uh Rat equation which is a

455
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,960
quadratic equation which back in middle

456
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,400
school you all learned is solved by the

457
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,120
quadratic formula so that's quite easy

458
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,520
to do at every Lambda so you get a

459
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,159
parameterized family now in fua space of

460
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,159
the ratti equation solution as well as

461
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:05,880
the feedback back uh gain

462
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,640
now this the feedback gain in Fier space

463
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,440
spatial Fu space is an irrational

464
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,080
function so it doesn't correspond to a

465
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,120
PD operator but rather an convolution

466
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,919
operator and then the key question is

467
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,480
what is

468
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,720
that oh come on okay that's that's that

469
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,840
was an important uh figure that it's not

470
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,280
uh rendering but I'll try to describe it

471
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,120
um

472
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,200
so you could

473
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,000
um you could here um take this uh Fier

474
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,000
symbol and you can extend it into the

475
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,720
complex plane the over through a extend

476
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,760
it to a strip around the imaginary axis

477
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,640
and the extent of the strip tells you

478
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,120
the Decay rate in space of the

479
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,720
convolution kernel yes so if I

480
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,080
understand this correctly related to

481
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,799
what the with the topic was at the

482
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,440
beginning you're saying that the of

483
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,240
controlling this problem is related to

484
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:08,200
the spatial dependence that the system

485
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:13,159
has uh what I'm trying to say is that

486
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,159
the um if you think about this kernel

487
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,120
here right the the Decay rate away from

488
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,720
the diagonal uh determines how far you

489
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,400
should look for how far you should do

490
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,960
state feedback so if it's very small you

491
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,159
can kind of truncate it and and be local

492
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,799
so the Decay rate is a proxy for how

493
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,840
localized the optimal centralized

494
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,159
controller is that's something you get

495
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,080
for free right and I'm going to show you

496
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:43,600
the dependence on the various system

497
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,240
parameters of that right so that's why

498
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,360
characterizing the Decay rate is

499
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,440
important but in this particular case uh

500
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,039
again because of this analytic extension

501
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,480
idea the the Decay rate of course is

502
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,919
related to the abscissa of these Branch

503
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,640
Cuts related to the square root and so

504
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,840
you can characterize it in terms of the

505
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,880
system

506
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,240
parameters here because it's very easy

507
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,640
to find the branch cuts of this square

508
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,400
root uh so this is this is quite General

509
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,880
you don't need special invariance for

510
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,919
this uh this is a much more general

511
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,320
property about the natural decay of

512
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,320
centralized controllers but this kind of

513
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,720
characterization in terms of system

514
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,600
parameters is something that you only

515
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,080
get with spatially invariant and this F

516
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,880
technique Fu transform technique and I'm

517
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,159
this is an important point I want to

518
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,840
make so let's look at what happens to

519
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,159
the Decay rate uh for example it's

520
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,360
related to this quantity so if this goes

521
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,440
to Infinity uh you get very rapid Decay

522
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,559
and if it goes to zero you get a very

523
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,520
fat kernel so that requires information

524
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,679
from far away uh special cases uh if you

525
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,320
look at Q over R going to Infinity which

526
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:59,200
is the cheap control case it tells you

527
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,039
that your K is almost decentralized

528
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,600
so if you have cheap control which means

529
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,320
you can tolerate large control signals

530
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,840
you don't need to look far away but

531
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,240
alternatively if control is expensive uh

532
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,200
then the kernel is highly centralized

533
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,600
which means the optimal controller wants

534
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,559
to gather information from far away

535
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,720
that's how it compensates for the lack

536
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:28,080
of local actuator Authority

537
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,840
um so but you can actually uh look at do

538
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,600
a little bit further analysis and look

539
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,400
at the uh the role the plant plant

540
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,120
Dynamics also Play Because here I

541
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,760
assumed Alpha and beta be uh to be one

542
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,480
and let's just step back for a minute um

543
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,720
in other areas of engineering you use

544
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,279
these sort of non-dimensional Quant

545
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,520
numbers like the rolds number or you

546
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,120
look for various length scales in the

547
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,600
problem to give you insight for example

548
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,000
the rolds number allows you to

549
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,919
understand the phenomenology of a LGE

550
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,279
ship uh by doing a lab scale model that

551
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:09,440
are matched to the same renals number

552
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:11,799
and that's extremely useful uh so you

553
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,000
finding these non-dimensional numbers is

554
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,600
very important in addition you also look

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,039
for characteristic length and time

556
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,840
scales that characterize your problem so

557
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,240
we don't do that very much in controls

558
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,720
but I think it's very useful as I'll

559
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,320
show you in a in a second so for example

560
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,279
signal to noise ratio is one such

561
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,919
non-dimensional number that is extremely

562
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,799
useful right

563
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,440
uh so I'm going to do this very quickly

564
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,480
but you could do some sort of uh unit

565
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,320
analysis of the lqr problem and bring in

566
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,440
the roles of Alpha and B in this case

567
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,640
but basically it boils down to this your

568
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,919
uh controller's characteristic length

569
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,240
scale that is how far the kernel uh uh

570
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,960
is spread is actually depending on one

571
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,080
over this number which has to do with

572
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,960
the actuator of Authority rate divided

573
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,760
by the diffusion rate and so if

574
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,840
diffusion is fast and you also have high

575
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,360
actuator Authority that gives you the

576
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,159
sort of the same length scale so both

577
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,279
the speed of diffusion as well as the

578
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,640
actuator Authority both play a role in

579
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,840
determining the um the renal number the

580
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,279
not the renal number the length scale so

581
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,360
fast open loop diffusion gives you more

582
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,600
centralized kernel because the Dynamics

583
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,880
of the plant are spreading information

584
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,080
disturbances very quickly and so the

585
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,799
controller has to gather information

586
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,320
from far away and high actuator

587
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,960
Authority makes you more localized but

588
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,919
both of these have to be taken into

589
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,080
account and the length scale depends on

590
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,480
the ratio of both okay uh you could do

591
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,159
the same thing for the wave equation so

592
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,840
you might imagine that this is actually

593
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,080
quite useful for understanding how to

594
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,760
size your

595
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,440
actuators uh for a particular problem

596
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,960
like this there's another version of

597
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,720
this that was done by hunal arales who

598
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,279
was a student here two years ago uh of

599
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Ali jbai and pekos soy and she looked at

600
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,720
the calman filter version of this

601
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,480
problem and the calman filter is

602
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,000
characterized by both the process noise

603
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,919
and the measurement noise and uh and

604
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
then you know you could do the same sort

605
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,200
of

606
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,559
analysis uh and you can find a a length

607
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,679
scale for the filter uh for example if

608
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,880
you have fast open loop diffusion you

609
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,520
have a more centralized skur this is the

610
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,240
this is the cman gain this is the kernel

611
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,120
of the cman gain in The Observer and so

612
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,039
that requ that tells you how far the

613
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,399
cman filter needs to gather information

614
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,720
to give you estimate of your local

615
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:54,159
state um and then if you distrust the

616
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,640
model for example large process noise

617
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,399
then your kernel gets localized it's not

618
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,640
useful to gather information from far

619
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,320
away because your model could actually

620
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,000
be quite wrong so your estimate of the

621
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,000
local state may not benefit from

622
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,120
information from far away since their

623
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,159
model is is quite different uh again you

624
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,279
could uh and you could sort of do a

625
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,120
branch Locus analysis similar to what I

626
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,559
showed you to determine analyticity

627
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,559
regions and determine the spread of the

628
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,919
cernal uh and in in that case uh you get

629
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:27,240
some interesting observations that Kunal

630
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:30,760
made uh so for example there's a

631
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,840
particular set of parameters where the

632
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,640
common filter is completely

633
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,520
decentralized its performance is

634
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,320
actually quite bad but the optimal thing

635
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,399
is completely decentralized in that case

636
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,000
the the measurement noise is spatially

637
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:49,080
correlated and it kind of conspires with

638
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,480
the pl Dynamics so that neighboring

639
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,440
measurements can only make your estimate

640
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,320
worse which is kind of an interesting

641
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,159
observation that we didn't really see

642
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,960
before doing this kind of non

643
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,960
dimensional

644
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:07,640
analysis all right so um again these are

645
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,679
very useful exercises in terms of

646
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,679
understanding the performance

647
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:17,519
limitations of your optimal centralized

648
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:20,679
estimator um so here are um so now the

649
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,159
second um and I'm going to this is okay

650
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,039
I'm going to try to skip through this

651
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,440
I'm just going to mention one important

652
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,840
aspect of

653
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,720
this uh so I want to do constrained

654
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,919
controller design so what I told you

655
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,399
before are the features that come from

656
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,080
free the centralized controller the

657
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,240
centralized estimator has these

658
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,279
properties what if I want to impose

659
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,120
properties now so I want the uh

660
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,760
estimator or the controller to have uh

661
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,840
constraints on the spatial information

662
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,399
of spatial spread of

663
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,480
information um so one thing that is

664
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,039
quite common to do is to look at a sort

665
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,159
of a standard problem of robust control

666
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,080
after the Ula parameterization becomes a

667
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:07,799
model matching problem and the question

668
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,559
would be now since the model matching

669
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,880
problem involves the Ula parameter Q you

670
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,679
can ask if I impose constraints on the

671
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,000
controller say controller only looks at

672
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,519
in a network problem only to the

673
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
neighbors uh does that correspond to

674
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:26,000
nice constraints on Q and the answer is

675
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,720
generally no but there are special cases

676
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,559
I want to talk about one of them because

677
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,760
that's kind of

678
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,919
insightful uh another area that's become

679
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,480
common today is related to what's called

680
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,159
what I would call closed loop synthesis

681
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:46,360
so it was known um you know since the

682
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:50,640
80s that if you look at the um input

683
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,760
output uh closed loop and you look at

684
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
stabilizing controllers then you get

685
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,760
these aine constraints the set of

686
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,320
stabilized closed Loops is an aine set

687
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,039
but the constraints the aine constraints

688
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
that describe it are really kind of

689
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,159
horrible they involve in the myo case

690
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,200
interpolation constraints with right

691
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,760
zero directions and left zero directions

692
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,679
and so on so recently a new framework

693
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,519
was proposed uh by nuc matney John Dole

694
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,799
and wank uh which they call system level

695
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,200
synthesis uh which is not in my opinion

696
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,120
a very descriptive name but really it's

697
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,200
a it's a variation on closed loop

698
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,880
synthesis where the rather than putting

699
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,600
the constraints on the full closed loop

700
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,320
put the constraints on a portion of it

701
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,360
and then the constraints become these

702
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,640
very nice sort of apine constraints that

703
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,320
don't involve right half plane PS in

704
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,559
zeros and zero directions so they're

705
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,880
much more simple to implement

706
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,440
numerically so that's one aspect of it

707
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
and there's another aspect in the two

708
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,279
are independent of each other even

709
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,120
though often they're discussed in tandem

710
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,639
is that the once you design the closed

711
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,480
loop that now satisfies the certain

712
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:03,519
structural constraints say again nearest

713
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,080
neighbor for the closed loop you can

714
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,120
then get a controller implementation

715
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,200
that also satisfies that same con uh

716
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,120
it's not optimal it's a relaxation in

717
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,320
general unless you look at certain

718
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,799
classes of problems but it is a way to

719
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:22,320
get you constrained controllers from uh

720
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,720
in a convex manner I'm not going to talk

721
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,399
about this I'm going to talk briefly

722
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,639
about uh this

723
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,919
problem so

724
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:33,720
so this actually uh goes back to the

725
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:33,720
work of petus

726
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,559
vulgaris who are the student at Lids

727
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:43,320
back back in the um in the 80s actually

728
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,039
uh and then the the idea is that if if

729
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,600
if I look at the set of constraints on

730
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,519
K and that set was closed under

731
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,600
additions compositions and

732
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,240
inversions uh then it's closed under

733
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,399
feedback and if you think about the ula

734
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,559
parameterization in the stable case that

735
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,679
means I can go back and forth between K

736
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:08,600
and Q and uh by in by additions and

737
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:12,960
inversions uh and products and so the

738
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,720
same set of constraints apply on K and Q

739
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,360
if and only if and so the problem

740
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,240
becomes uh uh in some sense if I have

741
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,480
convex constraints on K then I get

742
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,720
convex constraints on Q and then the

743
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,519
model matching problem is is linear iine

744
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,639
and so the problem is convex uh so for

745
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,600
example is lower triangular MOS systems

746
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:35,960
uh symmetric Etc but an important

747
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,440
counter example which you want is banded

748
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,679
a banded controller which for example in

749
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,679
a linear chain would be nearest neighbor

750
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,519
that's not closed under these

751
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,960
constraints so that doesn't uh it's not

752
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,240
in this class nonetheless uh this is

753
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,080
interesting then riten provided a

754
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,919
generalization of this where you don't

755
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,559
really need closure under products but

756
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:02,799
closure under this sort of quadratic uh

757
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:05,399
form and they called it quadratic

758
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,639
invariance uh you could do the unstable

759
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,840
case of course it follows uh but let me

760
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:11,480
show you what it means in for spatial

761
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,919
temporal systems because that gives you

762
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,000
a little bit of

763
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,840
insight so let's look at the wave

764
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,120
equation again with an input U and the

765
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,880
output is s the state and that's the

766
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,760
wave equation with wave speed C if you

767
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,519
look at its impulse response or this

768
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,519
spatial tempor impulse response you get

769
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,639
an input output description uh of the

770
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,120
system from U to Y and basically it's a

771
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,120
spatial tempor

772
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,559
convolution and if you think about the

773
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,039
spatial temporal impulse response H it

774
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,760
tells you something about how an input

775
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:46,200
will spread out in space and time and

776
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,519
the impulse response for the wave

777
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,480
equation looks like this looks like a

778
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,720
cone right and that tells you so

779
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,000
disturbance comes in it doesn't show up

780
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,919
in s until a certain time determined by

781
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,480
the wave speed

782
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,320
so an important quantity to look at is

783
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,279
the support set of this spatial temporal

784
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:10,760
impulse response and here you have uh

785
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,320
con causality for the wave equation and

786
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,280
then think about uh systems whose spal

787
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,040
temporal impulse response belong in a

788
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,599
funnel a funnel meaning that it's made

789
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,280
up of two functions both of which are

790
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:29,440
concave uh and then one can show that

791
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,679
this class is closed under compositions

792
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,079
inversions and feed compositions

793
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,240
feedback and additions and so we call

794
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,879
this funnel causality and what it really

795
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,159
means is the

796
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:44,440
following if you want to let's say

797
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,919
control a system where the plant the has

798
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,520
a certain support set for its spatial

799
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,679
temperary impulse response what that

800
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,960
means is that if a disturbance comes

801
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,359
into somewhere in the plant it takes a

802
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,560
certain speed before it gets to a

803
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,680
location another location in the plant

804
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,280
determined by that speed right um if the

805
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,400
controller funnel contains the plant

806
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,880
funnel so I use a controller that in

807
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,320
which the information within the

808
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,400
controller travels faster than the

809
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,000
disturbances travel in the plant then

810
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,240
that's a convex

811
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,520
problem okay so that tells you I mean it

812
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,880
it tells you that the problem is convex

813
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,400
maybe it's more tractable and so that

814
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,720
tells you kind of an architectural

815
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,280
limitation on the controller that you

816
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,040
need to have a tractable problem you

817
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,040
need the information passing within the

818
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,560
controller to be faster than the

819
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,480
disturbance propagation through through

820
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,400
the

821
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,200
plant uh you can you know there are

822
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:52,640
generalizations of this over graphs uh

823
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,640
that was a done by Randy kogal um but

824
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,280
it's not quite satisfactory right

825
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,280
because compared to the formulas I

826
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,160
showed you for the Decay rate which gave

827
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,160
you a lot of insight what I really would

828
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,319
like is an a formula for uh like the

829
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,079
controller speed divided by the pl plant

830
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:11,119
speed as a kind of a Reynolds number or

831
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,400
a non-dimensional number that

832
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,359
characterizes how difficult the problem

833
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,079
is and we don't really have an explicit

834
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,640
formula for that we just know that the

835
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:24,359
problem is convex when this ratio is

836
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,560
larger than one yeah okay so I'm going

837
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:31,520
to skip this because I'm running out of

838
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,800
time and I want to move to this uh the

839
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,839
third and last topic which I think is is

840
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,839
more recent and more

841
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:42,319
interesting and I want to look at the

842
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,800
scalability of

843
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,640
certain uh Network control problems over

844
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,560
larger

845
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,040
networks um so I'm going to talk briefly

846
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,280
about consensus and vular formations and

847
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,480
then some new work uh related to this

848
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,599
phenomenon called Anderson localization

849
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,640
um so I'm going to mention physics a lot

850
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,079
uh and so the subject of condensed

851
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,920
matter physics is really the study of

852
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,000
large systems of interacting atoms and

853
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,760
molecules um it is not that surprising

854
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,760
that this is related to large scale

855
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,880
Network control problems because there

856
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,319
we're studying large numbers of

857
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,079
interacting Dynamic systems they're not

858
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,839
molecules and atoms they're macro

859
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,520
systems but the certain mathematical

860
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:34,319
patterns are common between the two

861
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,119
Fields uh so here's one problem from

862
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,680
statistical mechanics that's that's

863
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,000
interesting and seems to be and it is

864
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,319
related to the vular strings problem as

865
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,119
I'll show you in a second uh so this is

866
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:48,680
called the problem of harmonic solids so

867
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,480
you you model Atomic luses uh as balls

868
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,960
and springs so this is a completely

869
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,119
classical model of the vibrations within

870
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:01,400
a an atomic uh an a crystal lce say

871
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:04,680
um the terms they used in physics as

872
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,560
short range interactions the atoms are

873
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,480
uh interacting with neighbors only uh if

874
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,720
you think about a network operative

875
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,079
control system think about that is only

876
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,119
local feedback okay so that's the

877
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,720
equivalent term uh the question that

878
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,240
arises is is uh when do you get long

879
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,480
range order so what does that mean in a

880
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,079
crystal

881
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,440
lce the position of an atom here is

882
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,560
correlated with the position of an atom

883
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,839
billions of SES away that's what it

884
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:41,119
means to have a solid Crystal otherwise

885
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:44,079
it's a fluid or a gas so uh in terms of

886
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,760
formation of vehicles or you know uh

887
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,839
schools of fish swimming or uh flocks of

888
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,240
birds this could be thought of as the

889
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,160
rigidity of the

890
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,760
formation and then the question in

891
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,319
physics is how come short range

892
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,800
interactions lead to Long long range

893
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,960
order okay in which structures does this

894
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,960
is this

895
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,079
possible so what is known is that if you

896
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,599
look at uh Crystal lates or regular lses

897
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,119
like basically uh Z to the D in

898
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,359
dimension one and two short range

899
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,040
interaction cannot lead to long range

900
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,480
order but in dimensions three and and

901
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,040
higher uh long range order is possible

902
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
and so as they like to say only solids

903
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,640
can only form in

904
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,599
3D um so similar things appear to hold

905
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,520
in control problems even though control

906
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,760
problems are not really about atoms and

907
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,480
and molecules but let let me show you

908
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,200
the the results for luses so you can

909
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,079
study consensus first order consensus in

910
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,920
this case in the presence of random

911
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,720
disturbances now you don't reach

912
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,720
consensus what you what the best you can

913
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,560
hope for is that all the St wobble

914
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,839
together around some Network mean and

915
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,520
then the variance of this wobble is kind

916
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,800
of the your proxy for rigidity and now

917
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,599
you can Define you know the details you

918
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,680
don't have to pass through this this is

919
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,240
basically average deviation from Network

920
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,920
average at a steady state uh you can

921
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,880
show that that's the 1/ N times the

922
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,280
trace of the pseudo inverse of this

923
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,599
lassan and so it's this quantity which

924
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,839
is one over the all the igen values of

925
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,319
the plin

926
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,880
reciprocals except for the one at zero

927
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,920
of course so it's kind of like the

928
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,480
center of mass of the reciprocal of the

929
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,359
igen values all right so that's easy to

930
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,480
show and then you can calculate them ASM

931
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:45,240
totically as n goes to Infinity for

932
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,240
luses and you see that they scale like

933
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,319
this so in dimension one it scales

934
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,680
unboundedly with the size of the network

935
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,560
in dimension two also unbounded but with

936
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,520
log of n much more slowly but in

937
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,000
dimension three and higher it is bounded

938
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,520
okay

939
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,640
so uh this is very much related to many

940
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,760
other well-known problems like effective

941
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,560
resistance in resistor lates uh random

942
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,400
walks the return uh possibility of a

943
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,760
random walk in D dimensional luses they

944
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,040
always involve calculating a quantity

945
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,440
like this and you can think about this

946
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,119
quantity as basically kind of the

947
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,599
density of igen values or the reciprocal

948
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,760
of the igen values near zero right

949
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,280
that's really what's important it's a in

950
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,359
the physics they call that the density

951
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,400
of States uh and you can calculate that

952
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:44,599
in D dimensional luses this uh quantity

953
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,200
ASM totically behaves like the uh the

954
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:50,480
total mass over a ball with density one

955
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,680
over r s so the density has a

956
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,960
singularity at zero but the total mass

957
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,480
is actually bounded in dimensions three

958
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,480
and higher but in dimension one and two

959
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,880
it is not and that's really the basic

960
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,400
all of the different mathematical

961
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,280
arguments boil down to this right so

962
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,560
that's why it's common in all all of

963
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,760
these other

964
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,760
areas you could do the same thing for uh

965
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,440
for platoon now this is second order

966
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,280
consensus and I'll just tell you quickly

967
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,359
what the answer is so what happens in

968
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,839
platoon is that if you only have local

969
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,440
uh measurements say you have ranging

970
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,200
devices measuring the distance and the

971
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,520
relative Rel distance a relative

972
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,000
velocity to the Vehicles near you uh but

973
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,280
you don't have any absolute measurements

974
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,480
then as you simulate a very large uh

975
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,680
well-designed controlled

976
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,720
formation subject to stochastic

977
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,880
disturbances it wobbles like an

978
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,359
accordion as it's moving down the

979
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,800
freeway and this is sort of a depiction

980
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,880
of that for a 100 vehicles and you can't

981
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,720
get rid of that unless you introduce

982
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,760
something like everybody knows their

983
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,599
distance to the leader some absolute uh

984
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,119
measurement and so you can you can

985
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,119
analyze this uh and there's a mechanical

986
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,079
model

987
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,839
equivalent and basically the problem

988
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,720
becomes this so here I have a an example

989
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,200
but this is it's more General than this

990
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,880
example where my feedback law at each

991
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,599
vehicle is related to the relative

992
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,720
distance and relative velocities ahead

993
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,079
and behind but if I have a speedometer

994
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,599
in this system then I can compare my

995
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,680
velocity to the agreed upon velocity and

996
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,720
I can use that for feedback if I know my

997
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,160
distance in an absolute frame of

998
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,319
reference uh then I can use that

999
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,680
feedback so I'm calling these absolute

1000
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,440
measurements and these are relative

1001
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:48,400
measurements and so it turns out that if

1002
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,359
you add these in uh these green K andf

1003
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,000
are standard llans that have an igen

1004
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,880
value at zero and as n goes to Infinity

1005
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,240
the igen values accumulate towards zero

1006
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,720
but but the absolute measurements shift

1007
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,079
that Spectrum away from zero and then it

1008
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,480
gives you the scalings that you will see

1009
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:10,040
here so if I have absolute position

1010
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,720
absolute velocity that sort of accordian

1011
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,280
motion goes away but if I only have

1012
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,480
relative position absolute velocity then

1013
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,440
the some proxy for that accordion motion

1014
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,880
will scale as n

1015
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,240
unboundedly and if I have a set a flying

1016
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,240
formation for which getting absolute

1017
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,920
velocity is not possible then the

1018
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:36,400
scalings are much worse okay and so what

1019
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,440
that means is that the the Splatoon

1020
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,079
problem or the vehicle strings in 1D

1021
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,760
vehicles on a highway is fundamentally

1022
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:46,000
difficult because of the combination of

1023
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,200
two things the 1D topology and this

1024
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,760
relative

1025
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,800
feedback the inability to have these

1026
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,079
absolute measurements now this is useful

1027
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,599
because it allows you to okay if this is

1028
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,000
going to be the problem

1029
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,160
okay you can't change the topology right

1030
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,960
you're on a lane on a freeway there's

1031
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,079
not much you can do about that right but

1032
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,680
you can maybe do something about this

1033
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,079
this is a thing you want to do something

1034
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,040
about maybe Institute a communication

1035
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,319
systems basically line of sight

1036
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:20,319
Communications and Cascade the the the

1037
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:21,960
measure distances to various Vehicles

1038
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,720
there are many ways you can think about

1039
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,400
ameliorating that but but that really is

1040
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:32,240
what this analysis is useful for

1041
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,920
okay um all right so uh let me skip

1042
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,000
through all of this

1043
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,960
um and I want to talk I want to end by

1044
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,079
talking about uh this question where uh

1045
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,880
I've discussed these additive

1046
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,880
disturbances in harmonic solars and

1047
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,280
vehicular

1048
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,160
platoon uh I want to talk about the role

1049
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,680
of multiplicative disturbances

1050
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,359
multiplicative

1051
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,480
stochasticity right um and this is

1052
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,480
related to another physics problem uh

1053
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,960
which goes by the name of Anderson

1054
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,880
localization so let me describe the

1055
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,640
problem of Anderson localization in the

1056
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,440
simplest mathematical model this is an

1057
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,200
experiment you can all do in mat laab in

1058
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:17,359
uh with very little

1059
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:19,839
effort so consider this Matrix which is

1060
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,599
kind of the lassan of the 1D heat

1061
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,880
equation if you do finite difference

1062
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,079
discretization uh and consider

1063
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,119
perturbing it with a diagonal Randomness

1064
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:34,680
like this right and I want to think

1065
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,040
about and these are IID random variables

1066
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,400
and considering large matrices and I

1067
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,240
must look at the effect of adding this

1068
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,000
Randomness on the igen vectors of this

1069
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,599
Matrix so and look at the igen vectors

1070
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,520
of Matrix before the randomness and

1071
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:52,079
after before the randomness the igen

1072
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,079
vectors here this is a matrix of size

1073
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,920
10,000 and I'm plotting the igen vectors

1074
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,160
they are as you would expect the sign

1075
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,160
dinos

1076
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,200
SWS if I add a little bit of Randomness

1077
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,000
this is what the igen vectors look

1078
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:12,200
like this is on a standard scale and

1079
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,200
this is on a semilog scale so they this

1080
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:18,200
is the first five igen vectors so

1081
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,520
they're Peak they Peak they're very

1082
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,960
narrowly supported they're actually

1083
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,520
supported everywhere as you can see here

1084
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,960
they're very narrowly supported and they

1085
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,720
occur at random locations

1086
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,200
and if you look at a semilog scale you

1087
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,319
see that they actually have this

1088
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,119
characteristic exponential decay away

1089
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:37,119
from the peak so they're highly what's

1090
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:41,200
called

1091
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:45,119
localized um almost surely as n goes to

1092
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,800
Infinity uh localized and so for very

1093
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:51,599
large matrices it takes almost no amount

1094
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:55,680
of Randomness to change the nature of

1095
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:58,559
the igen vectors from this to this so

1096
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,400
the nature of the vectors is very

1097
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,240
fragile so here they're delocalized as

1098
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:08,359
they're called or they have white

1099
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,359
support and here they're very localized

1100
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,440
yes

1101
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,480
um okay you're you're um uh I can answer

1102
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,280
this because if you do the same thing in

1103
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,680
3D and those matrices also have igen

1104
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,160
values close to zero this doesn't

1105
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,760
happen I'll explain this in a minute

1106
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,559
yeah so it's it's really related to the

1107
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,359
structure of the Matrix more so than its

1108
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,280
igen values I can produce another Matrix

1109
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,559
with the same igen values with a

1110
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,240
different structure for which this

1111
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,960
phenomenon does not

1112
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:51,599
occur okay all right so so this is a

1113
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,480
fragility phenomenon now uh the physics

1114
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,839
interpretation of this just to give you

1115
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:00,319
the historical context is as follows uh

1116
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:03,079
so if you think about H not as the um

1117
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,400
the hamiltonian of a of a say in the

1118
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,119
shortener equation and then you add a

1119
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,000
little bit of Randomness that's adding a

1120
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,480
little bit of Randomness to the in the

1121
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,920
potential so the think this is the uh

1122
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,839
wave function of an electron in a medium

1123
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,079
which has slight Randomness in the uh

1124
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:26,119
potential so Randomness in the material

1125
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:31,440
property and um what Anderson showed uh

1126
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:33,599
in 19 58 is that in dimension one uh any

1127
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,640
Randomness with arbitrarily small

1128
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,720
variance will shift the wave function

1129
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,040
from being delocalized meaning the

1130
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,760
electron can be anywhere in the medium

1131
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,280
to this localized which means the

1132
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,160
electron is pinned and sometimes this is

1133
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,760
called the metal insulator

1134
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,640
transition however in dimensions three

1135
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,040
and higher you need a certain threshold

1136
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,760
of the randomness before you see this

1137
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,599
phenomenon of

1138
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,079
localization and so that is again a

1139
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,880
manifestation of the role that the

1140
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,000
dimension or the connectivity of the

1141
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,559
network plays and this happens both in

1142
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,920
discrete networks in Continuum space

1143
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,520
that that's it happens in all of them

1144
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,880
but this is a phenomena of the fragility

1145
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,880
of the igen vectors of a large

1146
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,839
Matrix okay um so so why is this

1147
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,119
important for us uh well this is still

1148
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:32,160
very active area of research to this day

1149
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,559
because the the phenomenology here in

1150
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,440
various Dimensions various types of uh

1151
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,319
uh a um Pro potentials is actually quite

1152
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,760
wide um in semiconductor physics this is

1153
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:47,960
really a very important current research

1154
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,319
problem um but more interestingly for us

1155
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,839
recently it's been discovered that

1156
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,920
localization happens without

1157
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:59,640
Randomness and so uh so I've just

1158
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:03,160
discussed random Ness in media um but

1159
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,880
you can have Randomness due to Geometry

1160
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,440
if you will complex geometry and I don't

1161
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,960
like to use the word complex because it

1162
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,720
just means that you don't really know

1163
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,359
what's going on um but which is true in

1164
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,599
this case and I you'll see in a minute

1165
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:18,920
uh but for lack of a better name it's

1166
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:22,160
it's uh it will happen over non-lattice

1167
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,520
networks with no Randomness but it have

1168
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,119
provided they have a sufficiently

1169
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,040
complex geometry and I'll show you uh a

1170
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,880
an example of this this is currently a

1171
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,480
very active area of research there's a

1172
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,640
Simon collaboration on localization of

1173
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,440
waves people are discovering this in

1174
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,000
Acoustics they're discovering it in in

1175
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,680
various other areas I'm going to show

1176
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,520
you a fascinating example uh in uh

1177
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,200
molecular vibrations in enzymes and then

1178
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,520
I'm going to relate that to uh something

1179
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:55,200
like the swing equations for Power

1180
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,799
Systems so so here's a model so this is

1181
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,240
actually a very interesting paper from

1182
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:04,880
2019 that describes this so you could

1183
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,119
take a uh enzymes are catalysts and

1184
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,680
they're these very large

1185
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,960
biomolecules um they have a there many

1186
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:17,280
of them have a known 3D structure

1187
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,559
through x-ray crystallography and so the

1188
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,559
exact 3D structure the positions of all

1189
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:25,400
the atoms is well known uh you can have

1190
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,559
a model for how this uh molecule

1191
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,160
vibrates CL classical model we just

1192
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,400
think of it again as balls and springs

1193
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,640
and the strength of the Springs are

1194
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,040
related to the interaction between

1195
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,799
different uh atoms so what this work had

1196
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,280
with this paper had done is to take this

1197
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:46,040
model of a molecule as a as a collection

1198
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,760
of masses and springs in

1199
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:53,359
3D the uh an enzyme starts out as a

1200
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,680
chain it's encoded in in DNA so it

1201
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:59,319
started out as a chain of amino acids

1202
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,680
and you can label each element of the

1203
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:04,880
Chain by the original one-dimensional

1204
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,160
order from which it arose before it

1205
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,640
folds and based on that you can come up

1206
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,640
with a lassan matrix depicted here

1207
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:18,040
graphically which shows the so the

1208
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:22,079
dimension here is the index along the

1209
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:24,400
chain of the different amino acids and

1210
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,119
blue dots means there's a spring of

1211
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,720
substanti of sort of above a certain

1212
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,440
Thresh strength and white means there's

1213
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,920
no connection in this 3D structure so

1214
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,640
this is the lassan Matrix of the

1215
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:41,160
vibrations classical vibrations in 3D of

1216
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:44,880
this large set of masses and

1217
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,599
springs now you can look at the modes of

1218
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,640
vibration both the igen values and the

1219
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,240
igen vectors of this llan Matrix gives

1220
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,720
you the vibrational modes and their

1221
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,880
temporal frequencies and what you

1222
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,040
discover is that what they have

1223
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,920
discovered is that at the top of the

1224
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,280
spectrum meaning at the very high

1225
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:07,359
frequency of vibrations which in this

1226
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,040
case are in the range of 2.8 to 3 terz

1227
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,920
the um the this is a depiction of the

1228
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,000
vibrational modes again along the chain

1229
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,319
here you have about 600 elements you the

1230
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,040
igen vectors have peaky locations they

1231
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,160
have very large amplitudes of vibrations

1232
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,960
here but this doesn't tell you very much

1233
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,319
unless you until you look at the 3D

1234
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,359
structure and what you see so these are

1235
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:31,720
these are localized igen vectors because

1236
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:34,000
they're peaked very sharply peaked at

1237
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,280
different locations when you look at the

1238
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,079
3D structure you discover that these all

1239
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,359
of these Peaks are gathered together in

1240
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:45,520
roughly a small location in this

1241
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:47,240
molecule and remarkably what so what

1242
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,319
that what does that mean that means at

1243
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,559
the very high frequencies top of the

1244
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:54,319
spectrum of

1245
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:57,040
vibrations uh the only a certain portion

1246
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,839
of this enzyme that one site

1247
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,799
is vibrating with large amplitude and

1248
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:03,520
the rest of the molecule is basically

1249
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:06,359
not moving at that frequency so

1250
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,799
remarkably those frequencies and those

1251
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:13,480
locations are found to be responsible

1252
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:17,280
for the rate promoting function of the

1253
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,640
enzyme so this molecule was designed so

1254
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,520
that only those sites which are rat

1255
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,079
promoting when which which play the

1256
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:28,599
catalytic function are the ones that

1257
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:30,400
have the large uh amplitude oscillations

1258
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:31,720
at the frequencies that are chemically

1259
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,839
relevant for

1260
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:37,599
catalysis and so here localization is

1261
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:40,400
occurring not because of Randomness

1262
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,319
there's no Randomness in the structure

1263
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,559
right this is a fixed structure it's

1264
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:48,359
happening because of a complex

1265
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:50,920
geometry right and this and so they've

1266
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:52,920
done this for a large number of enzymes

1267
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,240
this is not as surprising here's a

1268
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,480
mathematical sort of abstract

1269
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,160
mathematical explanation for why this

1270
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,680
might happen so if you take theasian

1271
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,000
over a reg irregular domain with a very

1272
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,400
irregular boundary that's my proxy for

1273
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,880
uh complex

1274
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,640
geometry but the Lain itself has no

1275
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,240
Randomness in it it's just constant

1276
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,760
coefficient you do a transformation a

1277
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,799
domain transformation of this complex

1278
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,400
geometry say to the unit

1279
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:25,480
ball and then you look at the transform

1280
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,200
PD operator the complexity of the

1281
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,680
geometry is then reflected into the

1282
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,559
complexity of the diffusion coefficient

1283
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,839
so you end up with an equivalent problem

1284
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,240
on a very nice symmetric region with no

1285
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:38,799
complexity in its geometry but the

1286
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,280
complexity is all in the diffusion

1287
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:44,359
coefficient now so that's appr proxy for

1288
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,319
the randomness of the media so that's

1289
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:49,440
why complex geometry can be thought of

1290
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:52,880
as actually a kind of a complexity in

1291
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,760
the um or this Randomness in the medium

1292
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,599
so we wanted to think about okay I just

1293
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,799
need five more minutes and and I'll be

1294
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,160
done so this is the the most important

1295
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,480
part of the talk I think because this is

1296
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,480
really current work uh we wanted to look

1297
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:11,559
at simp what is the simplest example of

1298
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,960
an nwork uh for which this localization

1299
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:16,000
phenomena of igen vectors occurs and

1300
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,480
does it have implications for

1301
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,640
robustness okay so here's a simple

1302
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,240
example this is an by the way this is

1303
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,720
not a circle this is the the the those

1304
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,319
two nodes are not connected uh but the

1305
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,000
connectivity here is is increasing and

1306
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,240
then it's constant and then decreasing

1307
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,319
this is the what the laian Matrix looks

1308
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,920
like very simple here are the igen

1309
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:42,520
vectors plotted this is a network of

1310
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,760
size 200 so I'm this is the igen vector

1311
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:48,200
in increasing IG value so indexed by

1312
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,000
increasing IG value this is this is

1313
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:53,480
space so that's the site number and you

1314
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,440
see the first 80 roughly the first 80

1315
00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:00,280
igen vectors are peaky they're localized

1316
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,359
and the remainder are kind of not really

1317
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,319
they're spread out over a certain

1318
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:08,160
region uh here's uh here's what the igen

1319
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:11,520
values uh look like and I've labeled

1320
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,240
them by inspection of the ones that are

1321
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,000
peaky versus the ones are not so here's

1322
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,760
an example of a peaky igen vector it

1323
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,200
Peaks very sharply this is IG Vector

1324
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,599
number 20 here's a

1325
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,520
semilog to show you the exponential

1326
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,359
decay rate and here's an example of a

1327
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,680
non Pagen Vector that has a mass that is

1328
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:34,599
spread uh throughout the region of the

1329
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,839
network so I labeled this with blue and

1330
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:39,200
label the localized ones the red that we

1331
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:40,920
have some understanding about why they

1332
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,000
the difference because these have larger

1333
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,400
gaps which are you can relate to the

1334
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,720
Decay rate anyway uh here's another

1335
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,720
example this is another

1336
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,559
Network where now the localized igen

1337
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,520
vectors are actually towards the top of

1338
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:59,640
the spectrum rather than the bottom and

1339
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,799
you can come up with many other

1340
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:05,960
examples so our question is does this

1341
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:08,920
localization of igen vectors have an

1342
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,319
implication for robustness again

1343
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,880
motivated by the Anderson localization

1344
00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:18,200
problem which is a fragility phenomenon

1345
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:20,720
and so you can you know this I'm going

1346
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,760
to uh try to look at this problem in

1347
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:27,160
terms of the so-call pseudo Spectrum so

1348
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,400
uh the standard Spectrum by the way this

1349
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:32,880
is a very nice book by Lloyd trathan on

1350
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,680
Spectra and P Spectra this is basically

1351
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:39,440
robust control uh in the language of

1352
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,720
numerical analysts and and physicists

1353
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,079
where they study this thicken spectrum

1354
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:48,319
of a matrix with the perturbation having

1355
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:49,839
Norm less than Epsilon you can look they

1356
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,599
don't really look at it this way but

1357
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,400
here we're going to look at it this way

1358
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,720
which is a kind of a compressed pudos

1359
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,799
Spectrum uh this object should be very

1360
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:01,640
familiar familar to those of you who uh

1361
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:04,720
took do you do you teach robust control

1362
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:09,039
still here so we submitted this paper

1363
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:11,039
and two reviewers out of uh four uh did

1364
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,400
not understand that this is the same as

1365
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,359
the super level set of the res of the

1366
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:18,960
transfer function uh

1367
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:21,480
anyway do it's good to teach robust

1368
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,839
control so we're going to look at this

1369
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,359
thick and S Spectrum for for this

1370
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:29,400
network which now

1371
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,680
uh I'm going to put this Lan as the

1372
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,440
lloan say of the Swing equations of a

1373
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,480
power Network I'm going to perturb a

1374
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,760
node with the Delta whose Norm is less

1375
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:43,880
than Epsilon and I'm going to look at

1376
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:46,200
the Spectrum of this uh operator so this

1377
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:49,960
is a uh if you look at the Spectrum here

1378
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,760
it's with a small beta it's sled up uh

1379
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,480
along the very to the left of the

1380
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,680
imaginary

1381
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,440
axis if this EI is just the Vector with

1382
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:02,920
just one in the I position and zero

1383
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:06,640
everywhere if I place that in a for a

1384
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:09,280
node in this region so I'm perturbing

1385
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,480
the Dynamics of that generator in this

1386
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,359
region in the localized region and I

1387
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,640
look at the resulting Pudo Spectrum it's

1388
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:18,079
uh here you see a zoomed area it in this

1389
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,880
particular set of parameters it's

1390
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,440
perturbed it goes into the right half

1391
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,839
plane on the other hand if I perturb

1392
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:28,280
with the same value of perturbation a

1393
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:29,480
node in the delocalized region it barely

1394
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,599
has any

1395
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:36,039
effect so in this network oops in this

1396
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,240
network a small perturbation in the

1397
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:40,599
Dynamics of a node in this region has a

1398
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,960
huge effect compared to perturbation of

1399
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:46,520
a node in the delocalized region so

1400
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,839
another manifestation of this fragility

1401
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:51,760
phenomenon that's due to the

1402
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:55,520
localization of the igen vectors of

1403
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,720
aasum right there's no um in some sense

1404
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,079
here the the disorder is not throughout

1405
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,799
the domain the disorder really is

1406
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,200
Randomness in the Dynamics and and

1407
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:08,119
similar things can be shown I'm not

1408
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,039
showing them here for Edge uh dynamical

1409
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:13,319
Edge perturbation so I assume the link

1410
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:15,640
between two nodes can have a dynamic

1411
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:18,359
perturbation a Delta that is dynamic

1412
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,240
with Norm less than Epsilon that link if

1413
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:22,839
it's in the delocalized it's sorry if

1414
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,799
it's in a localized region is has a much

1415
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:26,920
bigger effect and those Effects by the

1416
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:29,079
way the contrast between

1417
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,400
uh the this perturbation this

1418
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,880
perturbation increases as I increase the

1419
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:38,000
network size so this is another

1420
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:42,920
fragility phenomenon uh that is due to

1421
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,480
something new not uh uh not really the

1422
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:48,160
lattice structure because these are not

1423
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,640
lce networks these are networks with in

1424
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,000
quotes complex structure but as you can

1425
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,960
see I don't have to make the structure

1426
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,440
too

1427
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,920
complex uh to to to begin to see this

1428
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,440
phenomenon um so this is something we're

1429
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,680
studying currently it has obvious

1430
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:08,480
implications for Power Systems um

1431
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,079
basically here the network topology

1432
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,039
determines the limits of performance

1433
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,079
again but now limits of performance is

1434
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:18,319
in terms of fragility and robustness

1435
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:22,279
okay so uh sorry I went over time but I

1436
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:27,640
really wanted to get through that and uh

1437
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:27,640
yeah I've I've said all that yes thank
