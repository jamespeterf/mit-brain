1
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,039
So today we're going to turn from the

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,199
analytics and the positive analysis of

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,800
international trade to the normative

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,720
analysis of international trade and

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,560
we're bring our tools of welfare

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,720
analysis to thinking about how we

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,000
evaluate International Trade okay so

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,119
we're going to we're going to start by

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,119
talking about the welfare

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,879
impacts of trade of international trade

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,039
and how we how that helps us think about

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,000
the debate over free trade now we showed

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,920
L what we're going to start with is the

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,960
standard model and the standard model is

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,440
going to show us that free trade

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,760
unambiguously raises social welfare and

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,199
the intuition I'll do that I'll do the

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
graphics in a second the intuition is

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,760
pretty clear which is international

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,000
trade allows for New

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,159
Opportunities where people value Goods

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,840
at more than what they cost to produce

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,960
anytime you have a new

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,560
opportunity where which allows people to

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,799
value a good at more than it's produced

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,560
you raise welfare it's that simple so

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
let's actually see it graphically let's

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,320
go to the market for

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
Roses okay in figure 191 we have the

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,840
market for Roses under artari remember

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,439
our word for no trade you've got and let

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,119
me be very clear this figure and the

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,560
figure show so now doing National trade

34
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,640
we have to be very clear on what kind of

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,759
figure we're looking at this is the

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,600
figure for the US Rose Market okay we're

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
going to look at different figures

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,200
different countries and different Goods

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,159
so it's important to keep track this is

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,079
the figure for the US Rose Market and

41
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,240
this is in figure 191 we have what's

42
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,880
that market look like before trade well

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,040
before trade you have um a domestic

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,840
demand for

45
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,399
roses a domestic supply for Roses you

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,280
get a equilibrium Price p

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,520
a and an equilibrium quantity

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,280
QA and you end up with a consumer and

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,039
producer surplus of the type we derived

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,800
a few lectures ago in a standard Mark in

51
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,840
a standard

52
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,120
market now let's imagine we open up to

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,160
international trade and let's imagine

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,200
that tra comparative advantage is such

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
that the US Imports

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,480
roses remember last time we're talking

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,200
about a two good model like computers

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,519
and Roses now we're just focusing on the

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,440
market for Roses but let's say that two

60
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,640
good model delivered the outcome that

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,159
the US would import roses as it implied

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,920
last time what would that

63
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:45,000
do well Imports do not affect domestic

64
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,239
demand and Supply domestic demand has

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,959
not changed people still want roses

66
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,560
domestic supply has not changed the

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,280
marginal cost of producing a rose has

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,000
not changed just because we can now

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,239
import them from Colombia what's changed

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,239
is the is the equilibrium price which is

71
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,920
now essentially we have lowered the

72
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,640
price by incorporating a new source of

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
outside

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,319
Supply okay another way you could do

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
this it's not you know you could ask

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,840
where's this new line come from Imagine

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,480
you could if you want imagine a new line

78
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,159
which is below the domestic supply line

79
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,319
which is domestic plus International

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
Supply that would be a line parallel to

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,000
the red line and that would intersect

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,840
domestic demand at the price PW so think

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,799
of a new supply curve below that but

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,840
that's not really true so we don't draw

85
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,760
it but that's sort of a way to think

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,239
about how we get to this new price that

87
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,599
by allowing in cheap roses you've

88
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,200
lowered the price and basically people

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:47,040
canot have more roses so now at that new

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,720
price people want C subt roses at that

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,000
new lower International Trade price

92
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,680
people want C subt

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,400
roses

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,680
okay um uh and now we're going to assume

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,680
that world Supply

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,840
here's an important assumption okay this

97
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,680
is a very important assumption often

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,400
made in trade models World Supply is

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,079
perfectly elastic with respect to

100
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,840
domestic markets let me restate that

101
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,560
we're assuming that world

102
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,880
Supply is perfectly elastic with respect

103
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,199
to domestic markets that is this is what

104
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,960
we typically call a small open economy

105
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,720
model small country open economy model

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,560
we're assuming the US is so small that

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,639
demand from the US can't actually affect

108
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,919
the the underlying supply of roses now

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,720
that's not true for many markets us is

110
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,199
that big but for but just think about a

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,840
case where the US is a small enough

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,520
share of the World Market that basically

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,440
it's a bunch of that it's basically like

114
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,919
facing uh a a a perfectly uh uh a market

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,080
with a perfectly competitive perfectly

116
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,800
elastic supply curve so basically the

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
production the key point is we're going

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
to assume the production of roses in the

119
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,120
US doesn't impact world supp supp and

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,840
that's probably true in roses right

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
because we're small we're small producer

122
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,440
of roses so how many Ros are us produced

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,160
didn't really matter for World Supply

124
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,479
it's certainly not true in computers and

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,800
it's sort of unclear about oil okay you

126
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,400
know most oil comes from outside the

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,440
world we do produce some oil here in the

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,720
US but for Rose it's a pretty fair

129
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,319
assumption it's pretty fair to assume

130
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,440
that the domestic supply of roses is

131
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,360
Trivial Rel to the world supply of roses

132
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,960
so we get this flat supply curve so what

133
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:37,600
do we get well the US consumers now want

134
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,880
that should be a q by the way um uh that

135
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,360
should be a q subt uh so the US the US

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,240
consumers now want that change that to

137
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,160
from CCT to Q subt the US consumers now

138
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,080
want Q sub T

139
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,199
roses okay but at that new low price

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,520
domestic producers don't want to supply

141
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,960
cupt remember domestic producers have to

142
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,639
respect their supply curve they only

143
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,440
want to produce where price equals Mar

144
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,319
marginal cost so they're going to

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,199
produce Q subt oh I'm sorry that's what

146
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
I got backwards yes I'm sorry that is C

147
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,960
subt that's what I miss scratch what I

148
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,560
said earlier C subt is domestic quantity

149
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
demanded Q subt is domestic quantity

150
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,039
produced that's what I got wrong so

151
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,599
leave at C subt I was wrong about that Q

152
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,520
subt is domestic quantity supplied C

153
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,680
subt is domestic quantity

154
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,319
demanded okay consumers at this new La

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,280
price low price want C subt producers

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,560
want to produce Q subt what's the

157
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,520
difference the difference is the roses

158
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,840
that come from other countries which we

159
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,840
call

160
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,280
Imports so the Dynamics

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,560
are we open the market to

162
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,120
Colombia because of that the price of

163
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,960
roses

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,800
Falls at that lower price consumers want

165
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,800
see subt

166
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,160
roses producers only want produce Q subt

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,879
roses what's the difference the ones we

168
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,000
import from Columbia okay questions

169
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,080
about

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,039
that got understand that basic graph

171
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,319
because now we're going to use that to

172
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,960
look at

173
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:13,319
welfare now let's go to figure 193 and

174
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,240
think about what are the welfare impacts

175
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,400
of this trade

176
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,919
well here what we have is initially we

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,000
start with domestic Supply and domestic

178
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,919
demand before trade we have QA roses

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,520
being sold in the US at a price PA so

180
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,080
the

181
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,960
pre-trade consumer surplus

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,240
before trade the consumer surplus so

183
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,240
under

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,240
autarchy consumer surplus is

185
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,120
w and producer Surplus is X Plus

186
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,039
y okay that's a producer consumer

187
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,479
surplus before there's

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,039
trade now we open up to trade what

189
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:02,800
happens under Trade is now consumers get

190
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:04,680
to consume C subt so consumer surplus is

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
now

192
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,800
W plus

193
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:17,080
x w + x plus

194
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:20,840
Z consumer surplus is is W plus X Plus

195
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,400
Z producer Surplus has fallen all the

196
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,400
way to

197
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,039
Y okay so basically what we've done is

198
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,120
by expanding the trade we we've done two

199
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,959
things we've transferred

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,200
X from producers to

201
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,919
Consumers but we've added

202
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,719
Z so welfare has gone up it's the

203
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,760
opposite of the Dead weight loss case

204
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,320
the dead weight loss case it with a

205
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,279
minimum wage or other regulation

206
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,480
restrictions we would transfer but we'd

207
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
have an efficiency loss in that transfer

208
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,760
here's a transfer with an efficiency

209
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,800
gain this the opposite of those cases

210
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,800
remember before whenever you saw

211
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,519
transfers before they came along with

212
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,600
deadweight losses here's a transfer that

213
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,000
comes along with the Dead We with the

214
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,040
gain okay we've now transferred X to

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,399
Consumers but also given them Z so

216
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,839
consumers

217
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,200
win by a lot and producers

218
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,200
lose okay and that's the welfare

219
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,880
analysis of international trade of

220
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,200
imports questions about

221
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
that consumers win producers lose

222
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,640
consumers win because they get a ton of

223
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,399
cheap

224
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,959
roses consu producers lose because they

225
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,160
lose that production

226
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,320
to

227
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
colia now of course International Trade

228
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,279
consists of both imports and exports

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,680
let's look at

230
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,959
exports so now let's turn to the market

231
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,959
for

232
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,800
computers okay now we have a 194

233
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,079
computers now here we're gonna we're

234
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,360
going to continue to assume World

235
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,560
supplies in perfectly elastic that's

236
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,959
probably wrong the US is big enough to

237
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,240
affect the mark for computers but let's

238
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,120
just assume the US is small for a second

239
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,200
makes life much easier

240
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,959
so what happens is we're initially in

241
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,760
autarchy at Point Q sub a p sub

242
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,399
a now the US says we're going to send a

243
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,360
bunch of the computers we're making in

244
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,440
the US and send them to

245
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,760
Colombia what does that do that means

246
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,240
that there's fewer computers in the US

247
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,720
so the price goes

248
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,079
up okay Supply there's less Supply in

249
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,399
the US the supply curve hasn't changed

250
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,760
underlying marginal costs haven't

251
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,839
changed it's just that they're taking

252
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
some of those

253
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,160
computers that they used to produce for

254
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,320
the US and produced for columia as a

255
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,399
result you move up the supply curve to

256
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,760
the new higher price PW that's the new

257
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,240
higher price once you open up to trade

258
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,160
that's good for the computer producers

259
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,720
they can now sell to more

260
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,639
people so now at that higher

261
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,399
price okay producers want to produce cup

262
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,360
te but consumers only want CES sub te we

263
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,560
flipped it consumers now want to produce

264
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
Q subt the price is up they don't

265
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
produce a lot of computers consumers are

266
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,160
like look computers are more expensive I

267
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,680
don't want the

268
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,560
computers so you end up with Q subt

269
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,760
being

270
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,360
produced C subt being domestically

271
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,160
demanded and the difference is

272
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,959
exports so it's the flip case okay for

273
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,360
imports we open up Columbia they lower

274
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,920
the price of roses you end up with more

275
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,240
cons consumers wanting more roses than

276
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,800
the producers willing to produce you get

277
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Imports with exports we open Market to

278
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Colombia producers in the US produce

279
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,240
fewer computers raise the price goes up

280
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,600
so you have more computers being

281
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,000
produced than people want so prod few

282
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,079
computers they raise the price because

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,600
they can sell at a higher price in the

284
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,519
World Market you have more computers

285
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,959
being produced than people want and you

286
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,680
up with exports now what's the welfare

287
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,959
analysis of exports this is quite

288
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,880
interesting let's go to figure

289
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,959
195 okay under

290
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,240
autarchy what is the consumer surplus

291
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:05,959
well under art tarkey the consumer

292
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,959
surplus is w+

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:13,680
X and what is the producer Surplus it's

294
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,279
y now what happens under Trade well

295
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,680
under Trade you move from PA to PW so

296
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,800
consumer surplus shrinks it's only

297
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,480
W consumers aren't getting as much

298
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,880
Surplus because they're paying more for

299
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:31,040
computers but what's producer Surplus

300
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,040
now well it's X Plus y + z

301
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,959
so we have the flip case now we've

302
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:41,320
transferred Surplus from consumers to

303
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,160
producers and producers have also gotten

304
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,079
Z so it's a transfer with a

305
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,880
gain you've got consumers losing by X

306
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,680
producers winning by X Plus Z total

307
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,279
social welfare goes up by the area

308
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,320
Z so this is kind of bizarre if you

309
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,399
think about it Imports increase social

310
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,560
welfare and exports increase social

311
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,160
welfare it's kind of crazy but it's true

312
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,600
basically both are true because you are

313
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
creating gains from trade by opening up

314
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,839
to New

315
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Market so in either case you get gain

316
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,000
you get welfare increases from

317
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,880
trade this is the fundamental analytics

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,600
of international trade that economists

319
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:31,079
grow up with okay it's whispered to us

320
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,399
at bedtime okay okay free trade is good

321
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,880
why is free trade good free trade is

322
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,040
good because it opens up new

323
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,120
possibilities for welfare improving

324
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,680
trades it opens up new possibilities for

325
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,800
people who value a good to get it at

326
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,240
above what it cost to produce it full

327
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,360
stop okay now you might say well that is

328
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
great we know everybody listens to

329
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,920
Economist of course so that seems the

330
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,920
end of the problem but in fact it's not

331
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,639
in fact if you follow the news at all

332
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,360
you'll know that this is not necessarily

333
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,720
a consensus view that there's a lot of

334
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,240
debate in the policy world and in the

335
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,240
economics World about trade

336
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,839
policy there's a lot of debate about

337
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,079
trade policy let's start with the

338
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,759
simplest

339
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,440
case Imports are a job

340
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:27,079
killer Imports are a job killer why are

341
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,959
Imports a job killer well because since

342
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:33,880
we are growing more rows than Columbia I

343
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:35,959
and fewer here producer Surplus is down

344
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,560
fewer roses are grown in the US so fewer

345
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,560
Rose workers are needed so they get

346
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,000
fired there were presumably thousands of

347
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,720
people employed in producing Ros in the

348
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,120
US that now no longer have a job because

349
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,079
we get them from

350
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,800
Colombia so as a result people say we

351
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,279
should limit Imports because they're

352
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,839
killing American jobs they always use

353
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,399
the word kill it's very violent they're

354
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,560
not you know taking away their Killing

355
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:05,120
American jobs okay so we should that's

356
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,240
the that we should have some limitation

357
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:13,120
trade policy okay so basically for

358
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,480
example we could impose a tariff I

359
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,000
mentioned this earlier in the course a

360
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,720
tariff is a tax on imported goods so we

361
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,480
could say that any roses that come from

362
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,959
Columbia we will tax them so it's a a

363
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
tariff is a specific tax on import

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,040
well as I'll show you in a minute but I

365
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,600
think your intuition could tell you

366
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,399
already this turns out to be a bad idea

367
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,079
because while it does help producers it

368
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,319
hurts consumers more and to see that

369
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,800
let's go to figure

370
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,440
196 now we're back to the market for

371
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,920
Roses the red and blue lines are

372
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,720
autarchy under World Trade we went down

373
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,680
to

374
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,720
PW and we imported Q the difference

375
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,240
between q1 and C1 okay slightly

376
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,079
different slightly different magnitudes

377
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,240
here so once again Under World Trade

378
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:14,560
went from the initial equilibrium down

379
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,079
to PW producers only produced q1 so a

380
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,000
lot of jobs got lost consumers wanted

381
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:22,480
see1 see had a lot of

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,600
imports now we impose a tariff well what

383
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,040
does a tariff do it raises the price of

384
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,279
columia specific roses

385
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,639
in particular if the Tariff was the was

386
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:38,560
the exact difference between P PT I'm

387
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,040
sorry between between the initial price

388
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,319
it's not marked here but PA where the

389
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,079
red and blue lines intersect if the

390
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:47,440
Tariff was the actual difference between

391
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,079
PA the initial the autarchy

392
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,480
price and the world price then you'd

393
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,680
shut down Imports there' be no reason to

394
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,759
import them because you get them from

395
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,360
the same price in the US but that's an

396
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,319
unting case uninteresting case let's

397
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,639
imagine a tariff but it's not quite as

398
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,120
big as the differ

399
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,600
between the price the world price and

400
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,240
the US price so a tariff now of an of an

401
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,600
amount that raises the price from PW to

402
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,480
PT we put in a tariff but it's not

403
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,520
enough to wipe out Colombia's Advantage

404
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,919
it just reduces Columbia's

405
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,720
advantage and why is that a shift up of

406
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,360
the line because essentially we've done

407
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,439
is we've made the imported roses more

408
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:27,319
expensive so that raises the price those

409
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,720
imported roses face so we move now to

410
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,039
PT okay and we move to New equilibrium

411
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,960
where consumers consume fewer roses

412
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:38,440
C2 producers in the US remember it's a

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,080
US

414
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,080
diagram producers in the US produce more

415
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,360
roses Q2 and we end up with a smaller

416
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,120
level of imports after tariff the

417
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,919
Imports have shrunk from C1 minus q1 to

418
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,760
C2 minus Q2 questions about the

419
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,640
analytics I know I'm going fast here

420
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,799
this is sort of a new world so please

421
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,880
stop me if there's questions about this

422
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,640
okay now let's look at the let's then

423
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,200
take that and look at the welfare

424
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,559
analysis of

425
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,080
tariffs well now we're going to compare

426
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:17,600
a world with free trade to a world with

427
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,600
a tariff with free

428
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:24,919
trade we are at q1 and

429
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,320
C1 with the Tariff we've dropped to Q2

430
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,600
and C2 what has happened well by moving

431
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,400
from Q q1 to

432
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,960
Q2 okay we have increased producer

433
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,720
Surplus by

434
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,400
a make sure you see that produ Surplus

435
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,159
up by a why is produ Surplus up by a

436
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,600
because the price is up from PW to PT

437
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,000
and they're selling more roses produc

438
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,400
Surplus is up by

439
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,240
a consumer

440
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,480
surplus however has

441
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:59,480
fallen by b c consumer I'm sorry so

442
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:06,280
consumer surplus has

443
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:08,799
Fallen um by uh by all of uh AB C and D

444
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,200
consumer surplus is down by the entire

445
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,520
trapezoid

446
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,440
ABCD that's all come out of consumer

447
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,200
surplus that's all sales that were under

448
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,400
the demand curve above the price that

449
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,840
are now gone okay so can people see that

450
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,679
whole trapezoid I've added four letters

451
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,320
but it's really just one trapezoid that

452
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,880
whole trapezoid is

453
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,280
gone okay because that's the area under

454
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,520
the demain cover above the price that's

455
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,919
now no longer there so consumers have

456
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,440
transferred a to producers but they've

457
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,240
lost a plus b plus C plus

458
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,159
d now here's the extra

459
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,039
wrinkle C is different than b and

460
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,679
d

461
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,200
c is not dead weight loss normally say

462
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,120
well if producers didn't gain it and

463
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,280
consumers lost it it's dead weight loss

464
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,240
but what have what have we forgotten

465
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,080
here what's the other party in play here

466
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,640
why is this not a deadweight loss rather

467
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,480
a transfer and who's it a transfer to

468
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,960
yeah the government yeah it's a transfer

469
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,120
to the government because the tarist

470
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,960
rais money give her a high five there

471
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,039
she got it okay because the government

472
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,559
raised money all right the government

473
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,760
raises money by this tariff and that's

474
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,200
another transfer so essentially and the

475
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,919
amount of money the government raises is

476
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,039
what well the amount of remaining

477
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,799
Imports C2 minus Q2 times the size of

478
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:28,120
the Tariff which is the rectangle

479
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,240
C so what's happened here is consumers

480
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,600
have lost

481
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,919
AB c

482
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:39,760
d producers have gained

483
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:42,720
a the government has gained C and B plus

484
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,520
d are welfare our dead weight loss so

485
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,000
the Tariff has overall lowered welfare

486
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,919
we are worse

487
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,200
off in order to transfer C to the

488
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,799
government and a to

489
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,240
producers we've given up as well B plus

490
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:02,280
d so we're worse off so Society is worse

491
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,240
off from restricting that okay so the

492
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,039
fundamental a for trade free trade is

493
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,960
once again a barrier to free trade

494
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,840
lowers welfare this is just a corollary

495
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,080
of the previous proof which show the

496
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,520
free trade maximize welfare well here

497
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,559
we're showing how a barrier to free TR

498
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,600
this is operationalizing how does a

499
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,679
barrier to free trade lower

500
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,559
welfare okay questions about

501
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,760
that now that's why economists like free

502
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,480
trade but it's not the only reason

503
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,840
economists like free trade there's two

504
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,360
there's fundamentally three Arguments

505
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,120
for free trade the first of free trade

506
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,799
is the basic welfare

507
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,960
analysis welfare

508
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,240
maximization the second analysis for

509
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,240
tree

510
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,600
trade is

511
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,440
that when you impose that tariff you're

512
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,480
not done because what's going to happen

513
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,480
then what's Colombia going to

514
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,480
do what's Columbia going to do yeah

515
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,279
on Us's what

516
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,279
computers

517
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:09,480
remember our welfare was maximized for

518
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,559
exports by opening up the trade to

519
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,320
exports well Colombia is can to say well

520
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:15,039
screw you got a tariff on my roses I'm G

521
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,960
have a tariff on your computers well I

522
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,840
don't do the example here you should be

523
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,799
able to go back and show yourself how a

524
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,320
Colombian tax tariff on our

525
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,000
exports okay it's going to it's going to

526
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,679
raise the price in Colombia imagine a

527
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,799
Colombian domestic Market just like our

528
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,559
tariff so imagine instead of the market

529
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,240
for roses in the US do the market for

530
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,679
computers and

531
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,799
Colombia what you'll see is a tariff on

532
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,760
us computers will lower the number of

533
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,799
computers sold in Colombia well that

534
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,840
hurts our

535
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,559
producers so by imposing this tariff and

536
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,000
starting a potential trade War which

537
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,880
isn't nearly as cool as it sounds okay

538
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,880
by starting a trade War what we've done

539
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,080
is essentially hurt not only our

540
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,799
consumers we've also hurt our producers

541
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,799
remember the whole idea was to help our

542
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,640
producers but by helping the rose

543
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,720
producers we've now hurt the computer

544
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,760
producers so it's not even clear we

545
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,240
raise producer Surplus at all we clearly

546
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,279
lower consumer surplus it's not clear we

547
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,120
raise producer Surplus at

548
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,600
all okay so first of all the welfare now

549
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,880
is even stronger than you think because

550
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,039
you're missing the fact that if there's

551
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,480
a trade War our exporters get hurt

552
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,760
too second of all what have we forgotten

553
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,720
in our typical American americ

554
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,200
fashion that there's other people out

555
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,559
there in the world that matter

556
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,840
too okay and just as free trade makes us

557
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,919
better it also makes other countries

558
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,120
better so you could redo this whole

559
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,159
analysis I've done you guys have plenty

560
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,400
of free time do it for fun sometime read

561
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,799
this whole analys I've done from

562
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,480
Colombia's perspective and show how

563
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:57,760
opening up to

564
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,760
trade to the US made Colombia better off

565
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,960
it increased consumer surplus more than

566
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,960
producer Surplus for

567
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,679
computers okay and uh I'm sorry for rce

568
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:15,919
Consumer for for for yes for computers

569
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,600
and uh and basic and and for Roses uh

570
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,919
Society also is made better off you can

571
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,480
do the same flip of the analysis and

572
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
show that free trade helped Columbia too

573
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,440
so even if you don't buy the welfare

574
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,679
maximization argument even if you don't

575
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,600
buy the trade argument if you care at

576
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,279
all about people around the world then

577
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,480
that's another for free trade you're not

578
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,120
only helping us you're helping everyone

579
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,960
else okay I have never seen that as

580
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,520
vividly as when I went to Vietnam I

581
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,919
talked about the Vietnam rice example a

582
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,080
few lectures

583
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,520
ago you know Vietnam was in a really

584
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,080
horrific war with the US and it's an

585
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,240
incredibly moving place to go for that

586
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,200
reason especially people of my

587
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,279
generation live through that war but

588
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,520
they love

589
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,760
Americans and they asked why they said

590
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,799
because we were a desperately poor

591
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,840
starving country until you opened to

592
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,279
free trade in 1994 build Clinton's their

593
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,080
hero when you open a free trade in 1994

594
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,360
and allowed us to export our rice to

595
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,120
America it massively incre our wealth

596
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,320
increased our wealth levels and I saw I

597
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,559
showed you one results of that there was

598
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,720
less child labor in Vietnam but

599
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,679
generally their standard L just went way

600
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:20,520
up and it really brought home to me this

601
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,840
argument okay which is that we can help

602
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,440
other countries by allowing free trade

603
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,880
too and we shouldn't forget

604
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,080
that okay now this is it this has if you

605
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,080
think about it this kind of smacks of

606
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,279
the

607
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:37,080
flavor of the Nash model with

608
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,559
non-cooperative and Cooperative

609
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,360
equilibria free trade is a Cooperative

610
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,799
equilibria where we're all better off by

611
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,880
cooperating we're not explicitly forming

612
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:51,919
a a a uh a cartel but we're cooperating

613
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,159
to allow free trade by lowering barriers

614
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,720
to trade we're making everyone better

615
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,000
off whereas the non Afric Li is wow I

616
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
don't want I don't want my guys to lose

617
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,919
job so I'm impose a tariff so you impose

618
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,360
a tariff and we both end up horse off so

619
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,880
this very much feels like Cooperative

620
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,399
versus non-cooperative equilibrium the

621
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,039
Nash model and in fact that's been

622
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,520
realized enough over time that there's

623
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,240
been more and more movement towards free

624
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:19,200
trade so if you look at the

625
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:24,000
decades from really World War II all the

626
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,000
way up to about

627
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,159
2007 was a steady movement towards free

628
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,679
trade around the world

629
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,159
there were arrangements and the way that

630
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,480
was done was by a number of rules that

631
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,520
were set up to impose free trade

632
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,520
essentially the world the companies got

633
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,600
together and formed a cartel and they

634
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,960
said look we're going to make sure we

635
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,399
trade fre each other by setting up rules

636
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,679
that don't allow any one country to

637
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,279
impose tariffs and start a trade War so

638
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,640
it's like a unilateral

639
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,880
disarmament among countries there were

640
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,520
agreements there was the World Trade

641
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,159
Organization was set up which it's

642
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,159
trying to promote free trade by setting

643
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,440
rules that uh setting rules that um have

644
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,919
trade be free around countries there was

645
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,039
very importantly in the US NAFTA the

646
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,120
North American Free Trade Agreement

647
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
which was once again signed in the

648
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,240
Clinton

649
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:15,600
Administration okay which established

650
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,120
virtually taror free trade between

651
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,120
Canada the US and

652
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,480
Mexico and a number of other free trade

653
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,480
agreements were negotiated around the

654
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,640
world and once again let me be very

655
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,000
clear what's stunning from my

656
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,360
perspective is that it was Democrats as

657
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,600
well Republicans were into this when I

658
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,520
grew up Democrats were against free

659
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,960
trade Republicans were for it that

660
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,080
changed Bill Clinton really led the

661
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,360
charge so really we had a world where

662
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,480
there was sort of a universal consensus

663
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,240
for free trade okay now I'm not saying I

664
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,480
shouldn't say Universal there was a lot

665
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,559
of movement plenty people are upset

666
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,120
about it for various reasons I remember

667
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:51,559
my sister graduated univers Chicago in

668
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,080
1999 and Bill Clinton was a presidential

669
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,480
speaker and a bunch of people wouldn't

670
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,799
shake his hand because they didn't like

671
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
the free trade deal he'd signed I

672
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,279
thought that was pretty intense so BAS

673
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,840
basically uh it wasn't Universal

674
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,480
agreement but certainly there was a

675
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,960
large move in that direction for many

676
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,799
many decades and that completely

677
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,840
reversed and It reversed it was starting

678
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,440
to reverse pre-co and it's really

679
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,080
reversed

680
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:21,039
postco okay and basically we are now

681
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,919
moving away from that President Trump

682
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,080
put in a lot of

683
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,120
anti-trade Provisions in particularly a

684
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,120
large tariff on Chinese Goods

685
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,480
and to be honest President Biden has

686
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,399
kept a lot of it I mean he got rid of

687
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,159
some of it but he's kept more than he's

688
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:42,519
gotten rid of in terms of international

689
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:46,399
trade restrictions so it's sort of that

690
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:48,120
we've gone from a cons very rapidly from

691
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,240
a consensus for Inter National trade to

692
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,640
one against and Co made it much much

693
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,279
worse why did Co make it much much worse

694
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,799
because Co exposed the problem with

695
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,440
international trade which is it creates

696
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,840
interdependencies in production chains

697
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,200
you often heard the term supply chain as

698
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,480
a problem what was going wrong during

699
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,440
covid because of free trade we created

700
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,760
production processes that were

701
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,760
integrated around the world and when

702
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,000
trade shut down during covid that's

703
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,600
those Supply process he sort of

704
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,440
collapsed the most Vivid example

705
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,600
semiconductors semiconductors are the

706
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,080
core of every modern thing we own from

707
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,159
our car s phones to now in toilets and

708
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,559
everything okay and I and basically as I

709
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,279
think I mentioned before 75% of all

710
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,519
semiconductors are produced in

711
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:39,039
Taiwan okay and we couldn't get them all

712
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,120
of a sudden and the us and we saw prices

713
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,559
for cars go through the roof I don't if

714
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,600
you know but during Co prices for cars

715
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,519
went up two or three times it largely

716
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,840
just because of the shortage and

717
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,760
semiconductors okay so now there is

718
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,440
basically uh a lot of people arguing

719
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,279
against free trade and what are their

720
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:02,600
basic arguments Okay so why do people

721
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,039
oppose free trade well one argument is

722
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,720
the new one I mentioned which is sort of

723
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,720
supply chain

724
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,760
dependencies supply chain dependencies

725
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,519
slash National

726
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,240
Security so the argument is

727
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,640
look if 75% of semiconductors are

728
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,120
produced within 100 miles of China and

729
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,880
we feel that we might go to war with

730
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,720
China we're pretty screwed if we don't

731
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,679
have a domestic semiconductor

732
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,360
industry well how do you make a domestic

733
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:37,200
semiconductor industry well you can do

734
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,559
two things one is you can tax Chinese

735
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,559
Taiwanese semiconductors but we don't to

736
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,159
do that because Taiwan is an ally of

737
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,679
ours the other thing you could do is you

738
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,080
could subsidize the American

739
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,840
Semiconductor

740
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,399
industry think about the American

741
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,080
Semiconductor industry they are doing

742
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:54,960
the same analys done marginal cost

743
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,320
marginal benefit they're saying look the

744
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,679
truth is at the price point for

745
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,159
Semiconductor today we can't produce

746
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,519
them cheaply enough so we're just going

747
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,039
to let them come from Taiwan what if he

748
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,600
said to them you know what we'll give

749
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,880
you a bunch of money if we produce

750
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,120
semiconductors and might say well if you

751
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,519
give us enough then we can produce them

752
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,399
even if it's we can't compete

753
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,519
effectively with Taiwan and that's what

754
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:17,519
we did we set up we passed the chips

755
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,080
plus science act which puts 52 billion

756
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,639
dollar aside for us domestic

757
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,399
semiconductor

758
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:25,720
manufacturing to try to build that and a

759
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,760
lot of the argument was we don't want to

760
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,320
spend the supply chains that China make

761
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,559
a control and would and part of the

762
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,320
reason is National Security so that's

763
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:37,559
one reason people are proposing free

764
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,760
trade okay the second argument is the

765
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,080
one where economists have probably

766
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,519
fallen down the

767
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,360
most which is we might call this

768
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,360
argument non-compensation of the

769
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,440
losers the basic argument for free trade

770
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,440
that I grew up with runs as follows if

771
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,600
you allow Imports

772
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,279
consumers will gain more than producers

773
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,360
will

774
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:08,159
lose as long as we take some of that

775
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,880
extra and transfer it back to producers

776
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,519
everybody wins let's go up to here

777
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,279
imagine that we move this is with

778
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,880
trade we move to trade remember trade

779
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:22,480
took consumer surplus from W to W plus X

780
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,399
Plus Z produc Surplus from X Plus y to

781
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,720
Y what if we took the x from consumers

782
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,760
and moved it over here

783
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,480
well then what happens consumers are

784
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,760
better off they still have W plus Z

785
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,399
producers are no worse off they're the

786
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,600
same as they were before so we can make

787
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,760
everybody better off we can create no

788
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,840
losers from free trade by simply taking

789
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,880
some of the extra benefits that created

790
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,080
and giving them to the losers it's

791
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,440
theoretically brilliant it's a great way

792
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,919
to argue I free trade's good because as

793
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,159
long as the winners win by more than the

794
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,320
losers lose you can take some of the

795
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,360
winners winnings and give it to the

796
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:04,399
losers keep them whole and everybody's

797
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,559
better off or at least no worse

798
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:12,919
off okay the problem is we haven't done

799
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:15,360
that in theory it works in practice we

800
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:16,919
don't do it and this is made no more

801
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,360
evident than by the fascinating research

802
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,919
of my colleague David

803
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,279
otter David otter who's an outstanding

804
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,919
labor Economist has looked at what

805
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,639
happened around the US due to Rising

806
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,799
imports from China and is a very clever

807
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,679
study where he looks at as looks at

808
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,760
Industries basically Chinese Imports

809
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,720
became much cheaper after he passed the

810
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,919
Free Trade Agreement it looks at

811
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,880
industries that were more and less

812
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,960
susceptible to Chinese Imports and where

813
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,720
they're

814
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,200
located and what he found was the

815
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,840
industries that were most Su set to the

816
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,600
chines Imports basically got crushed and

817
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,760
those communities lost millions and

818
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,080
millions of

819
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,480
jobs now at the same time life for

820
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,559
consumers was great this based on how

821
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,840
walm smart

822
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,200
functions okay I was like you know I've

823
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,399
got this sweater here okay this sweater

824
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,720
you can't really see it's a nice you

825
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:10,280
know it's like mediocre sweater okay

826
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,599
this sweater probably cost me I don't

827
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,040
know 30 bucks okay when I was a kid when

828
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,280
prices were a third of what they are now

829
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,679
the sweater would cost me maybe 40

830
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,520
bucks okay would be 120 today's dollars

831
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,760
why because imports from China because

832
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,280
when I was a kid that had to be made in

833
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,760
North Carolina our textile mills in

834
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,079
North Carolina and they were more

835
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,560
expensive now I get it from China it's

836
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,560
cheap the techy guys had no longer have

837
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,599
jobs well the easy answer is tax me on

838
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,720
my sweater imagine if with this $30

839
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,960
sweater they imposed a $15

840
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,879
tax well I'd still be way better off

841
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,280
than I would have been without trade

842
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,040
this would have been 120 bucks without

843
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,480
trade so I'm still way better off and

844
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,480
that money could have compensated all

845
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,320
the textile workers who lost their jobs

846
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,399
everybody wins but we didn't do

847
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,320
it as a result while theoretically we

848
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,119
can make everybody better off in

849
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,920
practice we

850
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:06,119
haven't and that has led to a lot of

851
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,240
opposition or free trade okay this gets

852
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,520
in a big issue which is well gee

853
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,119
couldn't we just help these texti

854
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,320
workers some other way and we'll talk in

855
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,119
a couple lectures about that that's

856
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,000
about redistribution policy but in

857
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,520
practice that's what least the

858
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,520
opposition

859
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:27,079
yeah that's a great question so that's

860
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,320
the other argument for free trade

861
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,119
actually I should put that is another

862
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,599
argument this sort of relay to the trade

863
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:37,839
War argument for free trade which is

864
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,440
that basically um the idea is economists

865
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,440
say here's another way to think about

866
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,599
this the rose workers lose their jobs if

867
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,359
we train them to be computer

868
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,960
workers then everybody's better off the

869
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,240
rose workers move into a better sector

870
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,480
computer workers make more than Rose

871
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,440
workers consumers in the US get cheaper

872
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,720
roses everybody wins so the way you

873
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,760
could do this is by literally just

874
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,560
retraining workers but that takes money

875
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,480
and we didn't do it and a lot of workers

876
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,440
turns out it's hard to become a computer

877
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,040
programmer okay or you know or you know

878
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,119
uh be electrical engineer you know I

879
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,280
mean you're all studying to do that okay

880
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,760
it's hard for these people who didn't

881
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,760
grow up with proper education or work in

882
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,119
the Rose sector to do that so as a

883
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
result in theory you can do that in

884
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,200
practice we

885
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,280
didn't so that's one big that's a second

886
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
big reason people oppose free trade and

887
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,440
the third reason people oppose free

888
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,640
trade I already talked about last

889
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,119
lecture which is socially damaging

890
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,599
comparative advantage and I talked about

891
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,599
that last

892
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,079
lecture with with Chinese battery plant

893
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,240
and the fact they built this battery

894
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,520
plant and since they have no

895
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,079
environmental regulations the stuff

896
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,760
leaked and killed a bunch of

897
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,720
people okay that's the third issue

898
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,839
finally the last issue and the most

899
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,240
controversial is trade as a foreign

900
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,240
policy tool

901
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,520
which is we have many

902
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,079
reasons okay to be mad at China there's

903
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
many reasons Trump was mad at China now

904
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:14,800
some were're irrational Trump was upset

905
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,240
about our trade deficit with China as I

906
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,920
said that's just a Pikachu deficit we

907
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,440
shouldn't care okay but Trump had

908
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,760
legitimate reasons for being mad at

909
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,119
China for example we have a larger World

910
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,240
Trading System under the World Trade

911
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,880
Organization that as I said is like a

912
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,760
club that imposes a set of free trade

913
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,160
rules to try to have welfare maximizing

914
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,640
trade around the world China's been

915
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,720
violating the rules that organization

916
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,920
repeatedly over and over again China's

917
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,280
been doing things which violate the

918
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,560
rules so for example it says you can't

919
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,920
import any Goods into China that aren't

920
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,760
you could be have foreign Goods in China

921
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,040
but they must be produced in Chinese

922
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,800
factories well that's not free trade if

923
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,160
you say you can't have computers sold in

924
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,400
China by American companies unless you

925
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,119
come here and build a factory here in

926
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,119
China you can own it America

927
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,119
but you got to come here and employ

928
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,920
Chinese workers and build a factory here

929
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,680
well that's against the rules of the WTO

930
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,079
that's against the Free Trade Agreement

931
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,240
and China's been doing that for years

932
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,160
there's also significant industrial

933
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,119
Espionage now I'm not saying we don't do

934
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,400
it too but there's a lot of evidence of

935
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,599
the fact that free trade has opened up

936
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,839
the exposure of our companies to other

937
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,920
countries and they've been studying and

938
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,440
copying our

939
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,640
methods and that's another reason that's

940
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,839
another kind of bad behavior we should

941
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,240
be worried about these are significant

942
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:31,040
problems

943
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,520
so you might say well gee China's a bad

944
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,880
actor why not then slap a tariff on him

945
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,440
why isn't that the right answer and it

946
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,720
turns out it's a bad answer as a way of

947
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,920
getting back at this problem be for

948
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,000
three

949
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,560
reasons there's three reasons why using

950
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,280
trade restrictions as a tool of foreign

951
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,640
policy makes no

952
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:56,040
sense okay reason one is the standard

953
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,040
welfare

954
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,319
analysis which is sure you strike back

955
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,000
at China but along the way you hurt

956
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,000
American

957
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,200
consumers okay indeed um there was a lot

958
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,560
of evidence that the price of goods that

959
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,960
were produced using Chinese Parts went

960
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,880
through the roof once Trump not through

961
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,160
the roof but went up a lot once Trump

962
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,040
raised his

963
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,880
tariffs so that's the first argument the

964
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,240
second

965
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,319
argument is that it's not even clear how

966
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,319
you do this because what is made in

967
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,319
China

968
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:35,680
take a

969
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,520
car where the construction the bodies in

970
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
the US but all the components come from

971
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,200
China is that a Chinese good and

972
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,440
American good and if you POS a tariff on

973
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,400
that you're hurting American car

974
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,800
companies they use that as an input in

975
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,079
their production which will kill

976
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,200
American

977
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,400
jobs so you're actually if the idea of a

978
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,960
tariff to protect American jobs but the

979
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,000
Tariff doesn't make it more expensive

980
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,720
the inputs that Americans need for their

981
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,040
jobs you actually hurt American

982
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,440
jobs okay so that's the second argument

983
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,440
the third argument is you need

984
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,839
coordination which is the US isn't the

985
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,640
only party that trades with

986
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,599
China the US is not the only party that

987
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,920
that that trades with China so suppose

988
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,720
you're trading your Pokemon with your

989
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,599
friends but your friend has a bunch of

990
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,520
people he's trading with and you decide

991
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,359
because your friend pissed you off you

992
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,079
won't trade with him he'll just trade

993
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,720
the cards to someone else now he might

994
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,599
not get quite as good a deal but he's

995
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,960
not as he not suddenly like he can't

996
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,359
trade his cards he just got to trade in

997
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,000
with someone else and basically uh

998
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,720
that's what happened is China just

999
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,839
started selling their goods to other

1000
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,280
countries so basically the reason that

1001
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,520
this was a bad way to approach our

1002
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,760
problems with

1003
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,920
China was it's bad for American

1004
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,200
consumers it might be bad for American

1005
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,680
Producers it doesn't do much if you

1006
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,480
don't coordinate internationally that's

1007
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,920
why most economists who are smart in

1008
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,720
this area said we should have serious

1009
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,960
trade re repercussions against China we

1010
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,079
should think about barriers trade with

1011
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,800
China but has to be done an

1012
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:13,200
internationally coordinated way and that

1013
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,920
wasn't what was

1014
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,920
done so basically you end up with fairly

1015
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,800
ineffective trade barriers on

1016
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,560
China okay now the latest attempt of

1017
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,599
this to use foreign po to use trade as a

1018
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,760
foreign policy tool was s on Russian

1019
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,319
oil not allowing people to buy Russian

1020
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,079
oil because the Ukraine war once again

1021
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:37,760
this didn't work so well because other

1022
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,160
countries were still Rising other

1023
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,319
countries were still

1024
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:46,920
buying okay and that's a and b this

1025
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,079
became incredibly painful for Europe

1026
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,079
because Europe depended so much on

1027
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,359
Russia for their fuel and the question

1028
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,480
is can Europe really are you going to

1029
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,040
break apart the European Coalition

1030
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,720
because they don't want to keep placing

1031
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,000
such high high prices for fuel

1032
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:04,800
okay on the other hand if you if you um

1033
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,640
if you uh tell countries they can't

1034
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,480
export goods to Russia that might be

1035
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,640
more effective because that makes life

1036
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,800
the life miserable in Russia maybe

1037
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,760
they'll throw off their leader they

1038
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,119
probably won't but that would be another

1039
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
way you could approach it so these are

1040
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,920
really interesting and difficult issues

1041
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,880
to think through and exciting think

1042
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,440
about how we can once again use the

1043
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,720
tools of microeconomics to come at this

1044
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,720
questions about

1045
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,720
that yeah

1046
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,680
that it's it's it's a great point so the

1047
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,680
trade War you're asking about this

1048
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,800
argument the trade War argument is less

1049
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,200
powerful if you're talking about country

1050
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,720
we don't really sell them much now North

1051
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,119
Korea is different we have that's

1052
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,839
sanctions that's just we won't deal with

1053
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,119
them but if you think about a small

1054
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,839
country if you think about suddenly we

1055
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,160
got mad think about Columbia they don't

1056
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,000
buy that many computers okay so you

1057
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,160
might say this argument is not super

1058
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,720
relevant uh if the country is small okay

1059
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,280
I agree with

1060
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,400
that okay let me talk about one other

1061
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
since I haven't been controversial

1062
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,640
enough today let's talk about one other

1063
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,640
non-controversial topic which is

1064
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,640
immigration

1065
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,200
immigration the same set of principles

1066
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,839
that applies to free flow of goods

1067
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,800
applies to the free flow of

1068
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,880
workers so look at figure

1069
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,400
198 think about producing fruit in the

1070
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,559
US okay originally under art tarkey we

1071
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,880
have L1 workers

1072
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,640
producing fruit at a wage of

1073
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,040
W1 now if we allow

1074
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,520
immigration that shifts out the supply

1075
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,240
of workers shifts

1076
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,319
out now we have S2

1077
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:17,240
workers at a lower

1078
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,599
wage well what does that do to the

1079
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,440
market for fruit let's go to figure 199

1080
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,040
so this is I'm sorry 8 is not the market

1081
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,440
for fruit this is this a bit unclear 98

1082
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,000
is the labor market for people producing

1083
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,119
fruit very clear 198 is the labor market

1084
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
diagram in Fruit production 199 is the

1085
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,119
fruit

1086
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,800
market well what's happened I just

1087
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:41,559
showed you in

1088
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:45,440
198 that the wage went down if the wage

1089
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:49,880
goes down marginal cost goes down so

1090
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,520
supply curve shifts out from S1 to S2

1091
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,280
what does that do it allows more fruit

1092
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,880
at a lower

1093
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,000
price so this is why economists

1094
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,040
generally favor relatively free

1095
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,119
immigration because by having immigrants

1096
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,520
come in and do jobs we allow Goods to

1097
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,359
produce more cheaply and it creates

1098
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,680
consumer

1099
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:17,119
surplus okay on the other hand figure

1100
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,000
198 is why many people in America don't

1101
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,119
like

1102
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,440
immigration which is the wage

1103
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,839
Falls so it's once again a standard

1104
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,440
tradeoff much like trade by allowing

1105
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,280
immigrants in we allow more consumer

1106
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,359
surplus through cheaper

1107
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,839
fruit but we lower the wage that workers

1108
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,920
get in the fruit producing sector and I

1109
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,280
don't need to go through the graphs to

1110
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,720
show you that the former dominates the

1111
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,960
latter overall we're better off with

1112
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,880
immigration now we're only overall

1113
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,440
better off immigration however however

1114
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,839
if we can make some mechanism to

1115
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,800
compensate the losers if we for example

1116
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,119
said well look we're now going to tax

1117
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,400
fruit fruit's cheaper we're going to tax

1118
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,880
fruit and give the money to the former

1119
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,559
fruit producers then that would work but

1120
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,599
we're not doing it not do anything to

1121
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,400
help those frood

1122
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:04,280
producers okay so the question is how

1123
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,480
big a problem is this and the there's

1124
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,160
actually a number of really good

1125
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,640
studies of how does

1126
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,400
immigration affect domestic wages and

1127
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,680
prices what they find is more

1128
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,920
immigration does lower

1129
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,640
prices what they also find is more

1130
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:24,000
immigration doesn't much lower has if

1131
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:28,599
anything a negligible effect on the

1132
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,280
wages of us born workers

1133
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,680
relatively small

1134
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,040
effect which could be for two reasons

1135
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,720
one reason could be because of

1136
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,720
elasticities the other could be because

1137
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,760
they're in sectors that people don't

1138
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,720
want to work in people don't want to

1139
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,920
pick fruit they don't want to work at

1140
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,559
the gas station of

1141
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,040
7-Eleven okay so basically this is one

1142
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,800
reason I'm not alling wages is because

1143
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,920
these are jobs people didn't

1144
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:55,200
want okay but here's the fascinating

1145
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,640
Fact one group does get hurt by more

1146
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,000
immigration the previous

1147
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,920
immigrants so people who actually hurt

1148
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
by this the group for which wages fall

1149
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,440
are the last generation of immigrants

1150
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,800
because they are working in those

1151
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,440
sectors this leads to the fascinating

1152
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,559
Paradox at the heart of a concern in

1153
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,640
politics that many have on the left

1154
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:20,359
which is GE why are immigrants turning

1155
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,119
against the Democratic party turning

1156
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:24,319
against free trade turning its free

1157
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,680
immigration why don't immigrants the

1158
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,000
Democrats are clearly the party of much

1159
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,920
freeer immigration than the republ

1160
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,040
Republicans yet they're losing immigrant

1161
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,000
votes well actually it kind of makes

1162
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,520
sense if you think about it because the

1163
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,280
future immigrants are going to hurt the

1164
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,440
wage of the existing immigrants so it

1165
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,599
kind of makes sense it's sort of a pull

1166
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,960
the ladder up behind me argument once

1167
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,160
I'm in and I want more people in once

1168
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,200
I've got my job in the fruit picking

1169
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,720
sector I don't want more people to come

1170
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,040
in I'll lower my wage so it's Pro it's

1171
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,400
perhaps not irrational for some

1172
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,559
immigrants to oppose additional

1173
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,119
immigration because they're the one not

1174
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:57,640
not us-born people but immigrants

1175
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,559
previous immigrants the ones whose wages

1176
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,200
will

1177
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,480
suffer so once again a subtle but

1178
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,720
important arguments we think about

1179
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,440
obviously with immigration there's a ton

1180
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,280
of other issues we won't get into here

1181
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,520
that aren't about economics I'm not

1182
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,440
claiming this is the the end point of

1183
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,480
immigration policy discussion but it's

1184
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,839
important to remember that the tools I

1185
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,720
taught you about trade can be applied

1186
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:21,079
broadly including the immigration debate

1187
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,079
okay let's stop there
