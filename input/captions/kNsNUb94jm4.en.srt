1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,959
yeah thanks so much for having me today

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,160
and and after the the prior I think

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,600
really excellent talk for what it's

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,440
worth I think I rarely see that topic of

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,000
um kind of AI and data center um energy

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,599
usage and climate impacts covered with

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,400
so much Nuance so I'm really

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,960
appreciative of the the previous speaker

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,920
talk um and so during my time I want to

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
to spend some time maybe also zooming

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,320
out and talking about kind of

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
holistically how is it that machine

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
learning and climate change interact and

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,400
of course I probably don't even have to

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,920
motivate this right but you know climate

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,120
change one of the biggest issues of our

17
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,200
time impacts are being felt globally um

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,040
this involves a need for both you know

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,360
Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,520
2050 across many different sectors as

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,640
well as large- scale adaptation efforts

22
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,960
uh that are inherently local at a global

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,760
scale and so of course it becomes very

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
natural to ask the question of what is

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,320
the role of machine learning in this

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,600
overall

27
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,960
picture and machine learning and climate

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,039
change have actually a relatively

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,920
multifaceted relationship covering both

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,960
ways that machine learning is being used

31
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,080
to enable climate action but also as we

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,600
heard about just now the impacts from

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,680
machine learning computation and

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,159
Hardware while this is often posed as

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,640
the whole picture in general you know

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
machine learning is good because we can

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,799
use it for good things and machine

38
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
learning is bad because it has direct

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,560
impacts this isn't the whole story

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,400
machine learning is also used in ways

41
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,920
that are actively negative for climate

42
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,000
both for applications that increase

43
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,119
greenhouse gas emissions and in in ways

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,360
that kind of induce broader system level

45
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,119
changes and um that actually have huge

46
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,159
implications for our ability to address

47
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,200
climate change so I want to spend some

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,560
time digging into each of these

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,719
aspects so first machine learning for

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,079
climate

51
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,079
action so um several years ago a group

52
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,560
of collaborators and I um kind of

53
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,159
surveyed this space and um tried to

54
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,280
identify you know where is it that

55
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,560
machine learning can actually help

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,399
address climate change across a variety

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,280
of different sectors across electricity

58
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,680
systems buildings um industry climate

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,079
science and so forth and for those who

60
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,399
are interested I'd encourage you to

61
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,959
check out kind of the full report but I

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,280
want to spend some time highlighting

63
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,959
some common themes that came up across

64
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,480
these different applications as as we

65
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,400
looked

66
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,480
through so one kind of big category of

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,360
applications is distilling raw data into

68
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,280
actionable insights there are many

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,239
scenarios where we just wish we had a

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,040
more targeted picture of greenhouse gas

71
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,519
Emissions on the ground or where

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
deforestation is happening or the Energy

73
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,200
Efficiency characteristics of buildings

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
at a city scale but where we for

75
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
whatever reason have not had the

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,440
opportunity or ability to do kind of on

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,080
the ground data collection and surveying

78
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,519
at the scale we would like in those

79
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,640
situations uh sources like satellite

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
imagery and aerial imagery can provide a

81
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,480
way to get a proxy for that information

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,159
by basically taking satellite imagery

83
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,040
labeling it on a selection of instances

84
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,840
learning what it means for something to

85
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,800
look like deforestation or something to

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,560
to look like a kind of power plant that

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,239
is on and then actually extrapolate that

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,120
to to kind of around the world and so

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,120
the um image on the slide is from a

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,400
coalition of nonprofits called climate

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Trace which is specifically trying to

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,920
compile independent um independent

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,840
greenhouse gas emissions inventories um

94
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,680
for as kind of input to the UN climate

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,360
change um negotiations by basically

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,319
taking a combination of satellite

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
imagery and on the ground data in order

98
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,959
to assess in different sectors what are

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,599
the emissions at the entity level at

100
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,760
from the power sector from from the

101
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,080
industrial sector and so

102
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,319
forth another theme that often comes up

103
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,760
is improving predictions so doing

104
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,799
something like using information like

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,799
historical data about solar power

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,280
production and using that to forecast

107
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,560
what solar power production will look

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,159
like in the near future and this kind of

109
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,040
thing can actually help us to better

110
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,879
manage for example power grids with

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
large amounts of Renewables by allowing

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,319
us to maintain balance between the

113
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
amount of Supply we have and the amount

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,079
of demand and the kind of powerful thing

115
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,400
that machine learning techniques can do

116
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,560
here is that they can take in different

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,360
modalities or different types of data

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,000
and learn relationships between them in

119
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,120
a way that's very powerful so the image

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,359
on the slide is from a nonprofit called

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
um open climate fix which is working

122
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,880
with the UK power system operator to

123
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,759
improve their forecasts of um energy

124
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,360
supply and demand and what they're doing

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,199
is combining information like

126
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,840
um historical um weather data historical

127
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,759
power production with the outputs of

128
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,520
physical kind of weather models that are

129
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,840
providing um information about what the

130
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,680
weather will look like with things like

131
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,440
information about the cloud moving

132
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,360
movement overhead that might be provided

133
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,919
by satellite and aerial imagery and

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,560
combining that together and learning

135
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,680
relationships between it in a really

136
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,440
powerful way that allows more accurate

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,759
and targeted forecasts of solar power

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
production so while the last two themes

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,199
have to in some sense do with kind of

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,280
providing information to a decision

141
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,240
maker there are many places where

142
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,680
machine learning itself can can play a

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,360
role in automated decision making so for

144
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,759
example when we think about the heating

145
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,320
and cooling systems in our buildings

146
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,360
there are many opportunities to make

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,360
these more efficient by taking into

148
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,199
account things like what the weather is

149
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,800
outside is the building occupied what is

150
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,520
the actual temperature of the building

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,319
right now what are the physical

152
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,800
characteristics of the building and

153
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,840
machine learning has been used to

154
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,919
basically take in all of this real-time

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,759
information and come up with better

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,840
strategies to actually optimize heating

157
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,039
and cooling systems in a way that kind

158
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,199
of keeps the thermal comfort of a

159
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,880
building intact while also reducing

160
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,840
energy usage and this kind of thing

161
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,960
happens not just in kind of heating and

162
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,520
cooling systems in buildings but also in

163
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,400
kind of refrigeration systems in data

164
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,160
centers and Industrial facilities and so

165
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,759
forth a kind of similar but maybe much

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,759
less um flashy set of applications is in

167
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,080
predictive maintenance so basically

168
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,599
trying to identify when a system has

169
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,599
broken or is about to break in order to

170
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,080
kind of preemptively fix it and avoid

171
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,000
any inefficiencies that result from that

172
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,080
so the German rail operator do Shaban

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
for example uses machine learning to

174
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,400
identify faults in the switching

175
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,360
infrastructure in the railways in order

176
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,120
to then actually help fix those

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
preemptively and allow the cranes to

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,880
keep running on time now I know a lot of

179
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,240
Germans will complain that Doan does not

180
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,560
run on time but it would maybe be even

181
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,039
worse without AI um another kind of

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
similar um area is the detection of

183
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,120
methane Le leaks in natural gas

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,960
infrastructure where as natural gas is

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,319
transported from where it's extracted to

186
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,560
where it's used um it may leak from the

187
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,599
pipelines or the compressor stations and

188
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,520
so machine learning has been used to

189
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,680
both using aerial and satellite imagery

190
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,280
but also in some cases even sensors

191
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,800
outfitted along that equipment identify

192
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,240
where there may be anomalies or

193
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,039
something that is about to go wrong in

194
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,039
order to fix

195
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,759
that in addition to helping with

196
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,360
existing operational systems machine

197
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,160
learning can also play a role in

198
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,160
actually helping with the kind of you

199
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,840
know science and engineering processes

200
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,319
that are helping us figuring out how to

201
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,759
kind of create new technologies or

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,360
transition our system in the future so

203
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,000
for instance machine learning is very

204
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,639
commonly used to accelerate the practice

205
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,800
of a scientific discovery um and I know

206
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,960
people have different and nuanced

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,879
opinions about it but actually there was

208
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,400
a Nobel given for for this General enal

209
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,360
idea where you are um analyzing the

210
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,319
outcomes of past experiments where

211
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,599
you're trying to for example synthesize

212
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,120
a molecule or a battery or an electr

213
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,639
fuel or a CO2 sorbent and you're using

214
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,319
that uh the recommendations that are

215
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,159
that are gained by analyzing those past

216
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,759
experiments using machine learning in

217
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,879
order to guide your process of

218
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,720
experimentation going forward and that

219
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,759
can help cut down on the number of

220
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
design Cycles or experiments or kind of

221
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,159
like physical synthesis runs that you

222
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,680
actually to do before you maybe come up

223
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,960
with an impactful material or impactful

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
technology machine learning is also used

225
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,400
in the science and engineering realm to

226
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,599
help approximate time intensive

227
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,440
simulations so the image on the slide is

228
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,560
from an early paper in 2019 that was

229
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,120
proposing the idea of using machine

230
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,280
learning to approximate the physics of

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,159
clouds within a climate model each

232
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,080
individual cloud in a climate model has

233
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,000
really complex physical interactions

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
going on where somehow clouds have a

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,320
cooling effect and some clouds have a

236
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,240
warming effect and you can imagine

237
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,680
putting a bunch of really complicated

238
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,120
Cloud models in an already really large

239
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,719
climate model blows up the computational

240
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,399
intensity of that model and makes it

241
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,279
hard to run and so there have been a

242
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,160
number of Works proposed that say can we

243
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,959
approximate things like individual

244
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,839
clouds or individual parts of these

245
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,519
models and stick that back into the

246
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,920
original model in a way that allows us

247
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,000
to run the overall model faster um and

248
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,959
at higher resolution which means for

249
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,959
example like

250
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,839
in in the past we might have only had a

251
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,519
climate Insight where we had one data

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,120
point for the entirety of Massachusetts

253
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,519
maybe we now actually understand what

254
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,560
might happen in Cambridge and as a

255
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,519
result what can we do about that um and

256
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,519
since then um there have been kind of a

257
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,279
number of advancements where not even

258
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,040
part of the model but maybe where entire

259
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,240
weather models or entire climate models

260
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,760
or entire subsystems are being well

261
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,560
approximated using Ai and machine

262
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,200
learning as so this is a really kind of

263
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,440
active area of research and engagement

264
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,440
at the moment

265
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,000
so last but not least um we often think

266
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,399
of you know machine learning as being

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,560
something that takes data in and that's

268
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,440
true but interestingly machine learning

269
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,920
can be used to actually help manage data

270
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,240
um in ways that are helpful in climate

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,760
change related workflows so for instance

272
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
not pictured on the slide is um there's

273
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,440
a Cooperative called the CL Catalyst

274
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,399
Cooperative which is actually using

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,040
machine learning to help match and merge

276
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,440
different energy data sets that are

277
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,920
published by the US government where

278
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,000
those different energy data sets are

279
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,040
describing the same power generators but

280
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,800
the kind of way in which those power

281
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,440
generators are labeled or referenced is

282
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,519
not consistent um between these these

283
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
sources and so they use machine learning

284
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,760
to identify when is it that two

285
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
different records in these two different

286
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,399
data sources are actually referring to

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,120
the same entity to the same power

288
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,640
generator in order to automate that

289
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,720
merging process um and the image on the

290
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,839
slide is um from a group at the

291
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,320
University of Washington which is using

292
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,160
machine learning for scenario generation

293
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,560
so thinking about in the

294
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,839
future when you when you run a model to

295
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,639
for example plan your future power grid

296
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,399
you do this based on having a bunch of

297
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,800
different scenarios of for example how

298
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,160
much wind power do you think will be

299
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,360
produced in the future and so what they

300
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,440
did is they used machine learning to

301
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
analyze historical wind power data learn

302
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,000
kind of like a probability distribution

303
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
over it understand how do we think that

304
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,320
probability distribution will shift in

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
the future because some places may be

306
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
windier some won't so they actively

307
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,279
tweaked those parameters

308
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,959
and then they use that to sample from

309
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,240
that new distribution in order to get

310
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,880
kind of future win

311
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,480
scenarios so there's a lot of really I

312
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,680
think cool and impactful stuff going on

313
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,160
in the realm of of machine learning for

314
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,000
climate action and one thing I want to

315
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,880
highlight is across these different

316
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,959
applications I've talked about the

317
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,760
diversity of approaches and techniques

318
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,880
that that are here many of these

319
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,480
applications for example are not text

320
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,440
many of these are not using large

321
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,040
language models or generative models

322
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,959
while these models can be impactful

323
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,560
they're only one piece of the the puzzle

324
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,279
and in fact you know the the kinds of

325
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,760
settings we think about when we think

326
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,079
about climate action are really diverse

327
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,720
and those require diverse approaches

328
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,320
today when we think about the dominant

329
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,639
Paradigm of machine learning we're often

330
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,320
thinking Big Data big compute you only

331
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,639
need data you can throw out any other

332
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,279
knowledge or information you had and the

333
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,000
only metric we care about with respect

334
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,240
to Performance is the average accuracy

335
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,760
of the model in reality in different

336
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,920
climate related settings we might have

337
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,200
less data or you may have a lot of data

338
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,959
but it might be hard to move to where

339
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,639
you actually need to do the computation

340
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,959
this is true in for example power grids

341
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,199
you might have less compute due to kind

342
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,000
of um organizational constraints for

343
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,199
example you might be needing to do

344
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,600
Computing on an edge device or a sensor

345
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:20,920
you might want to reduce energy and

346
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,880
Emissions for obvious reasons you might

347
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,480
have useful knowledge already that you

348
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,199
don't need to relearn from data and my

349
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
own work is in the electric power sector

350
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:30,120
where we know something about the

351
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,040
physics of the power grid and we can

352
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,519
combine that information with data

353
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,839
rather than assuming that information

354
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,160
doesn't exist and depending on the

355
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,600
setting you're looking at there's a

356
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,519
diverse set of metrics we should care

357
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,959
about maybe in some cases you care more

358
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,839
about protecting a particular group that

359
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,800
for example is is unusually harmed or is

360
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,120
underrepresented than caring about kind

361
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,959
of group average accuracy you might care

362
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,240
about metrics like safety or robustness

363
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,079
if you don't want to black out your

364
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,519
power grid interpretability if you're in

365
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,240
a decision critical setting so there are

366
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,680
lots of different metrics and lots of

367
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,760
different kind of there's there's a huge

368
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,040
heterogeneity of assumptions in the

369
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,720
settings we're looking at um and that

370
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,560
means that there are lots of different

371
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,600
opportunities for Innovation across a

372
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,720
lot of different settings including kind

373
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,560
of physics informed and robust ml

374
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,399
interpretable machine learning energy

375
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,160
efficient machine learning we heard from

376
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,959
the last speaker about autom automl so

377
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,519
kind of Designing models automatically

378
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,760
that are less energy consumptive and

379
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,600
will produce uh better results for your

380
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,519
area um and I think it's important that

381
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,279
as we hear claims about hey we should

382
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
continue investing in kind of the

383
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
predominant Paradigm of generative AI

384
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,000
because generative AI is going to be

385
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
good for the climate I'm not writing off

386
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,639
that generative AI will be helpful for

387
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,760
the climate but when we talk about Ai

388
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,839
and climate there's a much wider variety

389
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,160
of techniques at play and so we should

390
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,880
moderate our our kind of enthusiasm and

391
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,160
understand accordingly where Investments

392
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,959
should go in order to make sure that

393
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,600
we're actually fostering a really

394
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,360
diverse ecosystem of AI techniques that

395
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,199
can really meet this diverse set of

396
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,880
challenges rather than kind of

397
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,399
conflating one particular set of AI

398
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,480
techniques and one particular AI

399
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,480
Paradigm with the broader AI e system

400
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,320
here so my own work just really briefly

401
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
looks at kind of one of these specific

402
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,800
paradigms of physics informed machine

403
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,279
learning so my group's work thinks we we

404
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,440
look a lot at you know how do you

405
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,920
actually optimize and schedule power on

406
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
power grids in a way that allows us to

407
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,600
integrate Renewables and this is a tough

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,639
challenge because power grids have lots

409
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,440
of physics and hard constraints and

410
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,480
decision-making procedures going on all

411
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,120
the time where if you don't satisfy

412
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,399
those you're going to black out your

413
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,399
grid traditional optimization and

414
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,399
control techniques um end up what they

415
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,480
do is they write down the physics of the

416
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,839
power grid explicitly um in a way that

417
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,120
allows you to make sure you're doing

418
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,639
something that's reasonable for your

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
grid but is really slow to solve for

420
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,639
which means that we are needing to

421
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,480
manage grids at greater speed and at

422
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,240
greater scale that doesn't work but

423
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,639
naive machine learning techniques even

424
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,519
though they're fast and

425
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,240
scalable are naive about the physics of

426
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,680
the power grid and so they're not able

427
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,519
to deal with that and so my group's work

428
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,680
looks at how can we actually merge these

429
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,519
two paradigms how can we combine

430
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,000
physical knowledge that we already have

431
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,680
about power grids with data driven

432
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,839
techniques and the kind of for for those

433
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,800
who want to nerd out about this later

434
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,560
the key idea is that in the context of

435
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,000
machine learning models and specifically

436
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,000
neural networks you can think about

437
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,240
neural networks neural network is a

438
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,959
bunch bunch of functions composed

439
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,680
together and so we basically find ways

440
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,680
to take the kinds of you know physical

441
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,720
equations and Engineering constraints

442
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,120
that we care about in power grids and

443
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,480
write them down as the kinds of

444
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,399
functions or relations that we can

445
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,720
actually stick into a neural network and

446
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,399
that way you get neural networks that

447
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,079
enforce physical constraints you care

448
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,079
about on the power grid as well as um

449
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,480
being able to learn from from data and

450
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,600
use that for various things like

451
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,480
decision cognizant forecasting for

452
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,480
approximating power grid optimization

453
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,279
models and for doing distributed control

454
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,279
via reinforcement

455
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,639
learning all right so I spent most of my

456
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,920
time uh talking about this bucket of you

457
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,399
know places that I think machine

458
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,959
learning can be useful for climate

459
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,959
action and again I think there are many

460
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,519
places it can be useful um and that all

461
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,680
of these applications in order to do

462
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,240
them well you have to really contend

463
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,639
with what the needs are on the ground

464
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,319
and work with a diverse set of

465
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,199
stakeholders in order to make sure that

466
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,000
you're actually capturing and satisfying

467
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,160
those

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,040
needs but I do want to spend a little

469
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,440
time talking about again this bigger

470
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,880
picture of you know where is it that

471
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,199
machine learning interacts with climate

472
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,399
change as we heard from the last speaker

473
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,920
machine learning has various impacts via

474
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,160
its computation and hardware and I'm

475
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,319
going going to go through this part

476
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
quickly because I think there's some

477
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,079
some overlap in what was discussed but

478
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,160
as we heard from the last speaker

479
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,920
machine learning has impacts directly

480
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,600
both through its operational impacts

481
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,720
when you're actually running a machine

482
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,000
learning model what are the for example

483
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,480
energy and water consumed when you do

484
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,360
that and also embodied impacts and

485
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,079
materials impacts that come from the

486
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,799
hardware itself so what were the carbon

487
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,919
emissions associated with producing and

488
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,799
transporting that Hardware what happens

489
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,600
when you dispose the hardware and so

490
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,919
forth and as mentioned by the previous

491
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,679
speaker in something like 2020 data

492
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,439
centers and the uh information and

493
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,919
communication technology Center as a

494
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,880
whole made up between 1 to 2% of global

495
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,919
greenhouse gas emissions of which AI was

496
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,320
some unknown fraction that number has

497
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,240
changed but we don't know what it's

498
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,480
changed to because there often is a bit

499
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,880
of a lag in this data coming out as well

500
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,559
as honestly lack of transparency among

501
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,400
providers of um of compute into in order

502
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,120
to to compute these but it has

503
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,240
undoubtedly gone

504
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,240
up and from the AI side um where these

505
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,360
uh from the AI and machine learning side

506
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,799
where the energy use specifically comes

507
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,200
from is through a mix of the process

508
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,080
that is C that is um uh developing the

509
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,559
machine learning model then training the

510
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,679
machine learning model so kind of

511
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,559
running it on a bunch of data to get get

512
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,640
some good parameters and then using the

513
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:20,080
the machine learning model the inference

514
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,799
space and what we're seeing is

515
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,039
that the electricity of demand here is

516
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,159
growing so this is a um uh kind of

517
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,200
projection from the um iea Global

518
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,400
electricity demand from data centers Ai

519
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,320
and cryptocurrencies and we've seen an

520
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,200
approximately two times increase in the

521
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,039
electricity demand from this group of

522
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,240
Technologies um from 2021 to

523
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,880
2026 again there's a lot of uncertainty

524
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,840
in these numbers but I think it's useful

525
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
to put this in this in the historical

526
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,320
context where we see again this 2x

527
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,240
increase between 2019 and

528
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,320
2026 and if you look back the similar

529
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,840
number of years say from 2010 to 2018 we

530
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,039
saw only a 6% increase in electricity

531
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,559
demand despite an almost six times

532
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,840
increase in compute instances so we were

533
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,000
using a lot more compute it's just that

534
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,080
Hardware was getting much more efficient

535
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
in a way that was compensating for that

536
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,880
and that trend has been true for a while

537
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,559
the fact that that Trend doesn't seem to

538
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,080
be true right now that objectively raw

539
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:26,240
electricity demand is rising means we

540
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,919
are in a new realm at the moment and so

541
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,240
it is something that to pay attention to

542
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,480
and make sure that we're we're actively

543
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,960
doing something

544
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,840
about and there's some nuances here in

545
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,440
terms of the kind of Dynamics and trends

546
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:43,200
of of what's going on so um for example

547
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,280
this is a um graph um that comes from an

548
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,960
examination of the emissions of

549
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,640
different machine learning models at

550
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,480
Facebook and what they eval evaluated is

551
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,679
they had kind of old recommender system

552
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,240
models that were being used across their

553
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,480
workf flows and then they have new kind

554
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,320
of large language models type things

555
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,720
that are being used for similar

556
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,919
purposes and what they found is that for

557
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,400
their prior recommender models the total

558
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:16,080
carbon footprint was coming about 50/50

559
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,280
from training the model versus using the

560
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
model so training a model is a much more

561
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,640
carbon intensive thing to do but you

562
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,200
tend to do it fewer times using a model

563
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,919
when after it's already trained is a

564
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
less carbon intensive thing to do per

565
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,400
use but since you're doing it many times

566
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,760
that kind of total kind of carbon in

567
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,919
carbon emissions might increase and so

568
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,640
for older recommender system um

569
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,799
recommender systems it was a kind of

570
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,640
about 5050 that things were coming from

571
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,840
for their large language models what

572
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,200
they found is that inference dominated

573
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,720
training so the kind of number of uses

574
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,679
that were happening and the specific

575
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,880
nuances of what even one use means means

576
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,720
that the use phase was more carbon

577
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,720
intensive in total than the um the the

578
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,080
training

579
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,480
phase and there have also been studies

580
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,080
that have shown that for example as we

581
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,080
move and have this trend in society

582
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,960
where specific tasks we used to use task

583
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,360
specific models for them and now we're

584
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,000
using more general purpose models that

585
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,480
each inference each use of a model is

586
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
actually more intensive than it was

587
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,640
before because we're choosing to use

588
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
bigger models even though we didn't do

589
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,000
that before and so per inference

590
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,840
multi-purpose models can be orders of

591
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
magnitude more specific than task

592
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,679
specific model so even potentially by

593
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
choosing quote unquote the wrong models

594
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,640
or different models we're blowing up the

595
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,600
the the um kind of total uses usage

596
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,080
associated with our old use cases as

597
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,679
well so understanding these Dynamics and

598
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,360
Trends is super important to

599
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,240
understanding what we actually do about

600
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,320
this and so this is where really

601
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,120
increased transparency and data

602
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,200
collection among those who are running

603
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,279
and running these models and who are

604
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,799
providing the computational

605
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,400
infrastructure becomes exceedingly

606
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,360
important

607
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,480
an argument that's often used is okay so

608
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,559
you've talked a lot about energy and you

609
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,960
talked a lot about carbon emissions why

610
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,320
can't you just green the power grid and

611
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,480
hook Renewables up or move your

612
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,080
workloads to times when when carbon is

613
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,240
Le when the carbon intensity is less

614
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,000
this is important but insufficient so we

615
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,200
uh kind of as part of our Global

616
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,880
strategies to decarbonize the energy

617
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,640
sector we need to become more efficient

618
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,200
and reduce energy usage not allow it to

619
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,840
grow and this is something the previous

620
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,960
speaker mentioned as well so this

621
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,400
applies to kind of AI induced energy

622
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,080
workloads as well in addition uh kind of

623
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,000
AI workloads have water related impacts

624
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,200
particularly many data centers are in

625
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,640
water stressed regions and of course as

626
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,679
we've talked about there are minerals

627
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,520
and resources that are necessary to

628
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,240
build computational infrastructure um

629
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,360
that doesn't just go away when we put

630
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,240
renewals on the grid so Greening the

631
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,799
grid is really important but there are

632
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,600
many other things we need to do which

633
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,480
include uh making things more efficient

634
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,559
and reducing waste sort of assessing

635
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,120
when particular runs or applications are

636
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,120
actually not

637
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,960
necessary so in my last few minutes um I

638
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,760
want to talk about these last two

639
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,720
buckets of kind of ways that machine

640
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,480
learning is used that I think have

641
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,559
either kind of negative or uncertain

642
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,559
implications for climate so very kind of

643
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:28,600
um uh prominently machine learning is

644
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,240
often used to accelerate emissions int

645
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,240
of Industries like the oil and gas

646
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,600
industry so for instance a report that

647
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,559
came out in 2020 noted that Ai and

648
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,880
machine learning boosted oil and gas

649
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,000
production levels in some cases by as

650
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,440
much as 5% and generated or was

651
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
projected to generate you know something

652
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,240
like $400 billion dollar in value for

653
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,840
the oil and gas sector in a way that

654
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,000
kind of entrenches the role of that

655
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,360
sector um and I will say this is still

656
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,360
kind of ongoing with a number of leading

657
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,120
tech companies still actively marketing

658
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,400
to oil and gas companies and building

659
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,000
active businesses around the practice of

660
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,320
accelerating oil and gas exploration and

661
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,039
extraction but it's not just oil and gas

662
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,279
there's for example uses of machine

663
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,400
learning and AI to do things like um

664
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,960
optimize the internet of cows um to to

665
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,440
kind of manage livestock at scale um and

666
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,120
these are multi-objective problems on

667
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,919
the one hand making the lives of certain

668
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,159
Farmers much easier helping increase

669
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,799
profits and productivity for Farmers but

670
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,520
also entrenching the role of bad and

671
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,480
agriculture in a way that might be

672
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,080
carbon intensive

673
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,760
and while these applications are easy to

674
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,399
point to and say you're actively doing

675
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
something that's red that's increasing

676
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:37,679
greenhouse gas emissions there are lots

677
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,919
of more subtle but transformative

678
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,440
effects that machine learning has that

679
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,760
we should really be paying attention to

680
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,919
in the context of climate for instance

681
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,200
as we increasingly think about machine

682
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,520
learning as a driver of autonomous

683
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,960
vehicles we need to think about the

684
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,760
effects that autonomous vehicles

685
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,279
potentially have on the transportation

686
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,559
sector where an individual autonomous

687
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,520
vehicle um might be kind of more

688
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,279
efficient in in terms of uh kind of um

689
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,279
energy per mile traveled because of

690
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,399
efficient driving strategies that might

691
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,360
cause a rebound where people also drive

692
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:12,559
more and also have a lock in effect

693
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,000
where we entrench the role of kind of

694
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,240
privatized and and privatized

695
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,559
Transportation rather than necessarily

696
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,720
thinking about how do we better

697
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,640
facilitate multimodal Transportation

698
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,039
this isn't a given but we can actively

699
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
make choices where we're developing

700
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,640
these Technologies to try to facilitate

701
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,679
transformation of the transportation

702
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,760
sector rather than lock in and is is

703
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,120
something we need to be really cognizant

704
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,440
of machine learning also increases

705
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,640
societal consumption via things like

706
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,159
personalized advertising and On Demand

707
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,320
delivery in ways that don't always

708
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,000
increase happiness but do increase

709
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,120
emissions and consumption and in ways

710
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,799
that we really should be thinking about

711
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,600
machine learning changes how we consume

712
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,080
information online through things like

713
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,440
content personalization and

714
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,279
amplification of polarized views machine

715
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,720
learning can also be a kind of asset in

716
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,039
terms of serving more Target information

717
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,200
or finding misinformation but again we

718
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,559
have to choose to leverage it in that

719
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,960
way um rather than for example

720
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,559
optimizing for clicks on social media

721
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,039
using machine

722
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,640
learning and machine learning techniques

723
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,000
are often at this point largely

724
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,120
developed and vended by a small set of

725
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,880
players in a small set of countries and

726
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,600
contexts and they're evented to a wide

727
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,880
variety of players across the world for

728
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,159
example many kind of consultancies and

729
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,799
Tech compan companies that are the kind

730
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,159
of main Solutions provider to to small

731
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,000
cities and Smart City initiatives and

732
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,320
that can cause lock in for those Smart

733
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,799
City initiatives to a particular

734
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,960
Solutions provider it can mean that the

735
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,480
agenda of that particular Smart City

736
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,120
initiative is driven by the solutions

737
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,799
provider so we really need to be

738
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,880
cognizant of the ways that our

739
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,760
trajectory of AI and machine learning

740
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,640
are really causing different people in

741
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,240
society to have more or less um Power in

742
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,640
the conversation and what we need to do

743
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,919
to actually shift that agency

744
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,960
so with that you know what can we do

745
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,240
there's a lot we can do in terms of you

746
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,039
know making sure that we're investing in

747
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
you know heterogeneous paradigms of AI

748
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,120
and machine learning working on good

749
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,080
applications adopting individual and

750
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,320
organizational practices like organ

751
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,559
organizational carbon pricing covering

752
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,039
Scopes one two and three um and um kind

753
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,760
of making sure that we're appropriately

754
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:26,080
communicating about the benefits and

755
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,279
risks of AI in an appropriately kind of

756
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,559
nuanced and grounded way rather than

757
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:33,399
necessarily hyping it um and there are

758
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,159
many levers that the climate and policy

759
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:38,039
Community can take as well to um both

760
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,320
Foster the use of AI for climate action

761
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:42,360
in a more Equitable and democratized Way

762
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,880
by kind of providing better you know

763
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,679
data and digital infrastructure

764
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,039
targeting research funding and creating

765
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,640
Pathways to deployment as well as to

766
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,519
kind of mitigate the negative

767
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,799
implications of AI and machine learning

768
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,880
for climate for instance by building

769
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:59,000
kind of climate cognizant reporting and

770
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,200
assessment into AI Strate IES to make

771
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,240
sure that as we think about how are we

772
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
moving AI forward that we're actively

773
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,640
accounting for both ai's direct impacts

774
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,559
and the implications of the different

775
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,399
applications we're using it for both

776
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,640
kind of AI for good applications and the

777
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,480
business as

778
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,279
usual so with that I would definitely

779
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,760
encourage you to if you're interested in

780
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,440
these topics um kind of plug into the

781
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,000
climate change AI Community climate

782
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,000
change AI is a nonprofit I co-founded

783
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,279
and we have you know a lot of people

784
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,559
actively engaging in these kinds of

785
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,559
discussions and trying to figure out how

786
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,320
to push forward ai ai in a way that's

787
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,960
aligned with climate action so I'd

788
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,320
encourage you to check out the

789
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,519
educational resources funding programs

790
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,720
conferences and so forth um and with

791
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,279
that I know I am over time and so uh

792
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,399
thanks so much and um if we have time

793
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,000
for questions look forward to it
