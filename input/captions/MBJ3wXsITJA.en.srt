00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,960
Please welcome Kronos AI enable precise

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,040
3D geocation leveraging virtually all

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,160
existing and emerging wireless protocols

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,679
and infrastructures.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,359
Let me see how it works here. Uh my name

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:24,240
is Marco Ganuna. I am um leading the

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:27,519
founder and CEO of Kronos AI. This is

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:33,600
our team. Uh basically we are all not me

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:35,360
all from IBM, Intel and uh Microsoft

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,040
um

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,840
we 25 each 25 years of experience at

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,520
least. So what we do what what we do we

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,239
saw we are GPS alternative solution. So

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,000
um GPS has limitation as we know it

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,160
doesn't work indoor it doesn't work on

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,840
the ground and especially doesn't work

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,600
during war zone because all the the GPS

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,320
is jammed um

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,119
we basically come up with this solution

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,680
which is uh the way GPS works you have

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
four satellite GPS satellite 20,000

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
kilometer high and a cheap receiver on

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,880
your phone or other devices here we

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,479
replace the satellite with these little

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,600
devices. So when you put four of those

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,520
on the floor on the wall, it will

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,200
selfcalibrate

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,840
form a mesh network of indoor 20 m up,

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,200
down, left, right, front, back within

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,560
which it detects and locate badge or

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,759
tags can be smaller than that. um in

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,280
three dimension with an accuracy of 50

33
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,320
cm

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,399
and 10 times a second refresh rate

35
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,479
without GPS satellite, without cell

36
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,880
towers, without internet, without

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,159
nothing. It just forms a mesh and

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,640
actually it's a v the visualization is

39
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,439
by any authorized screen. When you

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,000
connect with the mesh via Bluetooth, you

41
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,600
see all the people going up and down all

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the tags. So you can put the tags on

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,759
people and equipment and you'll see you

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
have situation awareness of everything

45
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
around indoor but most importantly

46
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440
because we selfc calibrate in few

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,080
seconds you can put those on drones. So

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
when you put four drones you fly them

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,239
above a building. So you and you're

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,200
going to be able to detect locate uh

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,560
tags on people and equipment outdoor but

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
also inside the building in three

53
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,319
dimension. So when you have the the

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,840
anchors and tax this is called active

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,599
tracking. What we do also is that we we

56
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
working on passive tracking to be able

57
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,760
to detect locate cell phone signals.

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,280
Everybody should uh I mean have a cell

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,920
phone usually and um basically the

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,440
accuracy of the cell phone signals is

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,200
not as good as 50 cm is around three to

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,040
5 mters but you are able to basically

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,920
see heat maps of people that are you

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,640
know in a building or outside. Um

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,120
so so I mean the first market we have I

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,519
mean I always forget to

67
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,200
yeah how it works. So I I just said how

68
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,280
it works. Uh technology readiness active

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,239
tracking is TRL7. This means that we

70
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,040
have pilots going. Um the passive

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,159
tracking is TRL 4 and five. It's

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,799
basically detecting any radio frequency

73
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:37,120
around. Um when you put those on drones

74
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,519
outdoor the um we can the coverage is

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,920
1.8 8 kilometer.

76
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
And that's quite interesting. And the

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,879
most import most important is that when

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,920
you have those drones up and you have

79
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,560
people moving or troops or firefighters

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,560
moving around, you can just move the

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,159
drones above the the area you desire and

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,159
in few seconds you will see all the

83
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,159
movements.

84
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:09,280
Um we have many project in development.

85
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,920
Um actually very interesting. Um what

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,400
our focus right now and it is our lowest

87
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,400
hanging fruit is military. Uh we are

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
working with uh the Navy. We have a

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,880
Kada. We signed with them. We have seven

90
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,840
projects with them. We are working

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,520
closely with with uh DARPA with SOCOM.

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,880
Actually next week we're going to be in

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,800
Fort Campbell. Um and most importantly

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,400
we are also in public safety. We signed

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,639
with 3M. 3M owns 70% of North American

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,040
market for first responders.

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,280
Hopefully by mid next year to end of

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
next year, every firefighter will be

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,639
able to geocate each other in burning

100
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
buildings, but they're going to be able

101
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,639
to detect and locate the victim's cell

102
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,080
phone signals. Perfect for FEMA. You

103
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,520
send those drones and you find people

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,720
that are uh you know in trouble.

105
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,280
avalanche. It goes, we think it's going

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,600
to go with 3 mters deep. So, you are

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,280
able to find people that are in in in

108
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,440
distress. Um,

109
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,639
so that's what I said. I'm always aware

110
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,800
and we have also smart cities. Uh so you

111
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,800
can basically place those uh you can

112
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,400
preset those anchors into buildings and

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,600
you're going to be able to detect and

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,360
locate uh movement of people and assets

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:35,360
with where when maybe you hate it but

116
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,840
this is where we're going uh and um and

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,080
it's for security but also being having

118
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,639
a location situation awareness of

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,160
movements and I think this is the the

120
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,680
future

121
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:54,240
um So that's about uh us. I still have

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,400
137 uh minutes. Um so if you have any

123
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,639
questions, please do. Uh something I

124
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,600
didn't say is that um we we've done some

125
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,199
very interesting test in u firefighters

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,440
burning buildings. And despite the the

127
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,319
thickness of the walls, it was 3 ft

128
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,240
reinforced concrete walls and all the

129
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,160
ceilings were metal plates which is very

130
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,680
bad for very difficult for radio

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,520
frequency. We were able to see everybody

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,960
going in three floors with four anchors.

133
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,840
Um placing the anchors outside

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,440
the building. Uh the business model

135
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,919
there is going to be that every

136
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,479
hopefully every fire uh firefighter

137
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,960
trucks will have two of those and as

138
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,360
there is always at least two trucks in a

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,840
fireplace and when there is a fire

140
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,160
they're going to basically the form the

141
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,160
mesh network.

142
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,089
[applause]

143
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,600
>> Thank you Marco. Any questions from the

144
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,600
audience? Yes.

145
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,599
>> Thank you. Can you clarify what is that

146
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,479
in your hand?

147
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
>> It's an anchor.

148
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,880
>> It's an anchor.

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
>> Okay. What you have in there?

150
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
>> Yeah.

151
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,639
>> Is what you have in your phone.

152
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
>> Okay.

153
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,840
>> It's ultra wideband

154
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,639
>> with it's no secret ultra wideband uh

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:18,000
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in there. And um we

156
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,120
have uh eight categories of patents, 41

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,880
granted patents on this geocation.

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,280
So the goal is basically to migrate into

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,199
the phone. So if we were able to have

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919
access to the ultra wideband in the

161
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,759
phone, so every four phones here will

162
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
form automatically mesh network.

163
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
>> Yeah. Okay.

164
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,520
>> So that's the idea.

165
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
>> And and in your right hand, that's a

166
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
tag, is it?

167
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,639
>> It's a tag. It's basically a Bluetooth

168
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
Bluetooth power on and there is a

169
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,319
battery in there.

170
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,680
>> Okay.

171
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,759
>> A year and basically we can design it.

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
We are designing even smaller tags.

173
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,680
>> Okay. And some go.

174
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,039
>> Yeah. You said the location is uh

175
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
calculated locally is on one of those

176
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,319
devices.

177
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
>> Yes.

178
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,759
>> So basically you have those four the the

179
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,599
four anchors that calculates uh 10 times

180
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
a second of every tags.

181
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
>> No cloud.

182
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,680
>> No cloud. No nothing. You have just a

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,520
knuck that collects all the data

184
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,400
location that is connected to your user

185
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,919
interface and just you process the

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,160
information on the edge. You don't need

187
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
anything out. Now if you have you need

188
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
more edge processing and you have a

189
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
connection you can connect it to to the

190
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
cloud and do whatever you want. So we

191
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,479
give an API to our customers so they can

192
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,490
process it. Thank you. The other thing

193
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:38,800
that is something important also um

194
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:41,279
[clears throat] the tags the the anchors

195
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
those anchors become

196
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,200
a tag when they move.

197
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,320
>> Yeah. So this means that what we're

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,000
doing is we're going to a 3D morphic had

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,000
oak indooroutdoor mesh network. That's

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
where we're going.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
>> So you may have mentioned earlier uh the

202
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,200
diameter of the network. So once the

203
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,240
four-point network is the mesh is made

204
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
what's the maximum diameter of control?

205
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
>> The maximum

206
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,080
>> diameter

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
>> 1.8 kilometer

208
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
>> 1.8 kilmters

209
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
>> outdoor.

210
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,000
>> Outdoor.

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,000
>> Yes. Uh we have a few developments right

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,839
now actually one specific development

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,880
that will increase tremendously

214
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,240
uh the diameter.

215
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,279
Um but I mean this for DoD so I cannot

216
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,279
speak very much about it.

217
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
>> Two more questions.

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,040
>> I'm just curious if these have been

219
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,720
tested underwater. I know you mentioned

220
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
maritime deployment. Has that been

221
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,760
proven yet or

222
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,959
>> we are working on this and we just

223
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,760
started it's going to be like submarine

224
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,560
drones

225
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,959
>> I think

226
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,080
>> one more and move to the next one

227
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,920
>> in in the mode where the tag is is a

228
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
passive device.

229
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,160
>> Mhm.

230
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,240
>> The there I'll I'll form it as a

231
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,240
question. Is there a mode where the tag

232
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,440
the moving tag is a completely passive

233
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,160
device without a battery? It could and

234
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,880
it will light up only when

235
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,079
when

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
>> is that one of the modes you've been

237
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,959
testing?

238
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
>> Yes.

239
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,360
>> How much power do you need to be

240
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,959
transmitting?

241
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,160
>> Okay, that's a very good question. It's

242
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:28,480
a we uh do 50 mill watt but uh we have

243
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,399
also the the pot on on a spot do up to

244
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,560
50 mill 500 mill. So we are able to go

245
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
through walls and

246
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,200
uh one the same development is asking

247
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,880
for four watts but uh but already at 500

248
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,760
millwatts we are um we are above FCC

249
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,839
approval.

250
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,422
>> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]

251
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,440
>> Okay. Thank you.

252
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:53,040
[applause]

253
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,040
>> Great questions. Thank you so much

254
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Marco.
