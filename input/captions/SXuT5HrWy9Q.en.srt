Hi, my name is Maddie Clark and I'm a

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
Applicants should apply when they feel

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
that their application is at their

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
strongest. We strongly encourage

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
international applicants to apply by our

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,240
round one deadline in order to have

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
ample time for the various onboarding

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
processes, including the student visa

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,640
process.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
Sloan is looking for accomplished

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,920
professionals who are ready to take

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,239
their careers from success to

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,160
significance. We're looking for folks

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,640
who are strong communicators and have

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,640
demonstrated leadership and impact in

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,960
their professional careers. For the

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,040
Sloan Fellow's MBA, we require a minimum

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
especially interested in candidates who

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,200
have general management experience.

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
Ultimately, we're looking for candidates

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
who can contribute meaningfully to the

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,760
Sloan classroom and who will go on to be

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,760
principled innovative leaders in their

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,760
communities, organizations, and

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
industries.
