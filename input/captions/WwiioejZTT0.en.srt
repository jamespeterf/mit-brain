1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,560
good morning everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,240
today's MPG primer and today it is my

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,360
pleasure to introduce U or reintroduce

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,519
Sarah Morton Sarah Morton has been a

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,719
pivotal um member of the mpg Community

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,400
having served as the co-chair of this

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,519
primary series for several years um and

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,519
has some interesting outlooks about what

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,960
she'll be doing next with MPG so hold

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,279
tight for that uh so just a little bit

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,279
about Sarah Morton she is a

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,160
neonatologist at Boston Children's

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
Hospital and assistant professor of

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,640
pediatrics at Harvard Medical School her

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
research group is focused on genetic

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,239
contributions to congenital heart

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,520
disease and Associated Health outcomes

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
she is also the director of the niku

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,960
biobank at Boston Children's Hospital

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,360
and is glad to talk to you today about

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,079
bio banking big and small thank you so

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
much Sarah thank you so much thank you

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,680
all for being here today desite despite

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
the rain and slush um and so I'm really

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,879
glad to share with you a little bit of

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,840
what I know about biobanks but would

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,360
love this to be interactive so if you

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,640
have questions or thoughts as we go

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,040
along um I'd be really really uh glad to

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,920
engage uh but I think the perspective I

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,759
was thinking of is you know if primer

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
series is for people who are you know

33
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,720
maybe earlier on and designing projects

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,799
and and thinking about our scientific

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,439
Community what is it that you might want

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,960
to know if you wanted to set up a

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,799
biobank what is it you might want to

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,720
know if you're accessing a biobank about

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,000
how the data are obtained and the

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,400
decisions that are are made uh in this

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,560
setting up and then I'll give you the

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,320
example of our local biobank which will

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,600
have the definite theme of everything in

44
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,079
Pediatrics is smaller but I also think

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,920
that sometimes our effect sizes are

46
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,240
larger uh so there's something to be

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,399
learned from kind of every every type of

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,399
of

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,759
cohort uh and so uh through the talk

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,520
today we'll talk a little bit about the

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,600
general principles of biobanking and

52
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,039
that's where the why what who comes in

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
uh I'll talk about some of the Exemplar

54
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,119
ones that I'm sure you're all familiar

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
with but what I'll be sharing with a

56
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,840
little bit is like what does the

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,520
protocol look like for all of us what

58
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,439
did they decide to do with samples for

59
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,080
UK biobank uh so that you can see what

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,080
are the tradeoffs between scale cost um

61
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,519
and kind of preserving questions that

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,720
can be answered in the future that we

63
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,519
can't even anticipate now um and then

64
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,879
I'll tell you about our our local one

65
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,160
over at the

66
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,040
ncu uh so what's a biobank what's a bio

67
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,640
repository we kind of all smoos the

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
words together uh what do is are there

69
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,160
kind is there a significance to the

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
different ones and I would say a bior

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,200
repository is a larger umbrella term

72
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,879
that is when there is a banking or kind

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,360
of a storage of tissues or samples that

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,760
come from any kind of living organism

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
and so often when people talk about a

76
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,560
bior repository it might include

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,360
bacterial cell lines or tissue culture

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,560
lines uh from non-human animals and so a

79
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,080
bior repository is the gener more

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,480
general term of which a biobank tends to

81
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,519
refer to bio repositories that only

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,959
include human uh human

83
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,720
samples and so the other thing that

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,280
makes a biobank is not just that you've

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,159
stored it so having a freezer is not

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,120
necessarily a biobank uh but that the

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,760
specimens were lit were collected for

88
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,560
the purpose of advancing uh medical and

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,319
health knowledge and that's important

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
because you can't just have a sample you

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,680
need to know who it came from what were

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,959
the situations in which it was collected

93
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,680
um perhaps even what has happened since

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,360
that person participated what are those

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,480
longer term outcomes and so what makes a

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
biobank is not just the sample but the

97
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,159
meta dat that come with it um and and

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,920
sometimes you might spend as much effort

99
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,159
uh and as much of your budget on getting

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,400
those Associated metadata as you do on

101
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,200
the actual processing and storage of the

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,439
samples

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,000
um the other thing that makes it

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,319
different is that there are kind of

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,239
standard operating procedures and a set

106
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,360
of govern in principles that you should

107
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,280
adhere to when having a biobank and so

108
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,920
there needs to be a standard operating

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,360
procedure for the acquisition of the

110
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,799
samples for the processing and labeling

111
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,280
of the samples um and for storage and

112
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,720
distribution and so if you are either

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,799
trying to access a data a biobank or

114
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,959
setting one up yourself knowing how to

115
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,759
enter each of those different phases um

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,720
and how to understand how a sample you

117
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,919
might be using was processed is one of

118
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
those things that you can really dig

119
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,360
into a uh in the metad data my favorite

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
thing about a biobank is always its data

121
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,479
dictionary uh because if you know what

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,800
they know uh then you can also start to

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,400
understand a little bit about what might

124
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,840
be um missing that you would need to

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,520
infer uh or or acknowledge as a

126
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,479
limitation in your own

127
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,000
study um biobanks are so exciting right

128
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,240
now right there's they're growing

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,520
there's National ones there's

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
International ones every hospital has

131
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,000
one they're adding metadata they're

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
adding EMR you can do natural language

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
processing uh you write on medical

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,280
records that are linked to biobanks and

135
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,240
so it really is an area where there's

136
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,000
been a tremendous amount of growth both

137
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
in terms of the number of biobanks and

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,840
the scope of their uh purposes may I ask

139
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,600
a question about that what do you think

140
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,800
are some of the reasons of why this is

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,960
sort of booming right

142
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,240
now um I like to think it's because

143
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,840
there's a lot that as we advance

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,759
genetics some of our animal models and

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,759
cell culture models which have given us

146
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,600
so many insights into the fundamental

147
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,919
biology underlying health and disease um

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,680
that we've come to realize that a lot of

149
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,440
the fruitful advances recently have been

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,960
very specific to the human genome and

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,440
very specific to human physiology and so

152
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,000
I think that um some of the Boom is the

153
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,360
focus on moving towards having

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,280
understanding our fundamental biology

155
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,000
but also moving towards having new

156
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,240
Therapeutics or new Diagnostics um uh in

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,720
the near term and so I think biobanks

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,840
are a nice opportunity to bridge our

159
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,600
basic science and our cellular and

160
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,840
animal models um as a nice demonstration

161
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,520
of applicability uh before you go to

162
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,080
like a phase one trial or something like

163
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,000
that thinking about developing

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,520
Therapeutics so I think of them as

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,360
having a nice role in making it's you

166
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,800
can kind of take all of your science and

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,440
you know make sure that it holds true uh

168
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,440
in a human

169
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,080
population um yeah and so you know this

170
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,000
is not a tough crowd to say population

171
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,599
genetics is important right uh but like

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,400
you know having these broad uh diverse

173
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,080
representative cohorts really lets us

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,599
interpret variance like when I think

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,960
about you know we do genetic testing on

176
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,520
on patients in the ncu regularly at

177
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
least once a week someone gets a genome

178
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,360
sent and our ability to interpret those

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,160
variants now because your Al frequency

180
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,240
can go down to 10 theg5 or 10 to the6 in

181
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,879
the general population right those those

182
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,280
kind of data come from kind you know our

183
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,160
in large part for efforts of our our

184
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,360
biobanks um

185
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,120
and also you know just having many

186
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,199
biobanks as we'll talk about will be

187
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,280
able to share with you cells and perhaps

188
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,599
even um the cells that can be made into

189
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,879
IPS cells and so that does let you look

190
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,800
at molecular mechanisms among people who

191
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,000
you might know their genotype as well as

192
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,160
their kind of medical history uh and

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
then you know again switching and

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,560
thinking about interventions it's a

195
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,639
great place to look at questions like

196
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,199
pharmacogenomics where we've come in the

197
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,599
past five years to understand so much

198
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,560
more about how our generalizations from

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,120
limited population are not really

200
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,039
representative to our entire uh patient

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,680
Community I just thought this was really

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,440
cool that's a picture of like the inside

203
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,680
of the UK biobank it's just from their

204
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,479
website um but really thinking about how

205
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,639
sophisticated many of these operations

206
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,080
are with um you know almost no one

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,360
touching a sample once it's been

208
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,879
collected right uh and having the

209
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,440
automation both to reduce our amount of

210
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,440
uh potential contamination and

211
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,360
differences in handling but also really

212
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,680
um to

213
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,280
uh allow a scalability that's not

214
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,280
possible without

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,440
automation I came up with my title

216
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,879
before I found this paper but I found it

217
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,319
very interesting that we had the same

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
kind of way of breaking down how to

219
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,840
understand a biobank right which is if

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
you're really thinking about using one

221
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,159
or thinking about starting your own you

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,199
need to figure out what your scope is

223
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,400
and to me these same sets of like write

224
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,520
the five W's plus how at the end uh is

225
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,279
is a great way to Define which biobank

226
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,279
might be right for you or or how you

227
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,800
might start your own if you needed to um

228
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,159
and so we'll go through these more in

229
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,039
detail but really why is obviously the

230
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,399
first one so either why would you access

231
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,080
a biobank sample um or why would you

232
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,160
start your own usually has to do with uh

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,720
as Nicole asked like what is that key

234
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,480
question that's where there's a gap in

235
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,080
your science where either having a bios

236
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,080
specimen having uh you know U metadata

237
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,959
or aggregated or single information from

238
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,320
a population would answer your research

239
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,920
question the what is one of the things

240
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
that changes the most uh so our we have

241
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,920
a biobank over at Children's right now

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,800
and they're just going through the

243
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
process of pretty much only keeping

244
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,640
white blood cell pellets so there had

245
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,640
been a lot of serum or plasma that was

246
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,000
stored for a long time and it turned out

247
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,640
those just hadn't been accessed by

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,519
researchers right people were interested

249
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,760
far more in the DNA uh and so as the

250
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,760
scale of the samples became large enough

251
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,399
to require expansion or selection of

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,839
samples they chose selection of samp

253
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,320
examples right so the what definitely

254
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,839
changes over time and a lot of the what

255
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,800
is electronic now right it's your

256
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,000
wearable device data it's questionnaires

257
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,959
filled out um by by participants things

258
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,880
like

259
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,720
that um the when part I think is

260
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,320
uniquely interesting in terms of

261
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,000
thinking we used to think of a lot of

262
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,000
our research participation as a single

263
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,680
event you fill out one questionnaire and

264
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
give one sample and that was your

265
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,760
participation in the research study and

266
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,680
now it's become much more long itudinal

267
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,519
and people are more willing to share a

268
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,360
lot of their personal information in uh

269
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,680
in an ongoing way than they were in the

270
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,600
past uh and I think though there will be

271
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,360
differences in who contributes data and

272
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,480
who has time to contribute data that we

273
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,399
always need to be cognant of uh it it

274
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,440
definitely has expanded the when um of

275
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,440
of interaction especially with passive

276
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,200
drawing of data from the electronic

277
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,560
medical record right so that requires

278
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,880
you to just return to care from the

279
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,800
place you enrolled

280
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
uh but that's another way to get kind of

281
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,600
longitudinal data from

282
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,680
individuals um we'll talk about the wear

283
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,399
especially when we talk about all of us

284
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,040
but that's been another place where you

285
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,200
know it used to be Hospital based or

286
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,680
institution-based but there's been a lot

287
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,040
more biobanks with a Community Focus in

288
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,040
terms of Outreach and enrollment um

289
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,839
where where that part has changed uh and

290
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,880
then I think the who the from a

291
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,320
pediatrician one of my my biggest

292
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
perspectives on this is everyone I

293
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,839
enroll because their parents consent I

294
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,680
would need to reenroll once they reach

295
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,200
age of majority uh and so from for me

296
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,000
most most of the who's people can always

297
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,800
opt out uh but one of the things to

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,240
think about When approaching pediatric

299
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,839
populations is there's actually an

300
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,519
active need to opt in once you reach age

301
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,120
of majority we don't just because their

302
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,200
parents said yes when they were a day

303
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,279
old doesn't mean that they um as an

304
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,560
adult will say yes themselves and so

305
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,200
that's one of the things I think about

306
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,360
most with the who is just making sure

307
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,639
that we you know not just passively

308
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,440
accept people's choices to opt out but

309
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,440
there is actually a need to to

310
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
proactively uh confirm

311
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,920
consent uh so if you think about why to

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,040
start a biobank why did I start the niku

313
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,160
biobank why did people start UK biobank

314
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,279
there's very different motivations right

315
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
depending on kind of your scale and your

316
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,360
catchment

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,200
um sometimes it might be started for a

318
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,440
specific project uh for example many

319
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,480
times there might be patient registries

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,480
that are associated with a clinic or a

321
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,079
uh an organization that represents

322
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,240
people who have a particular diagnosis

323
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,680
and so those Registries are now often

324
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,680
expanding to also include a biobank

325
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,560
those are often optional and that the

326
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,000
primary project is still the registry

327
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,199
and collecting um non-bio specimens but

328
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,279
sometimes biobanks are an add-on to a

329
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,440
project that's been going on for

330
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519
sometimes decades uh but now collecting

331
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,720
bios specimens in addition and

332
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,320
especially with the advances in ility to

333
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,440
do nice genomic sequencing from saliva

334
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,560
samples this doesn't even require anyone

335
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,480
to see a needle or show up in your state

336
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,160
uh and so that can be a way that people

337
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,959
do expand uh bios specimens we're doing

338
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,680
this right now for a study of adults

339
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,560
with congenital heart disease who are

340
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,279
now in their 30s and had their

341
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,639
operations generally in their first week

342
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,560
of life and it's been amazing how they

343
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,279
participated in this research study over

344
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,360
decades and one of the ways that we've

345
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,720
gotten bios specimens for that study is

346
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,279
literally we just send them a SP kit and

347
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,760
they send it back and then all the

348
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,079
sequencing happens here uh and so it's a

349
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,120
it's a nice way to be able to expand our

350
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,639
data types on studies where we might

351
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,079
actually already have that longitudinal

352
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,360
information but we've never been able to

353
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:18,079
consider the genetics in the in the

354
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,600
questions uh uh sometimes there might be

355
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,120
a planned analysis I'll show you an

356
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,040
example of this later I tried to make my

357
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,760
uh our biobank such that you know I U I

358
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,040
last night uh when I was working the ncu

359
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,760
cared for two instants with tr me 18

360
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,240
right uh and that's not everyone's every

361
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,560
day uh so I am very privileged that I

362
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,279
get to meet a lot of families and

363
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,600
infants who are affected by diagnoses

364
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,519
that are rare in the general population

365
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,680
and to me it was always a tragedy that a

366
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,800
fellow might show up five years later

367
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,680
and want to study Tri 18 but we would

368
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,680
have no samples for them right there

369
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,320
would be no place for them to start from

370
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,480
even though we had uh you know some of

371
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,600
the most uh ability to to start

372
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,639
collecting those samples and so we've

373
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,399
made our IRB such that a fellow can come

374
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,279
with a question uh we will do all the

375
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,560
consenting and Sample collection and

376
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:11,199
they do a secondary analysis of

377
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,680
available research consent uh and so

378
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,120
there that process becomes much more

379
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,639
easy for them and then we also have just

380
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,160
you know the accumulated knowledge of

381
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,160
the years that it takes to get a

382
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,120
reasonable cohort so that's an example

383
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,079
of a time where there might be a planned

384
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,680
analysis but we're just kind of adding

385
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,199
on the specific data types uh that we

386
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,320
need uh then there's the more General

387
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:33,680
projects so these are the ones we're

388
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,440
familiar with the UK biobank the Japan

389
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,600
biobank all of us and so there's often

390
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,079
broad participant recruitment this is

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,839
where the metadata might be a little

392
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
more variable it might fit your study

393
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,199
but might be missing some pieces right

394
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,120
like in the nicku there's all these

395
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,639
things we collect about what were you

396
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,040
know what was maternal what was the um

397
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,120
health of the pregnant person during

398
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,759
pregnancy what was the what were the

399
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
incidents that happened right around

400
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,639
delivery birth weight it's amazing how

401
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
hard it can be to find someone's birth

402
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,160
weight uh Even in our Hospital sometimes

403
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,519
if they transfer to us two months later

404
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,800
it might never enter our medical record

405
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,600
um and so there is a lot of more details

406
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,279
that we catch in our targeted uh

407
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
metadata which might not be present in

408
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,600
the general projects uh and then there's

409
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,959
a lot of times where people come up with

410
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,959
cool new techniques like um right EP

411
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,959
signatures of different congenital

412
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,839
anomalies and all of a sudden we already

413
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,759
have this biobank and so we didn't know

414
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,920
that that's what we were going to be

415
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,399
doing with our samples but now that as

416
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,319
those technologies have progressed and

417
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,880
the research questions come to Encompass

418
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:36,639
our population uh we're able to then set

419
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,800
up the uh appropriate agreements uh to

420
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,800
be able to transfer those

421
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,519
samples um so who is in the biobank

422
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,680
obviously determines your ability to

423
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:53,120
learn from the samples in the biobank uh

424
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,000
and so one thing is always read the fine

425
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,600
print and so if you read what the

426
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,920
inclusion and exclusion criteria are for

427
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,079
a bio Bank you're thinking of accessing

428
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,000
that can help you know at the start what

429
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,720
the caveats will be to your

430
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,880
analysis

431
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,959
um there again I mentioned this before

432
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,440
but just anyone who's enrolled uh under

433
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,240
the age of 18 tends to need active

434
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,040
reconsent now that's a change in the

435
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,319
past three years or so it used to be

436
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,519
that people didn't really require that

437
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:24,480
reconsent um but pretty much everyone

438
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,720
now is making is having their uh IRB

439
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,279
protocols revised to uh include that

440
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,399
reconsent and then just a couple of ways

441
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,800
that we do in our biobank to be

442
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,759
representative um is we have all of our

443
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,000
research approaches be regardless of

444
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,040
preferred language um our Hospital

445
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,600
actually does not have any charge for

446
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,480
use of interpreter services for research

447
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
uh so there should be no barrier uh to

448
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,000
enrolling anyone or approaching anyone

449
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,079
for research who's eligible um and then

450
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,040
pursuing a consent if they are

451
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,560
interested in hearing more um and I

452
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,920
actually think that's a really important

453
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,319
part because many protocols that still

454
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,279
come to our IRB we'll say English only

455
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:05,640
or English Spanish only because it's a

456
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,280
pilot study um but there's actually a

457
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,360
really nice thing called a short form

458
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,439
consent and what that is is that there's

459
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,240
a much shorter form of the consent which

460
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,559
is uh translated by The Interpreter and

461
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,319
then the the larger consent is verbally

462
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,439
translated in the moment uh and so there

463
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,559
are ways to be able to not have to have

464
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,520
your documents in every single language

465
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,839
but still be able to provide a r a

466
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,720
robust consenting process um that

467
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,840
doesn't limit particip based on

468
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,600
preferred

469
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,919
language um uh things like uh so this is

470
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,320
again maybe a little more nicku focused

471
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,440
um but not everyone's going to be

472
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,400
available to stay an extra half hour

473
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,360
after their Clinic visit not everyone's

474
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,480
going to be available to 9 to5 uh and so

475
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,919
having things like off hours consenting

476
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,080
having um remote consenting which has

477
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,039
been it was were there any Silver

478
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,919
Linings to everything becoming remote

479
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,960
for a while uh you know being able to

480
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,960
have some online consents where people

481
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,880
can read at their Leisure uh there's no

482
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,120
one in the room uh they can take their

483
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,440
time to ask their questions but be able

484
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,200
to be as synchronist in some of that uh

485
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:16,440
can be another way to be more inclusive

486
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,880
um uh and then also I think helping I

487
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,559
know why I would participate in a

488
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,559
research study I dragged my kids around

489
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,280
to be people you know they had so many

490
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,559
of those like motion balls attached to

491
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
them for some study right uh like many

492
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,280
of us participate in research for all

493
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,679
kinds of different reasons and what

494
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,919
actually matters is not why I

495
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,799
participate but why other people who

496
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,200
have chosen to participate in that

497
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,760
biobank or that research study uh and so

498
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,919
I think as much as possible having the

499
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,280
voices of participants represented in

500
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,960
your brochures um in your Flyers uh even

501
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,720
you know like on the screens that are

502
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,960
around every place where someone might

503
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,840
wait for their consent um having the

504
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,679
voices of people who really participated

505
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,840
and why they did uh can be one of the

506
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,360
most compelling things uh and so I think

507
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,200
that's something that can also help you

508
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,039
have a more representative uh uh

509
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:07,520
biobank um and then just thinking about

510
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:10,400
again location uh you know if you uh if

511
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,559
you only recruit in our nicku you're not

512
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,000
going to get the average neonate right

513
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,320
and so we're really good in answering

514
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,720
some questions and terrible at others um

515
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,200
so just making sure that if you're going

516
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,080
to access a biobank understanding how it

517
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,919
was that people were approached uh

518
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,039
because it's uh again when it's uh

519
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,880
location specific people usually either

520
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,400
were there or not there for for some

521
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,400
underlying

522
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,000
reasons um so what is banked um

523
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,159
this uh talks about all the different

524
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,039
things there this was a the image is

525
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,280
talking about one that was an oncology

526
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,360
example uh and so I liked it because it

527
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,240
focused on the participant pathway so

528
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,440
this set their participant starting at

529
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,039
the bottom left um and so people often

530
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,320
provide a lot of things they'll provide

531
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,520
bio samples some of them are passively

532
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,880
collected like our biobank uh at

533
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,440
Children's Hospital we we're actually

534
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,400
really good at using not very much blood

535
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,760
for testing it's not quite thos level

536
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,960
but we do things on very small volumes

537
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,520
but they even save the rest of that very

538
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,360
small volume because they know that some

539
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,840
of our right some of my patients are 500

540
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,840
grams you can't take a lot of blood from

541
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,520
them um and so with that they'll

542
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,120
actually save whatever is left after the

543
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,520
test was run in case I want to add on

544
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,320
another test like oh I needed the liver

545
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,240
function but now I'd really also like to

546
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,400
add on you know my ALB men or my

547
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,200
electrolytes or something like that um

548
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
and so they already had this culture of

549
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,960
saving the remnants and so all you had

550
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,799
to do was say well after you've reached

551
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,919
that Remnant part for retesting how

552
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,840
about that just goes to our biobank and

553
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,520
so there are ways to participate that

554
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,080
don't require extra uh needle exposures

555
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,080
or extra bios specimen collections

556
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,919
similarly sometimes operative tissues

557
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,679
are the most valuable right because you

558
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,000
might be studying a condition that is

559
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,320
not easily accessible or or directly

560
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,799
studied from blood CSF or urine

561
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,200
something else that comes out of us more

562
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,600
easily um and so having that pipeline to

563
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:11,159
be able to access surgically um excise

564
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,400
tissues is also a high a high yield

565
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,960
place and so again those biosamples

566
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,480
might be population based in which case

567
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,679
you're grabbing whatever's left over or

568
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,520
generally taking blood uh or they might

569
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,120
be very disease oriented in which case

570
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,520
you really want that tumor tissue that

571
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,799
was removed right or you really want um

572
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,400
uh the cereal spinal fluid because what

573
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,559
you're looking for is really a central

574
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,960
nervous system process uh the

575
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,799
demographic data which is now more and

576
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,240
more passively collected from electronic

577
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,400
medical records but obviously can be

578
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,320
from a a survey also clinical data is

579
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,600
really interesting I spend a lot of my

580
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,520
time with ICD codes ICD codes were meant

581
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,440
for me to be able to bill for me to say

582
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,720
to the insurer this patient's really

583
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,640
sick or this patient's not that sick

584
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,120
right and that's how we communicate with

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,039
payers to justify the hospitalization or

586
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,120
procedures or whatever else there is

587
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,799
they were not intended for research and

588
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,960
the things I say match the current

589
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,559
condition someone might have respiratory

590
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,480
failure they need a ventilator but it's

591
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,840
because they just had surgery and they

592
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,640
had anesthesia and need to recover it's

593
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,000
not because they primarily have a of you

594
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,559
know failure of their lungs and so

595
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
there's a lot of things like that where

596
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,520
what you're actually getting in ICD

597
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,559
codes is secondary and not primary and

598
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,000
and those codes don't always discern

599
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,640
those things so my biggest lesson or my

600
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,480
biggest message about clinical data it's

601
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,960
like buy or beware for your ICD codes um

602
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,559
and we've looked at things like defining

603
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,039
ADHD or Autism Spectrum disorders using

604
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,559
ICD codes across nine centers of our

605
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:50,640
congenital heart disease study and the

606
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,799
diagnostic rate R ranges from 1% to 60%

607
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,840
and I don't think it's because the

608
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,039
people who are receiving care are

609
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,120
different right there's differences in

610
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,080
how the codes translate to words at each

611
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,679
Hospital

612
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,080
um there's differences in how many codes

613
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,600
people click uh and so that's one of the

614
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,640
things about clinical data is I was

615
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,240
always just kind of as much as you can

616
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,159
do a little bit of ground truth checking

617
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,200
uh even if it's at a single Center or a

618
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,720
couple of centers uh or use something

619
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,600
like natural language processing as an

620
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
orthogonal measure that that's one of

621
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,480
the important things to think about for

622
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,720
clinical data um there's often directed

623
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,440
study evaluations they might be you know

624
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,000
directed neurodevelopmental testing we

625
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,559
do a lot right so we'll do these tests

626
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,520
called the Bailey tests which is how

627
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,960
know someone's fine motor versus gross

628
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,600
motor versus cognitive performance um so

629
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,760
there can be directed study tests and

630
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,760
those are often the ones that are most

631
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,000
high quality because they'll many times

632
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,320
be standardized right where everyone

633
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,799
who's administering the test has gone

634
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,480
through the same training uh there's

635
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,840
some crosschecking where it might the

636
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,880
test might even be administered by two

637
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,200
different people for some period of time

638
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,039
to make sure that there's a lot of

639
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,919
cohesion so many times it's those

640
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,039
directed study evaluations that are the

641
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,720
most harmonious uh to use between

642
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,039
centers or overtime

643
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,000
uh and then the questionnaires which are

644
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,080
just lovely because many times that's

645
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,240
the only way you get the participants

646
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,679
experience of life right how do you know

647
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,279
someone's quality of life how do you

648
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,640
know someone's you know job satisfaction

649
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,559
or you know uh social satisfaction it's

650
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,919
not going to be from directed testing

651
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,520
right and many times those outcomes

652
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,840
aren't necessarily what studies are

653
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,080
designed to report uh but can be a

654
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,000
really significant thing especially

655
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,919
again thinking about Pediatrics it might

656
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
not be whether your IQ is 82 or 86 that

657
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
matters it might matter like are you

658
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,640
know what's your uh degree of completion

659
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,279
of your education what's your degree of

660
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,279
autonomy as you've you know become a

661
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,640
teenager things like that um so that's

662
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,440
where those questionnaires sometimes

663
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,520
actually do have better information than

664
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,799
or different and and more applicable

665
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,520
information than some of the

666
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,799
questionnaires or some of the directed

667
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,799
study

668
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,279
evaluations um and so if you do get your

669
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,080
bio sample there are really expensive

670
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,039
really fancy ways to handle bio samples

671
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,039
and there's really simple ways and they

672
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,840
just all have trade-offs and right it

673
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,120
depends somewhat on your your resources

674
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,200
and your scale uh so one of the when

675
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,600
you're running a large biobank people

676
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,799
have uh as many automated steps as

677
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,000
possible because that minimizes any

678
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:18,679
contamination spent a long time looking

679
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,159
at um like uh 16s sequences of samples

680
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,159
we had collected in Uganda transferred

681
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,720
to Pennsylvania sequence transferred

682
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,960
again to New York proteomics and there

683
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,600
was just so much decontamination you had

684
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,840
to do from every step that was handled

685
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,039
and we saw as many batch effects um from

686
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,720
each step of the handling as sometimes

687
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:41,279
we would see biologic effects right so

688
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,320
really automated handling um and uh

689
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,440
minimized repackaging is really

690
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,880
beneficial the most common things that

691
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,640
are stored are plasma serum and DNA uh

692
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,159
some people like the children's biobank

693
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,919
now are moving towards what's called The

694
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,320
Buffy coat it's just that it's white and

695
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,399
fluffy looking but it's basically the

696
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,399
white blood cells and that's because if

697
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,039
get blood the nucleated cells are the

698
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,760
white blood cells right and so that's

699
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,279
where your DNA is going to be you don't

700
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,320
need all those red cells they don't have

701
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,000
that information and so that's why

702
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,240
people are often now moving to just

703
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,960
saving the white blood cells um

704
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,919
sometimes the primary bone marrow cells

705
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,919
are also saved because those can those

706
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,640
if stored appropriately in liquid

707
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,520
nitrogen or colder uh can be turned into

708
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,279
IPS cells in the future so people like

709
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,799
those as like a way of being able to

710
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:30,520
access that particular genotype again

711
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,440
um other things can be urine which is

712
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,440
great because it comes for free cerebral

713
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,480
spinal fluid which we um which can often

714
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,799
be obtained in a slightly larger volume

715
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,880
during a routine procedure without any

716
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,360
injury as long as it's a small volume

717
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,080
and that's one of those ones that we try

718
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,640
not to miss when it's available um

719
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,679
because it does let you know um very

720
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,960
specific things about you know brain

721
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,080
metabolism infections things like that

722
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,679
um and then the big thing if you really

723
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,039
do have a biobank and are meeting all

724
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,600
the criteria is you have to have very

725
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:04,360
careful protocols about all the backups

726
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,760
uh and so you can't just have a freezer

727
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,399
and slap a sign on it that says biobank

728
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,279
actually as I'm sure you've all seen you

729
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,039
have freezers with monitors on them that

730
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:14,120
alert someone immediately if the

731
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:15,399
temperature is has changed and you also

732
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,080
have to have a plan for like if your

733
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:21,039
freezer goes down where do your samples

734
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,039
go immediately uh and things like

735
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,120
that um and so again this can be

736
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,440
anywhere it doesn't have to be a fancy

737
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,919
bio Bank it can be in a single lab um

738
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,760
all of our samples that don't go to the

739
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,880
main biobank just go to a shelf in my

740
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,840
freezer like it's it's fine they can go

741
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,200
there they just have to have the right

742
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,679
protections and and security uh

743
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
sometimes it's a collaborative biobank

744
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,200
within an institution of which we know

745
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,039
of many right there's the MGD MGB

746
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,039
biobank which is lovely children's has

747
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:48,360
ours um they're these National and

748
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,000
international ones uh We've accessed a

749
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,440
lot of these to be able to get cardiac

750
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,760
tissue right for first uh

751
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,320
transcriptomics because not everyone

752
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,960
saves cardiac tissue uh and so that's

753
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,640
where some of these big International

754
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,320
and and National Banks can be really

755
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,600
useful for rare samples uh that many

756
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,399
researchers can

757
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,080
use um and then just if you are a

758
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:12,600
biobank that's storing any intact human

759
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,799
cells you need to be in a facility uh

760
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,919
with a human tissue act license and so

761
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,279
that's why when you're filling out your

762
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,279
protocols for these things there are a

763
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,120
couple more requirements um but it's

764
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,120
actually not that onerous to meet the

765
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,200
the requirements there uh the major

766
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,120
things are you have to make sure you can

767
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,440
link your sample and your consent right

768
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,279
you can't keep anything that you can't

769
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,880
prove uh was was consented you have to

770
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:34,720
show that there's that tracking of

771
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,480
samples and fail safe measures and then

772
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Security in the building as well as the

773
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
local

774
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,880
freezer um the metadata is one of the

775
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,720
most variable things we I just last

776
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,720
night was assigning Mondo terms to

777
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,240
everyone in our niku biobank of which

778
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,840
Mondo doesn't cover a lot of like

779
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,240
neonatal disorders I was learning uh so

780
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,519
there's all the right there's the ICD

781
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,640
codes we talked about which are billing

782
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,399
codes which are meant to talk to payers

783
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,240
and so some people have tried to Dev

784
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,880
other codes which are more designed for

785
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,240
research and better capture uh someone's

786
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,880
actual I don't know molecular mechanism

787
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,279
of disease if you think about grouping

788
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,799
in that way uh and so

789
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,440
the you know there's often raw clinical

790
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,240
data that goes in as well as these other

791
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,600
kind of like meta metadata labels that

792
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,640
kind of uh accumulate the information

793
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,840
from the chart there's some really nice

794
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,519
ways to use Red Cap to just capture data

795
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,320
directly from the EMR which is always

796
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,480
the most it's kind of like the automated

797
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,159
handling of metadata so instead of

798
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,240
someone typing something in and missing

799
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,960
a decimal point uh you can actually just

800
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,159
have it directly pulled they still might

801
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,919
have missed the decimal point when they

802
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,240
first entered it but it at least is one

803
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,279
step of less

804
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,640
contamination um there's many

805
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,480
deidentified research uh deidentified

806
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,519
portals where you can actually do things

807
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,679
on uh the EMR

808
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,240
directly uh the data might be RW might

809
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,919
be curated and knowing the level to

810
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,760
which it was curated can be be helpful

811
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,679
um um and especially if there's a

812
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,519
phenotype that's already been studied in

813
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,919
that biobank reach out to that group and

814
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,760
get their phenotype labels right because

815
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,240
you you hate to have a different result

816
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,360
from the same cohort only because you

817
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,440
had a slightly different definition and

818
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,240
so even if what you're going to do is

819
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,840
purposefully different understanding um

820
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,080
the difference in your your kind of

821
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,760
labeling of a similar diagnosis can be

822
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,720
helpful to contextualize why your

823
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,640
results might differ from someone

824
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,440
else's uh and then again this is where

825
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,279
sometimes disease oriented biobanks will

826
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,200
have very different clinical data

827
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,600
available and that can be the benefit of

828
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
maybe going back and forth between a

829
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,519
more specific biobank and a more General

830
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,080
one in terms of maybe the the power you

831
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,120
get from the increased metadata and

832
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,960
granularity versus the power you get

833
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,159
from a large population and so I think

834
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,320
the two can work together nicely and

835
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,120
then you always want to know about the

836
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,559
sample when was it collected like we're

837
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,080
collecting placenta right now if you

838
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,559
collect it more than half an hour after

839
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,559
delivery it's like the pancreas it just

840
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,240
degrades and so you want to know when

841
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,120
that sample was collected some things it

842
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,559
doesn't matter as much cardiac tissue we

843
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,960
worked with up to 72 hours after it

844
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,000
became available that it was collected

845
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,840
uh and that's been just fine uh but

846
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,519
really knowing for your sample what that

847
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,080
time was and then making sure that that

848
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,360
time was not a factor in what you're

849
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,200
measuring later uh to know for yourself

850
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,679
that there wasn't a quality difference

851
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,000
um any processing right RNA later was

852
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:24,720
all the rage and now it's terrible and

853
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,519
so knowing if it was stored in different

854
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,240
kinds of media even if that was later

855
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,679
removed can really impact your ability

856
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,000
to interpret any kind of sequencing or

857
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,080
other processing that you do after um

858
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,120
the amount many times there's a standard

859
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,519
standard allocation so after the sample

860
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,399
arrives it might be split into five Alo

861
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,960
quats uh and so just knowing like how

862
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,320
many Alo quats remain for that sample

863
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,760
can be important for making your plans

864
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,440
because often there's like a an approval

865
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,000
that's needed if you're taking that very

866
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,240
last Alo quat um and so that's often an

867
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,159
important metadata uh and then the time

868
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,919
between collect and

869
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,240
freezing then there's all the study

870
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,240
deriv data there's a lot of measurements

871
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,279
now and as I mentioned this is area

872
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,840
that's just exploding in terms of people

873
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:13,000
giving all their digital device data um

874
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,399
the sequencing and many times it's

875
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,880
actually a requirement of accessing

876
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,039
biobank specimens is that you return the

877
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,039
raw and process data back to the biobank

878
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,960
so that it can be generally available

879
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,919
sometimes there's holds where you get

880
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
exclusive access for one year or two

881
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,039
years um after a study period uh but

882
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,720
that it comes back to the whole

883
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,600
community and that's been a common way

884
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,720
for biobanks to be able to grow their

885
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,919
resources while still allowing the

886
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,639
researchers who are funding the

887
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,279
sequencing to have time to complete

888
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,559
their

889
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,039
analyses um and then all the the

890
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,000
questionnaires that we had talked

891
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,480
about um so these are just some of the

892
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,519
kinds of biobanks that I think about and

893
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,360
we'll we'll cover very briefly one of

894
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:57,840
the oldest ones are actually these human

895
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,799
umbilical cord uh blood biobanks right

896
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,559
so if you go to deliver your baby people

897
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,080
will ask oh are you planning to bank the

898
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,440
cord blood and so literally what happens

899
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,639
is right there's this long umbilical

900
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,760
cord that uh connects the infant to the

901
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:13,200
placenta and they can just put a clamp

902
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,799
on each side and it goes in a a freezer

903
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,480
container and off to the biobank um and

904
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:21,440
so there uh the public ones uh are then

905
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,240
accessed by individuals who might need

906
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,399
some sort of stem cell therapy in the

907
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,320
future and since you are usually unable

908
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,919
to donate to yourself it's these public

909
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,440
Banks uh that allow uh for uh for

910
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,600
appropriate cells to be found for

911
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,240
individuals in need it's also they're

912
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,480
also available for research and so this

913
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,679
was one of the first examples of like

914
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,039
large scale biobanking there's 28 public

915
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,720
ones in the US uh and so that's uh yeah

916
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:48,120
one and so this was just showing the

917
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,600
number of people per year who had a uh

918
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,399
who received a treatment uh using the

919
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,519
publicly banked uh Core Blood uh from

920
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,720
from deliveries that people had donated

921
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,399
so it's you know in 201 it was a th

922
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,519
people that year and just seeing that it

923
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,519
was benefiting a good number of people

924
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,120
over 16 as well that's the green part of

925
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,880
those bars so it's you know benefiting

926
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,200
not only children but adults too to have

927
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,520
done this banking um that's all

928
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,240
Anonymous and

929
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,960
public um this is just from the all of

930
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,480
us they have very lovely documentation

931
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,040
again if you're going to use a biobank

932
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,879
if you just go onto their websites they

933
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,280
have all their protocol documents there

934
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,800
so you can see like what's actually the

935
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
standard operating procedure how are

936
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,159
people approached what's the sample

937
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,720
handling um and so one of the unique

938
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:37,079
things about all of us um was just this

939
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:40,079
idea that there were uh there was not

940
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,839
only recruitment at hospitals but also

941
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,399
within the community and that was part

942
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,280
of how they made sure that their

943
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,440
participants were as representative as

944
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,359
possible um and then the other thing was

945
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,720
that this could be done a lot of it can

946
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,800
be done online so whether you were at

947
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,960
home or at one of these centers you

948
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,400
could go online create an account give

949
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,960
your informed consent uh contribute all

950
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
the data again you didn't have to sit in

951
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,359
someone else's room you could sit at

952
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,920
home and contribute all this data um you

953
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,200
would then go into your appointment

954
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,880
which I think I'll show you on the next

955
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,680
slide um and you can also uh view your

956
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,680
own data and results from that

957
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,680
too uh this is an example from the UK

958
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,520
biobank this was a little older this was

959
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,480
from 2007 I couldn't find their more

960
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,200
upto-date

961
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,200
protocols um but they specifically said

962
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,560
that they aim in their in everything

963
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,160
they did with bios samples was to

964
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,400
maximize scientific return within

965
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,960
budgetary limits um which I think is

966
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,079
kind of what all of us try to do all the

967
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,040
time um but they took 45 MLS of blood uh

968
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,200
from their participants and then they

969
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,920
separately processed plasma serum white

970
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,240
blood cells and red blood cells so that

971
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,400
those four sample types were available

972
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,920
uh and

973
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,680
so uh they also took 9 MLS of urine in

974
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,240
their protocol they talk about why they

975
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,880
they considered a lot of other things

976
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,720
right so and this here which I liked was

977
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,920
some of their reasons why they

978
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,920
considered um some sample types but then

979
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,359
excluded them and so you know hair

980
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,200
people think a lot about longer term

981
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,839
environmental exposures with hair but

982
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,240
they just didn't know how to get it Tu

983
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,200
like it just seemed like the processing

984
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,480
was higher than the the benefits at that

985
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,280
time um saliva they weren't choosing

986
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,640
then there are some salivary biomarkers

987
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,800
I think now we feel differently about

988
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,800
that knowing how much better our

989
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,640
sequencing has gotten um and so you know

990
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,040
it I it's also nice that these protocols

991
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,079
will often have some of that why so even

992
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,000
if you're thinking about starting your

993
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,720
own you can see how other um other

994
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,839
institutions made their

995
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,160
decisions and this was that all of us

996
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,960
study visit that I was telling you about

997
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,839
um and so there was all of that

998
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,760
participant provided information which

999
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:48,119
again that part could be at home and so

1000
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,160
if you because we often think about like

1001
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,160
what's the burden of participation and

1002
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,800
definitely the time spent at a visit is

1003
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,680
a high burden we're often in places

1004
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,000
where you have to find parking someone's

1005
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,160
had to be with the rest of your family

1006
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,680
members

1007
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,920
there's many things that come into an

1008
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,760
in-person visit so reducing that time

1009
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,480
can really increase the ability of

1010
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,040
someone who's interested to participate

1011
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,359
um and so really what they did in person

1012
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,760
was the physical measurements you have

1013
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:13,800
to sit for five minutes it's like the

1014
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
white coat hypertension phenomenon as

1015
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,079
well as if you were rushing there right

1016
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,480
so there was there was the five minutes

1017
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,240
of waiting so that you could get real

1018
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,920
Baseline Vital sign measurements right

1019
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,920
uh because if your heart rate is high

1020
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,400
but it's because you just you know got

1021
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,520
that very last parking spot but it was

1022
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,040
seven blocks away it's different than if

1023
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,480
you have a baseline risk of tacac cardia

1024
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,760
um and so then they would do their their

1025
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,880
measurements and their bio uh bios

1026
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,760
specimen Collections and they very

1027
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,200
specifically were making these visits as

1028
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,800
short as possible in terms of the um the

1029
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,560
interface

1030
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,960
time uh they also had a special

1031
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,520
pediatric protocol and so this is again

1032
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,640
where you think about having a special

1033
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,800
subset where they were actually

1034
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,359
collecting different types of metadata

1035
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,400
and so knowing uh I mean I think we all

1036
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,319
know that there's lifelong impacts of

1037
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,079
early Health exposures uh but sometimes

1038
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:08,760
it can be more useful to have those data

1039
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,760
if your overall participation also

1040
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,720
started early in life so that you can

1041
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,599
track the impact of multiple of those

1042
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,040
different uh exposures and so they had

1043
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,720
very uh specific questions about

1044
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,160
environment about um uh early life

1045
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,680
adversity that they collected as well

1046
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,920
and so that was like a special cohort

1047
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,960
with a larger metadata

1048
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,800
set and so what's our niku biobank uh

1049
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,880
it's a subset of our overall Hospital

1050
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,359
biobank which actually means that we end

1051
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,079
up having like three different versions

1052
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,079
of our consent as I'll show you in a

1053
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,960
minute uh because we try to kind of

1054
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,200
optimize someone's participation to

1055
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,640
maximize their potential benefit from

1056
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:53,400
being involved um similarly to kind of

1057
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,839
lower the the bar of of participation to

1058
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,119
meet where people want to be we have

1059
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,079
many different tiered levels of consent

1060
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,319
so it can just be the excess samples so

1061
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,240
no extra needle pokes you know not even

1062
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:06,040
a saliva swab just whatever is in the

1063
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,599
lab and left over will be

1064
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,960
saved uh we can do a separate blood draw

1065
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,720
so you can have a you know when there's

1066
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,760
going to be a blood draw anyways we can

1067
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,319
take one extra tube and freeze that um

1068
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,480
sometimes parents give us samples we do

1069
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:21,079
a lot of genome sequencing um for people

1070
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,160
who participate in our our study and so

1071
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,079
we'll often get parent saliva is what we

1072
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,880
tend to do now but they can also give a

1073
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,359
directed blood sample if they want um

1074
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,200
and then all of those things are with or

1075
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,880
without genetic studies and so it's

1076
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,280
really that people can choose what's

1077
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,720
right for them and it might change over

1078
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,200
time sometimes people are not initially

1079
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,560
interested in genetic testing but then

1080
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,560
if they're still with us one or two

1081
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,599
months later their their desire for that

1082
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,119
type of information may have switched um

1083
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,880
so we we do kind of check in with

1084
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,000
families as they remain there um one

1085
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,240
sample is stored for free by our biobank

1086
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
with the caveat that I have to share it

1087
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,640
with anyone who wants it which is fine

1088
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,960
because that's why I got them um and any

1089
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,960
additional samples come to our

1090
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:06,920
lab um so first yeah I have a question

1091
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,319
about your previous slide where you said

1092
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,839
that um like over time they might change

1093
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:14,000
the permission do you also have an

1094
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,599
option where they might actually take

1095
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,040
back permission and then how does that

1096
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,839
like actually happen if people have

1097
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,400
already started like working with those

1098
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,960
samples or analyzing it like having to

1099
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,560
backtrack um you have to kind of Mark

1100
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,400
the moment that they with Dre uh consent

1101
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,160
and then you do have to remove all of

1102
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,880
their data from the we remove it from

1103
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,079
the metadata we discard their samples

1104
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,880
appropriately for biohazard uh and then

1105
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,680
we remove all of their data from

1106
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,200
anything you can't remove what's already

1107
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,960
been published right um but you would if

1108
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,400
there's anything that is not yet

1109
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,359
published you would remove their sample

1110
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,800
from

1111
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:55,160
analysis it's one of the reasons to have

1112
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,880
a really good consent right like you

1113
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,040
want people to feel comfortable with

1114
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,720
what they have agreed to and it's

1115
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,119
another reason to have a really good

1116
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,880
deidentification

1117
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:08,599
right uh we recently did uh paper where

1118
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,960
we looked at genetic causes of hypotonia

1119
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,079
in infants um across five continents

1120
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,160
right sounds so fancy um but it really

1121
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,280
meant that we couldn't report anyone's

1122
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,680
variant because though it sounds like

1123
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,200
it's across a big population it was a

1124
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,920
100 people and those variants don't

1125
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,359
exist in Nomad they don't exist anywhere

1126
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,960
right that we know of except for those

1127
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,839
infant sometimes and so it's incredibly

1128
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,480
identifiable uh and so part of it is

1129
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,680
also thinking like what you report and

1130
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,800
though it would be useful to have the

1131
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,560
variants reported for scientific

1132
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,400
progress and that's my inclination is to

1133
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,480
want to do that um we did not in that

1134
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,000
particular case because it was such a

1135
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,720
small number of individuals um so it is

1136
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,359
that that balance and I think always

1137
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,200
making your best decision if you were if

1138
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:55,000
you were a participant knowing the range

1139
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,920
of participant opinions how do you kind

1140
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
of best carry out what they what anyone

1141
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,200
consented to through the entire scope of

1142
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,200
the

1143
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,560
project um yeah so we were luckily

1144
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,319
already at an institution that was

1145
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,119
accredited so we didn't have to do that

1146
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:13,720
part um we did get IRB approval and then

1147
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,560
every time you change something even if

1148
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,480
you're changing your brochure they might

1149
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,720
ask you to change other things too so

1150
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,359
that your entire protocol is up to date

1151
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,240
with current requirements because as you

1152
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,040
know what's what's considered

1153
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,599
appropriate with genetic data is

1154
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,880
constantly changing um and so that's one

1155
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,680
of the things to know is that she'll be

1156
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,680
making lots of edits but it's all so

1157
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,680
that you do the right thing um and

1158
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,000
sometimes it's just lots of back and

1159
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,599
forth um the other thing that goes so

1160
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,359
there's a study protocol there right

1161
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,559
which is like why we're doing it

1162
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,119
inclusion exclusion criteria um kind of

1163
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,440
what uh what someone's what what we're

1164
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,440
going to do as the study team and then

1165
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,240
there's the informed consent which is

1166
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,280
the version of that that is captured but

1167
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,480
for the participants to read you need to

1168
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,960
represent what you're going to do you

1169
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,359
need to represent what your aims are you

1170
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,920
need to represent what the potential

1171
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,520
benefits and uh downsides would be and

1172
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,800
then actually everything up there

1173
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,240
everything goes in the IRB like a

1174
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,960
brochure if you change who's on your

1175
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,240
brochure you need to put a new version

1176
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,559
up there um if you're going to post on

1177
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,160
social media to try to contact

1178
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,720
participants you need to have that on

1179
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,960
your IRB and you need to have your

1180
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,319
posting um on the IRB also and so

1181
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,680
there's a lot of things some of the

1182
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,520
things that you might feel like are just

1183
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,319
automatic after you've gotten your

1184
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,720
approval um are actually still still

1185
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:31,640
looked at uh by the IRB um and then

1186
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,680
there's the things that don't

1187
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,559
necessarily go there but it's the how to

1188
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,160
do things right so it's the standard

1189
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,280
operating procedure that says you know

1190
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,839
Hannah my lovely ra who does all of

1191
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,240
these consents like it's it's how Hannah

1192
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:47,000
does it and when Hannah goes to medical

1193
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,319
school it's she will pass it on to the

1194
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,079
next person to make sure that they do

1195
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,720
the approaches in the same way that they

1196
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,079
consult you know contact interpreter

1197
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,200
services in the same way just so that

1198
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,760
it's consistent year a year and if we

1199
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,800
make changes we try to be very

1200
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,400
purposeful about it uh because small

1201
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,200
changes in how you do things like that

1202
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:11,119
might impact who's recruited and uh and

1203
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:14,000
whatnot um and so why did we do it in

1204
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,720
particular and I'll be I'll be brief um

1205
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,040
is like I mentioned I just think that

1206
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,319
there's a lot of a lot we can learn um

1207
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,319
from our patient population uh it's for

1208
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:25,119
both people inside our group people in

1209
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:26,800
the hospital uh and then external

1210
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,359
collaborations where it might be hard to

1211
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,520
get together you know more than two or

1212
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,359
three people with a particular diagnosis

1213
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,359
at your hospital but if we all work

1214
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,000
together we can actually get a um a

1215
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,480
large group uh a lot of it with all of

1216
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,400
these biobanks is to prepare for

1217
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,040
research right we have these transient

1218
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,319
contact opportunities uh and so we

1219
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,400
wanted to to start that contact UM many

1220
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:51,480
times funders will be glad to provide

1221
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,680
your sequencing if you already have the

1222
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,520
samples having been burned for years by

1223
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,359
people who said oh it's great look at my

1224
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,079
recruitment rate so far I will show up

1225
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,880
with 5 million samples um and then those

1226
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,040
samples never appearing right so people

1227
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,640
often want everything to be in hand when

1228
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,119
you're making your proposal and so this

1229
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,680
is one way of enabling that um there

1230
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,480
these very rare events uh and again I

1231
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,240
think especially for trainees being able

1232
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,319
to kind of maximize their impact in the

1233
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,319
time that they have is good and then

1234
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,160
there's just questions we haven't

1235
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:24,079
anticipated yet um I get new questions

1236
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,680
every time I go to the hospital and so

1237
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,000
being able to kind of have those things

1238
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,800
for the people who not just have the

1239
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,520
question but are then going to act on it

1240
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,640
um is is good and then as mentioned

1241
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,319
sometimes it's just complimenting

1242
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,960
ongoing research so you know uh the

1243
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:42,000
Pediatric heart Network which has always

1244
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:44,040
been a very clinical study oriented uh

1245
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,640
collaborative by the NIH for congenital

1246
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,200
heart disease they didn't used to

1247
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,720
collect bios specimens but now they've

1248
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,400
added to their kind of registry and

1249
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,559
study cohort a bios specimen uh because

1250
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,559
they have tremendous data about patient

1251
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,800
outcomes and exposures and are now able

1252
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:02,480
to genetic risks into that um sometimes

1253
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:08,880
yeah and so that's an example of a a

1254
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:11,319
clinical trial uh and then many times um

1255
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,079
it can be just a useful a useful tool to

1256
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:14,800
complement other kinds of bioinformatic

1257
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,720
projects that are going

1258
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,079
on so sorry this is so small but this

1259
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,920
this is our triage in the NICU which is

1260
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,480
basically that if someone we approach

1261
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,800
everyone for participation in research

1262
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,440
um and if there's kind of no no concern

1263
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,760
for an underlying genetic diagnosis

1264
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,119
they're in with RSV bronchiolitis I

1265
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,599
don't think it was their genes that gave

1266
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:37,640
them the virus it was probably they like

1267
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,240
lovely but slobbery two-year-old sibling

1268
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,920
right um we would approach them for the

1269
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,480
biobank participation where we would

1270
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,200
take excess samples or whatever they

1271
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:49,960
would like to consent to um if someone

1272
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,839
came in with um a particularly a

1273
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,800
particular difference on their brain MRI

1274
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,040
that makes us very likely to think that

1275
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,960
it's a a genetic diagnosis um but let's

1276
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,160
say it was five years ago and we only

1277
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,800
did exome sequencing we then would have

1278
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,400
consented them for research genome

1279
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,200
sequencing right um but if they had a

1280
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,240
very specific condition where perhaps

1281
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,280
their genome sequencing now was negative

1282
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,079
but they have a muscular distrophy and

1283
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,520
we think that RNA sequencing is actually

1284
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:18,520
going to be what shows us where the

1285
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,319
pathogenic variant is then we actually

1286
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,119
had them enroll in the man Center where

1287
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,720
there's very prospective and purposeful

1288
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,000
uh testing of things like you know blood

1289
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:31,319
RNA um or doing long read sequencing to

1290
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,640
look for those missing variants and so

1291
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,119
that's where we try to have everyone

1292
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,760
have the maximum benefit from their

1293
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:38,720
participation so if they if it's a if

1294
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,960
it's a diagnosis that the man Center is

1295
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,559
going to go after we have them consent

1296
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,800
there because I think there's potential

1297
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,960
participant benefit um but if Manon

1298
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,359
Center declines then we do our genetic

1299
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,480
testing on a research basis um through

1300
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,720
our

1301
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,480
project um so yeah so we take any baby

1302
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,040
uh we take anything they want to give us

1303
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,200
um and then this was just our example

1304
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,599
project and this is my last slide uh is

1305
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,800
just that there was a fellow who was

1306
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,800
really interested in the immune response

1307
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,040
to viruses and we're one of the only ncu

1308
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,440
in the state that will take babies

1309
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,240
who've been home and babies who have

1310
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,920
known uh infectious diseases right

1311
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,160
that's us niku are usually like only if

1312
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,440
you were born in that hospital do you

1313
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,000
get to enter uh and so we're a unique

1314
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,559
place to get to see babies who have

1315
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,160
severe impact of respiratory illnesses

1316
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,079
and so the fellow was able to use our

1317
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,760
existing IRB uh we've been able to

1318
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,000
collect the swabs that she would like

1319
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,119
and store them in the lab um and that

1320
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,079
probably saved her like a year of

1321
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:39,079
regulatory applications um so that was

1322
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,480
nice so uh I think biobanks are an

1323
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,480
important piece of our biomedical

1324
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,200
research there are some ex Exemplar ones

1325
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,480
that have really transparent policies if

1326
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,599
you're ever thinking of starting one or

1327
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,960
just want to know more about how they

1328
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,640
tick they have lovely documentation and

1329
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,240
sometimes small local bio Banks might

1330
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,160
still be useful for the particular

1331
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,240
question that you're you're looking in

1332
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,760
and whether this is a um you know a

1333
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,920
Community Foundation that has made their

1334
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,079
own registry and now has biobanks

1335
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:08,200
biobank samples or whether it's at a a

1336
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:10,599
hospital they could be nice resources so

1337
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,599
thanks so

1338
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,680
much thank you so much if we have some

1339
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,680
quick questions just walk up to the

1340
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,119
microphone thank you thank you for the

1341
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,559
talk um given that these biobanks are

1342
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,960
meant to last forever um how do you kind

1343
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:33,400
of achieve the financial stability or

1344
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:36,000
health of the biobanks yeah I think the

1345
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:39,119
big ones do it as we saw right UK

1346
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,040
biobank used to be um a application to

1347
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,839
access and now there's fee for Access

1348
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,760
right and so I think a lot of how people

1349
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:51,119
are becoming sustainable is um using fee

1350
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,319
for access to you know keep those lovely

1351
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,079
uh automated machines going I think a

1352
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:58,160
lot of biobanks are also partnering with

1353
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,319
groups who pay for access to the data on

1354
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,920
large scales right so if you're someone

1355
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,319
who has a commercial interest in a

1356
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,400
particular Gene um being able to have

1357
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,599
access to you know do the proteomics to

1358
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,079
go along with all the diagnosis I think

1359
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:14,680
we've seen Partnerships like that right

1360
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:17,240
like regeneron um uh has has you know

1361
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,920
many ways in which they're able to

1362
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,760
commoditize the data from their

1363
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,400
sequencing cohort and bios specimens uh

1364
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,280
to be able to make it sustainable um but

1365
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,160
fundamentally there's no

1366
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,000
you know like you could imagine any of

1367
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,480
them collapsing and then it would just

1368
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,559
be up to the community to find someone

1369
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,160
who would be able to kind of take over

1370
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,000
the the specimens that have value um I

1371
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,839
think much of the

1372
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,480
data right because there's the data

1373
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,559
infrastructure and there's the the um

1374
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,720
biological specimens infrastructure and

1375
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,920
in some ways those are able to be

1376
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,200
separated too um but it does seem that

1377
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,480
in our current climate that there might

1378
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,480
be some some changes either in requiring

1379
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,720
access to do many of the experiments or

1380
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,200
paid access to do many of the

1381
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,160
experiments that we used to do um for

1382
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,839
lower no cost um or some of them not

1383
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,760
being sustainable like even at our

1384
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:13,599
Hospital right we we downsized all of

1385
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,440
our samples pretty significantly um to

1386
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,599
be able to keep just the highest yield

1387
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,960
ones great thank you so much that was

1388
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,280
wonderful um and I think we'll stop

1389
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,280
there for time thanks everyone thanks

1390
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,280
