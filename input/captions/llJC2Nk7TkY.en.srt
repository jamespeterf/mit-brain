00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,200
Hi, I'm Dr. Christopher Dennis Cole,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,960
founder and CEO of Da Vinciables. I

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,280
created this company after leading

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,040
sensing and systems teams at Whimo and

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Apple and completing my MBA at MIT. Our

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,520
mission is to transform female health

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,240
through AI powered insights personalized

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,720
for the female body. We're an MIT Delta

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,199
V Techar Sports and Harvard V partner

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,920
venture. And our team essentially brings

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,920
together deep expertise in AI,

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,000
wearables, women's health, and go to

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,760
market strategy. We've secured four

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,399
patents and completed top tier

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,239
accelerators at MIT and techars. We work

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
closely with Harvard, Bringham, and

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,480
other medical experts to ensure our

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480
platform is both clinically aligned and

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
user centric. We're essentially

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,360
empowering personalized female health

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
through wearable AI. And this is because

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
women's health has been underserved for

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
far too long. Existing wearables are

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
generic and don't address the unique

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
female physiology such as menstrual

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
cycles, hormone fluctuations, and

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
uterine health. This gap, as you might

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,439
imagine, leaves female athletes and

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
professionals without tools to manage

30
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,640
energy, mood, injury risk, and chronic

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,520
conditions. In fact, half of the

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,520
population aged 18 to 34 already live

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,159
with a chronic condition. And the lack

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,720
of tailored tools exacerbates outcomes

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,360
across life stages. Major brands like

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,759
Nike acknowledge that 45% of teenage

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,600
girls drop out of sports due to these

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,280
challenges and corporate wellness

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,400
offerings today simply aren't

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,040
personalized for women. Which is why Da

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
Vinci has a patented AI platform

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
delivering personalized insights for the

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
female body. We integrate biomarker data

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,119
from wearables such as watches, rings,

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
and our own smart active wear with

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,439
proprietary algorithms to generate

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,600
real-time adaptive recommendations.

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
Essentially, when to train, what to eat,

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,840
how to optimize performance across

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,640
hormonal phases. Think of it as an AI

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,560
coach for every woman's physiology. For

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,479
corporates, Da Vinci provides a plug-in

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
wellness solution that addresses the

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
massive blind spot in women's health

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,119
offerings, enhancing employee wellness,

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,959
reducing chronic condition risks, and

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,280
driving better health outcomes across

58
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,840
the female workforce.

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,080
Our platform delivers insights through a

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,000
simple mobile app interface. For

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,000
example, women receive phase-based

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,680
guidance. Again, how to train smarter,

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,239
which foods to prioritize to manage

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,319
fatigue, how to adjust sleep routines,

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,560
and how to understand mood and energy

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,080
across your hormonal cycles. This will

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
help women optimize both their

68
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,319
professional and personal wellness,

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,760
bringing true personalization to

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,400
corporate health programs.

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,560
We also have a body API married to a

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
female bio intelligence large language

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
model agent. And what that's doing is

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,040
it's analyzing biioarker and wellness

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,360
data to assess health injury risk and

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,519
optimize performance. So let me walk you

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,400
through the flow. User data is retrieved

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,480
and contextualized. Our LLM with rag

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
generates personalized insights. And

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,920
three, the system integrates external

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
data sets and models for continuous

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,599
learning and adaptive recommendations.

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,239
Essentially, it's personalized and

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,000
adapted to you as the individual instead

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
of operating on the law of averages like

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
many systems. So, this allows us to

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,800
deliver precise and actionable guidance

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
helping women manage their health

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
performance both in sport and in daily

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
life.

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
We've validated Da Vinci with over a

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,440
thousand user interviews and pilots

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,440
across three universities. Athletes use

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,519
Da Vinci to optimize training among

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
menstrual around menstrual phases,

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,920
reducing injury risk, and improving

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
performance. And we're also launching

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
with corporate partners to enhance

99
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,920
employee wellness programs, providing

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,200
actionable insights for women balancing

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,200
work, health, and family life. Our

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
champions network of pro and collegiic

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,879
athletes helps to drive grassroots

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,799
adoption and awareness as well.

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,560
So, what are we seeking? We would love

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,360
