2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,960
uh to start the Forum uh it would be

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,599
great if each of you uh could take a few

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,759
minutes to provide an overview of your

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,760
libraries experience uh leaving a big

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,119
deal um you know which deals did you

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,840
leave what were your driving motivations

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,800
and what has the outcome been um so far

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,000
just a brief uh overview I know we'll

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,199
dive into this more in detail followup

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,599
questions but perhaps we you know could

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,439
start in the order of introductions um

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,439
an if you could kick us

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,800
off sure I have to do the dreaded unmute

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,239
so here I am I remember to unmute and

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,480
Lang Yukon library before I dive in I

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,840
want to give a huge shout out to all of

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,120
my colleagues at Yukon library who did

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,800
incredible work uh carrying out my idea

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,960
to save us a whole lot of money and also

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,399
all of our faculty and administrative

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,480
Partners at the University who also were

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,199
incredible supporters and had Amazing

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Ideas so shout out to all of them so the

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,600
the reason we uh unbundled all of our

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,960
big deals at Yukon over the course of

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,479
we're actually in our final year and a

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,720
half um is really about budget so budget

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,119
drove all of our decisions to do this we

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,040
Yukon as many people know has lots of

31
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:28,000
budgetary issues over the years uh We've

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,360
cut a lot of f a lot of Staff positions

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,520
all kinds of stuff but in 2019 December

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,399
of 2019 we were looking at serious two

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,560
and a half three million cuts to our

36
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:44,159
budget and I could no longer take it in

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,159
staff we'd gone from 166 staff in 2012

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,119
to 100 in 2018 when I got there and

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,880
there was just no wiggle room um and so

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,600
really thinking hard about this and

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,360
having experienced Journal cancellations

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,320
from the beginning of my career in 1996

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,039
at multiple institutions I was ready to

44
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,160
just say we're done we're getting out we

45
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,760
have we have the software technology to

46
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,400
make it easy for people we'll figure it

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,720
out let's come up with a plan let's not

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,599
break any contracts when they come up

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,560
for Renewal we'll just end them and uh

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,560
so that was our plan so we had to cut

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,080
between two and a half and $3 million

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,280
from our collections budget and I didn't

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,560
want to do the Death By A Thousand Cuts

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,200
so it was like let's just do it let's do

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,959
it um and then uh so we did we we had a

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,519
CP you'll hear a lot about this later

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,879
but we had internal external groups that

58
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,599
worked on it we got University

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,159
Administration involved um and we also

60
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,920
our goal was really save money save time

61
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:58,200
get people what they need that was

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:01,360
really our Focus um and uh right now um

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,760
we are down to about about we had a $4.5

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,599
million ejournal spend and we're down to

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:12,920
about 2 million now by 2025 we'll be at

66
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:16,120
1.5 and we're spending between 150 and

67
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,319
300K providing articles on demand so

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,200
that's a huge difference and people are

69
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,440
getting what they need when they need it

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,360
super fast um I think the hardest part

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,280
to to do something like this is PR you

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,959
have to pay attention to PR the rest of

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,360
it libr Ians can figure anything out but

74
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,799
if you don't have your PR in place your

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,760
communication plan in place your admin

76
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,879
in place it's not going to happen well

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,519
um and I think that that role of the

78
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,120
University Administration is key and I'm

79
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,920
going to stop there because I think I

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,599
answered all the questions you wanted me

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,439
to

82
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,400
cover thanks so much an uh P if you'd

83
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,360
like to go

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,519
next thanks Nick and thanks for hosting

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,720
this uh important conversation so I'm uh

86
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,920
Pari I'm the vice president for library

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,120
and information technology here at bnal

88
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,760
um so at bakal um we are a merged uh

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,640
libran an IT organization so I lead both

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,000
those

91
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,359
teams and I've been here for um about in

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,320
my 17th year um in this

93
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,960
role so just as a backdrop about

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,560
um why we all here today so we actually

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,240
started this conversation in the fall of

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,000
2019 with a faculty governance

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,080
group and and it kind of came about as

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,320
we I was developing a fiveyear

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,720
projection of what a budgets are because

100
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,600
our budgets were staying flat we were

101
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,280
not

102
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,960
getting um any uh additional funds uh

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,759
and that was University wide I mean the

104
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,240
library was not singled out I mean no

105
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
everybody was kind of had to deal with a

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,120
flat budget so as we were kind of making

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,280
these projection I just had to share

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,919
that one chart with the faculty

109
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,759
governance group saying this is what the

110
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,919
deficit looks like in the next 5 years

111
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,960
if we don't start taking action

112
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,560
now and looking back I think that was

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,960
the single

114
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,720
most piece of information that kind of

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
got this conversation started and they

116
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,840
looked at it like okay now what are we

117
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,440
going to

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,759
do and for us um when we kind of started

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,080
this conversation it was not about

120
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,759
cutting budget cutting

121
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,759
budgets it was about really um

122
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,880
sustainability and and that's the way we

123
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,000
kind of frame the convers ass on

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,600
campus and the task force that we formed

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,520
we called it the collection development

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
sustainability Task Force and and we

127
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,160
were really intentional about not

128
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,120
focusing so much on on the budget but

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,840
about the experience um so we here have

130
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,160
a little over 400 faculty at Bak

131
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:56,680
now and what we were finding was every

132
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,800
year um we H we H H anywhere from 40 to

133
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,120
60 faculty I mean not they are not all

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,840
new lines but a lot of visiting faculty

135
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,080
that are coming in filling in for

136
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,759
sabatical or

137
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,599
um uh folks who are leave and obviously

138
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,039
they they're here for a year or two and

139
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,160
we had no room in our budget to kind of

140
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,080
take into account any new programs that

141
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,400
we were starting any new faculty

142
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,319
requests that any new courses because

143
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,080
like well there's no money in the budget

144
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,800
to do any of those things so I think we

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,400
we kind of really looked at how do we

146
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,440
kind of sustain and look at things

147
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,400
5 10 15 years out um and and how do we

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,520
kind of form that

149
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,319
experience uh another example was in

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,240
2017 we we launched a brand new College

151
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,039
of

152
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,840
Management but we have nothing in the

153
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,639
library that could support that new

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,639
College to and and and so we um kind of

155
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,440
really stepped back and looked at okay

156
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,240
we need a different model on how we do

157
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:02,280
this so we started looking at

158
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,639
um uh really kind of working with a a

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:09,240
really fantastic faculty committee that

160
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,039
we have uh it's called Clea and U uh the

161
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,080
academic Administration the proos the

162
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,639
college

163
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,919
Deans

164
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:21,400
and like I mentioned so we've I formed a

165
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:24,720
a a task force which included Librarians

166
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,960
um and also since we a merged

167
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
organization I actually had my IT

168
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
project manager lead this project

169
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,599
because we needed strong strong project

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,199
management in this and so she was a real

171
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,160
champion of not just project management

172
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,080
but also managing the change on campus

173
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,800
so the two most important things we

174
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,599
learned through this process was change

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,759
management and project management I

176
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,440
think everything else kind of if you

177
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,400
have those foundations everything else

178
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,360
kind of falls into

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,039
place uh and we start this actually

180
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,759
process believe it or not in the spring

181
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,759
of 2020 uh as the world was shutting

182
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,599
down but we kind of continue to keep our

183
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,159
going and we had faculty U

184
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:11,199
representation on our on our task

185
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,080
force and it was kind of really um

186
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,520
meeting with all different groups

187
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,560
answering questions because there so

188
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,879
much um misconception about what we were

189
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,879
doing oh this is about you're cutting

190
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,280
things uh I'm not going to have access

191
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,800
to what I need so once we kind of

192
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,240
addressed all those questions I think

193
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,159
the conversation really changed I mean I

194
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,640
remember going to um a a meeting of the

195
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,200
of the uh Department chairs for the

196
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,000
College of Arts and Sciences there about

197
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,360
45 of those and after we presented what

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,320
we were doing actually people started

199
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:50,519
clapping yes we all behind you and and

200
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,240
why we doing this and and so um and one

201
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,160
of the things I said early on which

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
really kind of made a difference was we

203
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,600
are not taking access

204
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,079
away you're still going to have access

205
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,480
to what you have today and you'll have

206
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,959
access to more things you we don't have

207
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,360
access to today because we don't have

208
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,279
the resources to get them and you might

209
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,920
not have immediate access but you'll

210
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:16,240
have it in a in a short time frame I

211
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,000
think kind of really um debunking some

212
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
of those myths that people have about

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,959
when you say you're taking something

214
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,079
away I think that really shifted the

215
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:29,120
conversation and then got the faculty by

216
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:30,760
and and um and I think you probably read

217
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,880
in the in in the in the write up that

218
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,279
spark did we when we kind of made the

219
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,399
change in January um of 23 I was

220
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,800
expecting like my email box is going to

221
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,560
blow up it's been over two years and I

222
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,519
haven't received a single email from any

223
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,680
faculty member saying what what we did

224
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,279
was not

225
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,279
right I'll stop

226
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,959
there the great note to end on uh

227
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,839
already seeing themes emerging um yeah

228
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,600
Stephanie I'd like to go next

229
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:06,399
yes for us uh the the whole Adventure

230
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,000
was driven by a large budget guts uh on

231
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,640
our acquisition budget uh the cut was of

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
$1.75

233
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,600
million uh out of an acquisition budget

234
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,000
of 10 million at that time so and it's

235
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:24,320
10 years ago it's a long story it goes

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,480
back in time uh so it forced us to

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,959
consider drastic drastic measures uh so

238
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,320
we decided to attack to those very heavy

239
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:36,160
piece of our budget the big the big

240
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,839
deals um we began our first unbundling

241
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,560
uh of Wy uh only because uh it was the

242
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,639
next to be re renewed uh and we did an

243
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,800
analysis of W's title inspired by the

244
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,760
California Digital Library methodology

245
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,279
at that time TW 10 years 10 years ago

246
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,120
and and we we we broke the first deal

247
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,120
but we soon received very thoughtful

248
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,800
comments from our work Comm

249
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,959
not not about the the idea of missing

250
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,639
title but about the

251
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,519
methodology that was the the the main

252
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,839
focus um they were supportive of of big

253
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,839
deals on on bundling idea so what we did

254
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,880
is to to gather a task force of those

255
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,000
faculty that have been the more critics

256
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,240
of our

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,240
methodology uh there were faculty

258
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,240
members students uh and we we created

259
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,839
group that group to improve the

260
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,800
methodology and we had the help of a a

261
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,279
library school and bibliometric uh

262
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,360
teacher V arier who now holds the new uh

263
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,360
UNESCO chair of open science so it was

264
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,839
pretty strong committee it was really

265
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,279
interesting to hear them think think

266
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,160
about the methodology so they did

267
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,800
recommendation and I may talk about

268
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,160
those recommendation later to enhance

269
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,600
and adapt the methodology and we built a

270
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,480
powerful analytical Tool uh with where

271
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,720
we could find usage stats citation

272
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,839
results of a survey that we did

273
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,519
availability through of of those sources

274
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:16,839
through uh OA uh sources or or archive

275
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:19,639
that we have B uh so at the end uh uh we

276
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:23,440
ident out of a total collection of

277
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:26,600
50,000 uh journals we identified

278
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,279
five thousand titles that were really

279
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,800
essential for our community so 10% only

280
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,000
and it really gives us a interesting

281
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,440
idea of where we we add to with with

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,040
which uh um commercial publisher we had

283
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,519
to focus uh and then we established a

284
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:52,040
formula um uh to identify the fair price

285
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,079
we were going to uh uh attribute to each

286
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,519
of the big deals so it was the amount

287
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,320
that we were going to to be that was

288
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,000
going to be available to each of the

289
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,199
negotiations so at the end to to be

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,399
rapid at the end we unbundled um Wy

291
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:12,120
Springer Taylor and

292
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,639
Francis uh and uh we only do did a title

293
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,480
by title with them for some essential

294
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,839
title and for all I would say all the

295
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,160
other big deals and small deals we

296
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,279
renegotiated everything with the

297
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,240
methodology with the results with the

298
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,120
Dem mind of this fair price we

299
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,839
attributed to each of the the the sour

300
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,320
sources so it was really

301
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:40,320
intensive for our acquisition team but

302
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,800
we have been able to uh to to to have to

303
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,399
to reach the amount of of budget cuts

304
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,399
that we had to do I will say

305
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,839
there wonderful uh thank you m so much

306
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,000
Stephanie and uh uh Chris if you want to

307
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,000
go next for for MIT to round us out yeah

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,120
thanks so much and and thanks to to

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,199
sparkk and acrl for hosting this and and

310
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,800
uh it's really great to hear other

311
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,759
people's experience and I really

312
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,360
appreciate uh Ann and others who who who

313
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:16,680
kind of lead with local context matters

314
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,600
so much and um uh yeah I'm really struck

315
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,079
a new by that our local context at MIT

316
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,759
oh I'm Chris Berg I'm the director of

317
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,920
libraries at MIT um our local context at

318
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:31,600
MIT is different in a lot of ways um one

319
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:35,320
particular way uh that sort of is

320
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,519
um uh sort of an overarching theme that

321
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,440
impacts the story that that I'm going to

322
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,720
tell today is um that MIT is a place

323
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,920
that has as an institution has a long

324
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,959
history of supporting open and having

325
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,120
openness as like a core part of the

326
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,759
culture like you know we are one of the

327
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,240
birthplaces of Open Source software open

328
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,920
course whereare you know started 20 some

329
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,639
odd years ago one of the first all

330
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,279
campus OA polic IES in the US so like

331
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,199
long long history of open that is really

332
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,959
a part of the culture um so so the story

333
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,199
that I want to talk about for us is very

334
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:17,360
specific to our decision in June 2020 to

335
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,880
to cease negotiations with ele and since

336
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,399
June of 2020 we have had no journals

337
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,600
contract with

338
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,440
ele so that's it's not an un we've

339
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,839
unbundled some other things we've you

340
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,680
know tried to avoid big deals for quite

341
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,680
some time um up until June 2020 we had a

342
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,519
TI already had a titleby tile deal with

343
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,279
El and in June 2020 after trying very

344
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,880
hard to negotiate with them uh we're not

345
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,720
able to reach an agreement um and walked

346
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,120
away that was prompted not by budget

347
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,560
considerations again another really

348
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,720
difference here um it was prompted by um

349
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,880
a set of

350
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,839
principles that grew out of a process

351
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,839
that was several years long so and and

352
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,319
I'm not even going to tell the whole

353
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
story because that'll take too long but

354
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,880
let's start in 2019 in

355
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,279
2019 uh a group uh an Institute Wide

356
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,079
Open Access task force um released a set

357
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,240
of recommendations one of which was that

358
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:25,120
the that MIT should develop a set of

359
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,279
principles to be ratified by The Faculty

360
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,160
about open scholarship now it turns out

361
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,199
ratifying a set of principles at The

362
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,000
Faculty level I don't know how that

363
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:37,360
would work on your campus it's really

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,079
hard and we never got around to that TR

365
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,839
true story but we did in the committee

366
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,279
on the libraries decide to take that to

367
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,480
a very specific level and develop what a

368
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,920
set of principles for negotiating with

369
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,600
commercial Publishers and that's the MIT

370
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,120
framework that many of you endorsed at

371
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,720
the time thank you very much and may

372
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,040
well be uh familiar with um and that

373
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,760
that set of

374
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,720
principles um you know

375
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,600
many sort of grounded in this idea that

376
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,360
uh a principle that authors should not

377
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,679
have to give up rights to their own work

378
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,439
authors should not have to wave their

379
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,760
own institutions policies or funer

380
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,160
policies in order to publish right so

381
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,319
there were some real very clear

382
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,760
principles in that framework um uh that

383
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,000
supported

384
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,960
you know a move towards more openness um

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,360
in scholar Communications and for the

386
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,160
Publications coming out of MIT and we

387
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,840
started there again wasn't about budget

388
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,600
for us um it was about the fact that

389
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,080
again there's there was there was a

390
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,760
fairly widespread consensus across

391
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,400
campus that open is

392
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,559
good um we had an open access policy and

393
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,360
and a a task force that was tasked with

394
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,000
you know coming up with recommendations

395
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,919
about how we could be even more open

396
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,760
right and so so the framework and then

397
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:15,080
the that being the lever to walk away

398
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:21,240
from ele was about where does the where

399
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:24,039
does the Institute have um uh an a lever

400
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,200
with Publishers to make a difference

401
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:31,520
that isn't scholar by scholar like the

402
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,360
only place that MIT is at the table with

403
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,000
the Publishers is through the

404
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,400
library and so in addition you know

405
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,280
instead of or in addition to negotiating

406
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,799
prices for reading that's where we can

407
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,640
start to talk about principles for

408
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:50,240
publication as well and so that's so

409
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,039
okay long story short and I the the

410
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,520
other questions will get there but it

411
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:57,039
was a year long yearslong process of

412
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
developing these principles in

413
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,200
collaborate close collaboration with

414
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,400
faculty and others socializing those

415
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,799
principles getting buy in for those

416
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,840
principles uh collecting allies and

417
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,760
building Coalition across campus and

418
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,440
support of the uh the institution so

419
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,799
that by the time we got to the point

420
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,000
where it was clear that El was not going

421
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,720
to offer a contract that met the

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,159
principles all I had to do I mean all I

423
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,080
had to do at that point we just had to

424
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,400
say look they wouldn't they wouldn't

425
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,919
meet these principles and here where

426
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,280
they fell short

427
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,640
and you know I had faculty and and

428
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,120
leaders Across The Institute said well

429
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,799
you got to stick to your

430
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,159
principles so that's our story it's a

431
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,840
little different but a lot of

432
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:45,840
similarities as well and and like

433
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,919
an uh you know ain's here to keep me

434
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,840
honest and to fill in some details at

435
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,840
certain points um but truly there were

436
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,120
so many people across the libraries and

437
00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:00,039
across MIT put in years of work lots and

438
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,960
lots of work and frankly um who who uh

439
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,280
it displayed a significant amount of

440
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,520
Bravery in taking this stance and so big

441
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,080
shout out to that to to everyone across

442
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,760
the libraries and The Institute who who

443
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,760
helped make this

444
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,000
happen thanks so much for those uh those

445
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,840
intros and on sort of that note of

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,559
appreciation too it was really an

447
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,320
impossible you know sort of choice on

448
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,679
like who to profile like what order you

449
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,640
sort of U you who to have join these

450
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,520
panels I mean I think we need to be

451
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,120
doing more of these but you I just want

452
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,120
to flag the cancellation tracker that I

453
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,520
mentioned at the top um you just also by

454
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,360
way of recognizing the other

455
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,159
institutions that have you sort of put

456
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,440
in the the difficult work here and also

457
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,000
have really valuable experiences to to

458
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,840
share so you know we'll uh dive into you

459
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,640
sort of a discussion with this panel but

460
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,440
just wanted to at the top make sure to

461
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,440
highlight you know the many many other

462
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,000
institutions many of whom are probably

463
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,799
here in the room um you that have this

464
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,360
kind of experience and have done this

465
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,159
this important um and sometimes

466
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,559
challenging work you know so already uh

467
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,240
sort of the theme of Faculty reactions

468
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,279
uh has come uh to the Forefront you know

469
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,600
pretty unsurprising uh I think but you

470
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:19,120
know speaking with many libraries there

471
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,559
are negotiations Community practiced uh

472
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,720
that are considering these moves or you

473
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,440
speaking to them before um they made the

474
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,640
decision to leave a deal or unbundle um

475
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,559
you the the reaction of faculty

476
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,640
potential reaction to a change like this

477
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:37,840
you frequently come up as you a barrier

478
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,440
uh for even proceeding um down down this

479
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,760
path uh you and I think and since Yukon

480
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,320
uh you know and now it's plans not just

481
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,480
to leave one or even a couple or a few

482
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,840
big deals but to systematically unbundle

483
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,279
from all of them uh uh I think it' be

484
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,120
great to start with you just to hear a

485
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,760
little bit more about um you know what

486
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,600
you've already started to share about

487
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,159
you sort of faculty's reaction to this

488
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,559
systematic move um you and sort of how

489
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,840
you got

490
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,799
there absolutely so um let me pull up my

491
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,720
notes here um as I said in my intro the

492
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,360
hardest piece is PR getting Buy in

493
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,799
getting people to understand what's

494
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,440
actually going on and I think that that

495
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,400
once you gain the support of

496
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,880
administration and I think it really

497
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,159
helps if you also include them in the

498
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,559
work that you do for example we had an

499
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,840
internal uh group that looked at the

500
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,400
Logistics but then an external group of

501
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,440
40 faculty who we pulled together the

502
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,880
Provost and I were co-hosts of this it

503
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,640
was called future of journals and we met

504
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:46,559
this was during um uh from December 2021

505
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,880
through March of 2021 um for like

506
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,320
multiple weeks maybe nine weeks once a

507
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,919
week we met and we had a a Google doc

508
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,840
where we just answered questions added

509
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,039
questions expanded on them in the

510
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,880
meetings but we had what I would call

511
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:03,039
Four Champions faculty champions from

512
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,640
across the University from Health

513
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:11,360
Sciences to uh to Medieval studies um

514
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,440
every single field and um we asked we

515
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,960
also had some post dos in the room and

516
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,799
all of my senior leadership team were ex

517
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,000
officios as well as our head of

518
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,760
Acquisitions and basically what we did

519
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,120
was we educated all of them about the

520
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,039
situation and then we asked them what

521
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,080
would be the parameters to make this

522
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,720
work for you and they basically came up

523
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,840
with two easy to find quick return that

524
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,279
was all they cared about if they could

525
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,520
find it easily through their own

526
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,200
Discovery that we already had in place

527
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,640
Google Scholar any of our databases and

528
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,320
they could get it within three minutes

529
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,120
they were fine with it and then at the

530
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,480
end of all of that after we' answered

531
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,640
all of their questions over those months

532
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,600
we held a vote can we do this project

533
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,320
and it was unanimous unanimous no

534
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,559
questions because we'd spent all that

535
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,080
time educating them hearing from them

536
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,760
teaching them about OA scholly

537
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,000
communication serials crisis every

538
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,320
single thing you could possibly imagine

539
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,880
and why we were doing it to save money

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,200
and one of the most powerful things the

541
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,720
Provo said was we don't have to do this

542
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,720
project but I have to find $4 million to

543
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,080
cut shall we cut your

544
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,000
department and that was a real that was

545
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,039
the Provo said that to the committee and

546
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,159
it was real eye openening like this is a

547
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:34,039
real thing this is going to happen and

548
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,600
so then um that was the hardest part

549
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,000
right but actually it was the easiest

550
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,320
part because we took the time to help

551
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,440
them understand the situation and then

552
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,559
those people became our Champions and

553
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,520
that was amazing so uh long story short

554
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,080
we did all the background work we found

555
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,440
article Galaxy scholar we got used unsub

556
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,799
we you know started on our project we

557
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,840
had open meetings we met with Deans we

558
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,720
met with administrators we met with any

559
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,880
department or school or college that

560
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,320
wanted us to meet with him the provos

561
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,760
got so excited he was demoing the

562
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,880
interaction and things it was like oh my

563
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,559
God the Provost is conducting

564
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,480
bibliographic instruction it was

565
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,480
hilarious but that buy in was phenomenal

566
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,559
right because as people would say why do

567
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,840
you need the provos well I don't choose

568
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,399
my budget the money comes from them I

569
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,960
don't really care what journals we

570
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,720
subscribe to if it all comes down to it

571
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm not using them I know it's my

572
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
responsibility to provide provide them

573
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,120
with people but the limitation is the

574
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,440
budget and it comes from above so they

575
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,480
have to hold themselves

576
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,840
accountable so we also had uh an email

577
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,640
that many people myself our

578
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
Communications person head of

579
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,559
Acquisitions it was I think it was like

580
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,039
journals questions at yukon.edu um that

581
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,720
anyone could ask a question about

582
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:02,480
anything about the process I would say

583
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,760
we averaged one email a week every time

584
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,840
for like three weeks every time we

585
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,360
unbundled from another publisher and

586
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,960
there were only about five faculty of

587
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,520
all 9,000 or however many we have at

588
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,360
Yukon there were five faculty who were

589
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,960
angry as hell that's it five and we just

590
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,159
mostly what we said to them was here are

591
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,080
your colleagues they served on the

592
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,120
committee please talk to them

593
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,440
but also this is the situation we're

594
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,480
spending $400,000 where we used to spend

595
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,279
4 million or whatever the number is and

596
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,880
and it was hard to refute that so it was

597
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:47,159
really only five people because a lot of

598
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,640
times the seamless it was a seamless

599
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,360
switch over uh the dean of The Graduate

600
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,840
School um was talking to me he was

601
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,360
totally behind this process and we had

602
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:02,200
just uh canceled or unbundled from or

603
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,080
uncontracted from sage and uh he was

604
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,000
like so when are when is Sage on the

605
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,799
list and I said oh we did it last year

606
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,480
and he said I didn't even notice most

607
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,880
people and I think I think it was Pam

608
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,039
that said this um or Stephanie most

609
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,159
people didn't even notice that that that

610
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,240
because of the way we designed it it was

611
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,399
just another click on a citation that

612
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,679
you would

613
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,840
discover that would only show up if you

614
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,679
were faculty and so most people didn't

615
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,720
even know notice that we unbundled it

616
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,159
was all behind the scenes they were just

617
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,880
getting what they wanted when they

618
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,520
needed it plus instead of a three minute

619
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,159
turn around 97% of the time in 10

620
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,880
seconds it appears in your email in 10

621
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,440
seconds so how do you argue with that

622
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,279
you can't argue with it so I would say

623
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,720
making sure that you're getting people

624
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,679
what they need you find out the

625
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,960
parameters of what their requirements

626
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,240
are to do their work

627
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,000
well and then make it happen and make

628
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
sure you have talked to all the right

629
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,960
people and you have Champions I'm going

630
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,960
to stop

631
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,120
there amazing Stephanie I know uh

632
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,039
Montreal's experience was similar in a

633
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,360
way just in you know unbundling from a

634
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,559
number of uh deals relatively quick

635
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,200
succession um so one of you could go

636
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,000
next and sort of speaking to that that

637
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,480
faculty reaction component and managing

638
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,960
and preparing for it yes there's a lot

639
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,159
of similarities between the reaction of

640
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,679
my my communities and an's community

641
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,960
and I think it's because of the same

642
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,960
thing we put a lot of energy in our

643
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,320
communication so we we really we uh we

644
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,440
we did all we can to mobilize The

645
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,120
Faculty

646
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,760
students head of departments University

647
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,600
officer we we wrote article to explain

648
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,120
what was happening why the all ecosystem

649
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,760
of of of of scly publication we did

650
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,799
meeting with with departments

651
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,960
presentation we built a

652
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:03,320
website uh we uh we were we explained

653
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,880
them the the oligopolistic situation we

654
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,799
were uh uh facing the the budget uh

655
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,120
situation we were facing and when we

656
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,960
were meeting with a faculty we were

657
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:19,320
always accompanied by V laier so it was

658
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,600
really uh giving a um scientific seal uh

659
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,399
at this administrative uh process so it

660
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,720
was really interesting in bringing the

661
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,760
conversation elsewhere elsewhere and

662
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,320
giving credibility

663
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,720
uh so globally a very good reaction and

664
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,200
I would say support what we were feeling

665
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,279
is they were proud to see our move they

666
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,159
were standing standing up by the

667
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,399
arrogance of Publishers and what it was

668
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,240
really interesting is that some of them

669
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:52,120
have been really active um students um

670
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,960
wrote to uh Springer for example they

671
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,519
wrote a letter to Springer our director

672
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,279
or University president he wrote to the

673
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:04,799
CEO of Wy uh and uh some of the faculty

674
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,799
uh wrote also to commercial Publishers

675
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,320
to to to tell them their intention not

676
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,399
to publish not to translate not to

677
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,720
review not to participate to to any of

678
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:18,919
their publishing process so for us it

679
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,679
was a it was the result of a good

680
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,640
understanding of what we were doing that

681
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:25,919
was and I would say uh when the faculty

682
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,039
were writing to publisher the phone rang

683
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,880
in my my office at that time not

684
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:35,080
necessarily when our principal wrote

685
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,240
so it was interesting so so I would say

686
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,919
a pretty good understanding but a lot of

687
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,919
work in communication plan

688
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,360
so thanks uh so much Stephanie that's

689
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,519
incredible uh about the students writing

690
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,600
uh and also separately just bless people

691
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:58,039
doing the reactions like it's so helpful

692
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,000
uh Chris uh do I know MIT sort of has a

693
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,360
a bit of a different path here that I

694
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,480
hope this will answer one of the first

695
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,720
questions to come in about what's the

696
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
difference between unbundling and going

697
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,279
out of contract right unbundling you

698
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,519
know being you know breaking up a big

699
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,519
deal but you know resubscribe or you

700
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
know breaking up a big deal but

701
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:13,840
resubscribing to maybe a core number of

702
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,000
titles or having some sort of a contract

703
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,120
with the publisher versus you know going

704
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,919
completely out of contract and having no

705
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,679
subscription you know no contract at all

706
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,399
with that that publisher which I know as

707
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,559
you said MIT is done with with El severe

708
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,519
uh which is a bit of a different thing

709
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,159
to M you manage I would imagine um so

710
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,320
it' be great if you could share you sort

711
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,480
of mit's experience and sort of uh

712
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,480
managing faculty's uh reaction and

713
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,360
supporting them through this yeah um so

714
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,000
much to say about this um you know first

715
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,000
the good news the bottom line up front

716
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,080
like we kept track of reactions like

717
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,600
either emails that we got or uh actually

718
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,240
Erin's team did an amazing job together

719
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,320
with our Communications folks of

720
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,440
tracking tweets about our

721
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,480
announcement um yeah so we so we kept

722
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,159
track of the feedback that we were

723
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,760
receiving and in analyzing it here's

724
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,200
bottom line up front 10 to one

725
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,720
positive so that's you know a bit of the

726
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
story that we like to tell um and it's

727
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,000
remained I don't think we've gotten a

728
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,200
negative uh any negative feedback about

729
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,240
being out of contract with ele in well

730
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:26,080
over a year I think um at least nothing

731
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:28,159
that's risen to my level so um and uh

732
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,080
you know some of I I think an point

733
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,320
about PR matters is is so important we

734
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,519
had um both the MIT news team uh you

735
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,960
know folks in the libraries who work on

736
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,360
communication um together with some key

737
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,880
faculty allies and the then um chair of

738
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,799
the faculty committee on the libraries

739
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,080
um we were putting out statements and

740
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,760
news articles right and left about why

741
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,039
we did this um and so that sort of you

742
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,240
know there was an a a way of sort of

743
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,039
going on the offense um and instead of

744
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,679
having to defend ourselves against

745
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:06,559
faculty concerns um and I mean we'll get

746
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,000
to this a little bit later I mean

747
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,000
honestly the the main concerns that we

748
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,279
had were about speed of of um access

749
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,039
because we did have um the deals we had

750
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,039
signed previously with ele all included

751
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,840
Perpetual access so it was just speed of

752
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:28,600
access to new things published from June

753
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,799
2020 afterwards um and I'm going to let

754
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,399
Aaron during another section talk about

755
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,799
how we solved that problem um but I I

756
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,480
wanted like there was one tweet that it

757
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:40,840
always stayed with me so if folks will

758
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,919
let me read it um this was not long

759
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,639
after we had gone out of contract a

760
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,960
graduate student uh at MIT tweeted this

761
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,039
I was mildly annoyed for being paid

762
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,440
paywalled at molecular cell due to MIT

763
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:56,760
cancelling the El severe contract but

764
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,679
then I remembered that I 100% support

765
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,600
this decision by the

766
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,120
libraries I mean you can't ask for

767
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,519
better right

768
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,879
like so and and that was somewhat

769
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,839
typical um and again it was all because

770
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,599
of the faculty and the library staff who

771
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,960
did the hard work of um really you know

772
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,639
educating and

773
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,159
explaining why we why we wanted to stick

774
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,720
by our principles and negotiating a

775
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,560
contract that would allow our authors to

776
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,960
maintain their own rights to their own

777
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,159
work and be able to follow the the

778
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,000
policies that the institution has um

779
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,720
there was there was a real sort of

780
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,280
almost du logic to that if you will

781
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,320
that's not an official

782
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,480
term so anyway can I just jump in for a

783
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,919
second so okay Nick um please just to

784
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,480
add that I think our Mark interest it's

785
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,159
super interesting to listen to you all

786
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,679
because I think our in some ways there's

787
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,000
much similarity and in some ways our

788
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,720
marketing strategy was slightly

789
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,520
different so to this out there as Chris

790
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,160
said because we were taking this sort of

791
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,440
principled argument we act our marketing

792
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,200
strategy also included the fact that we

793
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,920
were taking or not we the libraries but

794
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,640
in not being able to successfully get

795
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,920
elere to move they were losing access to

796
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,640
content right so it was less about

797
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,520
making it you know immediately

798
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,280
accessible it was like we're taking

799
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,800
we're for these reasons you no longer

800
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,119
have access to elare content and we had

801
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,960
to explain that and like an said I would

802
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,079
just Echo that too that we had a we had

803
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,839
some vocal opposition um but it was a

804
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,920
very small number of of people and so I

805
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:40,640
also think like it was hard particularly

806
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,440
when it was happening um and

807
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,599
particularly for our Frontline staff to

808
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,640
to put that in perspective and to

809
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,119
remember it's a very small number of

810
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,880
people with um strong opinions and many

811
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,839
many many other people also were aligned

812
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,720
with that that tweet that that put out

813
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:58,119
that Chris that Chris just read so

814
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,960
thinking a little bit about about how to

815
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:02,400
put the feedback in

816
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,280
perspective um I think was also an

817
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,280
important lesson uh as we went through

818
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,960
this

819
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,680
process I'm G to jump in one other thing

820
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:14,160
the other thing that helped us was um

821
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,839
when we did have a faculty who who had

822
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,319
you know real gripes about it um we were

823
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:21,520
often able to leverage our faculty

824
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:23,359
colleagues who were in their Department

825
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,079
in their discipline who could talk to

826
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,079
them personto person and say I too rely

827
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,599
on these journals and it's also a pain

828
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,440
for me but here's why I support it

829
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,119
instead of just a librarian talking

830
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,359
about principles this was you know we

831
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,680
could get not that there's anything

832
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,960
wrong with that I'm a big fan of

833
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,000
librarians talking about principles um

834
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,520
but but we had some faculty who were

835
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,119
willing to really get in the trenches

836
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,119
and have those

837
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,000
conversations thanks so much Chris and

838
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,920
Aaron and I think you sort of building

839
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,640
on this theme of uh uh you sort of

840
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,359
making this as easy as possible for

841
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,359
faculty you know to navigate the change

842
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,640
and access um par I know that was a

843
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:04,520
Hallmark of bucknell's uh you know

844
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,960
success um you know and sort of your

845
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,000
quick response times for getting faculty

846
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,160
access to articles U you after the

847
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,440
decision um to move away from the big

848
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,000
deal um so it' be great to to round out

849
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,839
the section just by hearing a little bit

850
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,200
more about your experience and sort of

851
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:21,000
giving faculty you know confidence that

852
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,280
you know they weren't losing access it

853
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,079
was just going to be arranged in a

854
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,800
different way or even to what you said

855
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,640
they might actually be gaining access to

856
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,319
more materials than they had otherwise

857
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,160
yeah so I I think um a lot of my

858
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,599
colleagues touched on this but I think

859
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,520
the one of the important things that we

860
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,599
always need to keep in mind is always

861
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,440
answer the question

862
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,960
why because a lot of times we kind of go

863
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,480
to the end result without kind of

864
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,240
defining the process and and and and the

865
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,000
why so in our case that was kind of the

866
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:56,200
most uh the Hallmark of why we doing

867
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,960
this was front and center of every

868
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,000
conversation um

869
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,760
the other thing that I uh said in in U a

870
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,560
job when we I formed the collection

871
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,640
development task force committee um one

872
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,599
of the first things I said at the

873
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
meeting

874
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,200
was we need to make sure we're not doing

875
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,200
this to faculty but we're doing it with

876
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:19,920
faculty and um and I think that was

877
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,240
important because we made them part of

878
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,160
the

879
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,920
process and if they felt it and and and

880
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,599
this happened uh over a year and and and

881
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,160
at every conversation they we could have

882
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,680
listened to them uh a chair of our

883
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,480
faculty committee presented at faculty

884
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,440
meetings and he was the one who was

885
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,480
presenting not me so faculty we hearing

886
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,079
from faculty but what was going on or

887
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,680
just giving an update of where we were

888
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,839
in the process so so it wasn't that we

889
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,000
announced it and then we did it a lot of

890
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,640
things were happening we held uh open

891
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,560
houses in the library uh we were on the

892
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,839
agenda for the faculty meetings we we

893
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,760
attended um uh the college meetings uh

894
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,680
Department chairs meetings so we have we

895
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,200
had a whole change management plan in

896
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,720
place as to how we can kind of address

897
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:14,040
this um and I think that really kind of

898
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,280
helped at the end of the day it it um I

899
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,599
mean I joke around now but we were all

900
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,079
nervous about the day this change happen

901
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,640
what's going to happen and it was a

902
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,400
non-event and and it was a nonevent

903
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,440
because of all the things we had been

904
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,800
doing for the past year

905
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,960
um and U so I think that's kind of an

906
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,440
important perspective to keep in mind is

907
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,160
because a lot of times we kind of want

908
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,160
to get to the end result but kind of

909
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:48,079
neglect the process and and and the

910
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:51,200
community engagement um in the mix um so

911
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,800
and in our case I think we had a really

912
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,960
strong project manager who was keeping

913
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
us on

914
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,560
track um and and saying okay here are

915
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,400
the things we need to do and um and here

916
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,480
are all the meetings that happen and

917
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,079
here is what we owe to the campus

918
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,680
community on on this St so like we had a

919
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,200
really forward-looking plan in place and

920
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,599
and she kept us on track and if um I

921
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,079
didn't do something she walked into my

922
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,440
office and told me so that I had to hear

923
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,280
the things that I I needed to do so I

924
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:27,800
think that's really uh an important

925
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,359
element um for us in in in the state I

926
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,720
kind of said at the beginning of my

927
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,280
remarks was we were not going to do it

928
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,280
to faculty we're going to do it with

929
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,680
faculty thanks so much and you one

930
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,599
question I just want to pull out right

931
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,440
here um that someone raised was you know

932
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,640
for institutions with subject Librarians

933
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,160
what role did they play um and I just

934
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,720
want to address that quickly before sort

935
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,440
of moving off because I think you know

936
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,400
how different institutions structured

937
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,839
managing faculty reaction doing faculty

938
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,280
Outreach could be really helpful for

939
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:03,720
folks um and so you know we'd love to

940
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,359
just quickly go around and hear you know

941
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,240
for you know any of you all uh any of

942
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,240
for any of the panelists um you know if

943
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,960
subject Librarians were involved you

944
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,319
know or if you know there's anything

945
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,720
that you'd share just about sort of how

946
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,880
this work was structured within the

947
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,000
library

948
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,560
briefly yeah

949
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,560
an so um we use subject Librarians only

950
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:31,280
to share information with their the fol

951
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:35,040
that they liaz with so if they we asked

952
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:38,560
people to um be available to answer

953
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,640
questions but um uh I will say that the

954
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,800
only population that really struggled

955
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,319
with this project was internally in the

956
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,880
library many of them subject Librarians

957
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,880
who just couldn't wrap their brain

958
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,359
around the fact that we weren't doing

959
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,119
Title by title that we weren't giving

960
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,920
faculty an option to weigh in on which

961
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:01,119
titles to um uh to resub subscribed to

962
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,760
or whatever and but we really just gave

963
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,560
them the role of being information

964
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,440
conduits about the project and about the

965
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,000
effect that it would have and we also

966
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,560
asked them to be ambassadors um and that

967
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,800
was mixed it was um that's a very honest

968
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,040
answer but it really was not a

969
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,079
cancellation project and that was hard

970
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,720
for internal people to get their minds

971
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:27,880
around it was just changing the way that

972
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,880
we pay for what people need

973
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,440
mut it had to happen to one of us on uh

974
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,520
this webcast or otherwise it wouldn't be

975
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,559
complete uh yeah thanks an Erin yeah we

976
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,359
formed us a very small committee and and

977
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,520
like par mentioned it was it was the

978
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,599
beginning of the pandemic so pandemic

979
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,280
you know March April May we ended our

980
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:54,400
subscription with elsir in June so we

981
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,200
did not actually have a big complex

982
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,880
project management cycle we were all

983
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,880
running on everybody was running on

984
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,760
fumes so we formed a small committee

985
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,480
that did include um subject uh that

986
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,760
included folks from our our liaison um

987
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,319
area and we um we they're doing much the

988
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,240
same thing sort of in the communication

989
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:16,040
role um we put together talking points

990
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,839
for the layons and we did we've done

991
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,559
that several times um along the way

992
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:23,720
because um we've we've been in a few

993
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,040
waves of negotiations with with El over

994
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,559
the years so you know the reason that we

995
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,920
didn't resubscribe the reason that we

996
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,000
didn't resubscribe you know or re come

997
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,480
come to a transformative agreement um so

998
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,839
we developed some talking points um for

999
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,400
the communication process the um subject

1000
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,400
Librarians um some of them um were

1001
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,119
exceptionally helpful in being the

1002
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,599
mediator and communicating with uh with

1003
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,200
their faculty um which was amazing and

1004
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,280
wonderful some of them needed a little

1005
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,319
bit more support in that you know

1006
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,880
Endeavor and so the scholarly

1007
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,760
Communications team tried to provide

1008
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,480
support in that endeavor and we had a

1009
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,319
sort of an escalation protocol up to

1010
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,680
Chris if you know people were feeling

1011
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,960
like they were not getting resolution

1012
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,599
very few of them needed to go up to that

1013
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,960
level um but we did try to provide

1014
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,480
support and I think you know had we had

1015
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,960
more time I think we would have been

1016
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,280
able to do that more comprehensively and

1017
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,559
better and that's a recommendation that

1018
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,680
I might give to others um I also just

1019
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,839
want to know I know the subject L ones

1020
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,920
were specifically mentioned but I also

1021
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,640
just want to point out the that the

1022
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,680
circulation staff and the inter Library

1023
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,680
loan staff are also the front are also

1024
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,520
very much the front line and unlike the

1025
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,480
subject Liaisons they don't have enough

1026
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,160
background um to be really able to

1027
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,760
defend the you know the decision of the

1028
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,280
library or explain the decision explain

1029
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,400
the decision of the library right um and

1030
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,680
so that's another place you know I think

1031
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,640
we we did we did well in the situation

1032
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,160
that we were in um had could we do it if

1033
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,520
we were to do it again I you know I

1034
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,720
think we would think a little bit about

1035
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,160
making sure that um that any you know

1036
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,720
that that all of our Frontline staff are

1037
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,960
able to talk to our users

1038
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,880
so um I'll just kind of jump in our case

1039
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,000
actually we had I had one of the uh

1040
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,640
subject Librarians Co co-chair the

1041
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
committee with our scholarly

1042
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,800
Communications officers so they were

1043
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,440
part of the process and then their uh

1044
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,359
one of their roles was to kind of take

1045
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,960
this back to the peers and talk to them

1046
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,000
about and keeping them engaged

1047
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,400
throughout the process so so I think

1048
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,640
that uh format uh worked really well I

1049
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,520
just want to go back to um one other

1050
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,680
thing that uh I want to kind of really

1051
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,160
highlight um

1052
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,559
early on in the conversation when we

1053
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,480
started talking to our faculty committee

1054
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,640
about this we actually brought Nick and

1055
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,720
from spark to come talk to the committee

1056
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,800
to have an outside perspective and I

1057
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,040
think that really helped them because

1058
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,720
they were not just hearing that from us

1059
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:48,280
but from from experts out who are

1060
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,480
dealing working on this at a at a at a

1061
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,400
scale of throughout with institutions

1062
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,720
throughout the country so I think that

1063
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,640
was a really also important element

1064
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,359
about because they don't do this on a

1065
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,720
daily Bas it right I mean I can send

1066
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:02,240
them 10 articles they're not going to

1067
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,520
read it but having uh Nick come to

1068
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,559
actually a committee meeting and and

1069
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,040
talk to what's happening um at the

1070
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:13,520
national level and um and that was

1071
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,720
really I think an important and um and a

1072
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,520
critical time for Focus for the faculty

1073
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,960
to really kind of okay yeah we're not

1074
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:25,000
the only ones doing this so and and this

1075
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,240
is um how others have done it in the

1076
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,319
past and this is uh how we can going to

1077
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,760
move forward with this project so I just

1078
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:33,760
want to thank Nick for kind of being

1079
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,760
part of that process as

1080
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,160
well go ahead Stephanie uh I have

1081
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,480
something to say uh in response to part

1082
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,920
being uh way too kind uh but would love

1083
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,480
to hear your answer on the subject

1084
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,520
Leah's on uh librarian uh excuse me

1085
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,520
subject libring question

1086
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,319
first I was just going to add the the

1087
00:46:56,359 --> 00:47:01,960
role of of Li and librarian in our

1088
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:05,480
University they they they were always

1089
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,800
also um ambassadors so a communication

1090
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,800
role but also as we uh we were in a

1091
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,000
title by title selection they had the

1092
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,240
final word uh so the selection have been

1093
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,319
done with through the analysis of of

1094
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,960
very important data but but also at the

1095
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,960
end it was really the the the mediation

1096
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,400
role or the last last call is there

1097
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,280
something and is there some very few

1098
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,760
title you you would add or or or would

1099
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,400
with withdraw and they they had this

1100
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,680
role but it was really thin as a role I

1101
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,359
would say except by the this

1102
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,359
communication uh they had to

1103
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,359
do thanks Stephanie and I think you know

1104
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,880
as a Core theme here it's really helpful

1105
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,640
to see the different the way that

1106
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,240
different institutional contexts you

1107
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,480
know translates into different

1108
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,839
strategies um you know here that that

1109
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,119
work you best for um individual

1110
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:02,079
institutions and and what that looked

1111
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:05,200
like at Montreal um and you just to

1112
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,359
parm's point um you know if you we can

1113
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,119
be helpful s can be a resource um you

1114
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,079
know for institutions that are planning

1115
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,720
to unbundle and it's helpful to have

1116
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,960
that kind of an outside presentation um

1117
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,280
you know I think these are the kinds of

1118
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,960
things that like for spark member

1119
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,160
libraries you know this is exactly the

1120
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,280
kind of support that we want to be

1121
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,720
providing so please don't be shy about

1122
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,440
reaching out if we can be helpful in

1123
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,040
that way um you know I also think with

1124
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,559
the drawing experience related to

1125
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,160
unbundling there's probably a lot of

1126
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,720
knowledge in the community that can you

1127
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,480
know play a similar role um you know but

1128
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,880
to the extent that it's you know helpful

1129
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,240
to have an organization like Sparks

1130
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,760
speak to like that kind of a group um

1131
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,760
you know that those are ways we'd love

1132
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,280
to to support members so please do U

1133
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,200
reach out if we can be be helpful

1134
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,000
there you know already unsurprisingly um

1135
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:53,480
you sort of how each of you has provided

1136
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,839
sort of continuity of access has already

1137
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,960
come up and what we've talked about

1138
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:58,599
already come up a bunch in the questions

1139
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,880
uh in the chat

1140
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,079
unsurprisingly um and I think it's one

1141
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,359
of the things that I'm most excited to

1142
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,000
be able to unpack a little bit more here

1143
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:08,760
um and build on the profiles um you know

1144
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,040
so I know somehow we're already um

1145
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,559
two-thirds of the way through this

1146
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,480
session um but you know would love to

1147
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,720
just quickly go around and hear um you

1148
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,119
know briefly you know sort of how each

1149
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:24,319
of you approached um you know providing

1150
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:26,079
access in L of a big deal um and sort of

1151
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,480
you know what decisions you made at you

1152
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,799
sort of which point points um and I

1153
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,599
think we might unpack this a little bit

1154
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,559
more after the first round but you know

1155
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:35,400
just quickly going around to hear you

1156
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:39,520
know how you all provided access outside

1157
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,880
of a big deal um would be would be great

1158
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,040
um so

1159
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,640
uh uh maybe we can go in backwards order

1160
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,119
that we just uh did the last question

1161
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,920
Stephanie if you want to start if you

1162
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:54,000
don't mind I'll be very fast because

1163
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:57,599
it's so long ago there are new sources

1164
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,920
and but our inter Library Rel Lo at a

1165
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:04,720
fee so we we freed that first uh we we

1166
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,799
bought a journal article archive and

1167
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,720
also we promote OA article that were

1168
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:14,839
available uh through um onpay wall apps

1169
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,480
that we install uh in library PC though

1170
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:21,319
that are the three main uh measures that

1171
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,319
have been uh put for

1172
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,040
us thanks Stephanie uh

1173
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,599
par so for us that was a really

1174
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,240
important El because we didn't know um

1175
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,240
how much request we're going to get

1176
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,680
right that was a big unknown so before

1177
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,559
we even um

1178
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,280
unbundled I created a a one-year

1179
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,559
position for I inter Library loan I said

1180
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,240
okay this is going to be dedicated to

1181
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,480
kind of be dealing with some of the

1182
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,079
unknowns that are going to come um and I

1183
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,240
think that uh was really comforting to

1184
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:55,040
The Faculty that we are actually not

1185
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:59,799
just saying it we putting resources

1186
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,359
behind supporting them them um and as a

1187
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:05,119
year after that um that position was no

1188
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:08,240
longer needed we we transitioned that

1189
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,640
rooll into um a permanent role but u in

1190
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,200
in a different way but I think it kind

1191
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,400
of just showed that we were just we had

1192
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,400
a plan in place that the day we turn the

1193
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,440
switch off we have be putting the

1194
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,920
infrastructure in place to support our

1195
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,920
faculty and

1196
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:29,440
students thanks uh eron do you want to

1197
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,040
speak to MIT experience sure so we again

1198
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,799
we were sort of we were trying to make

1199
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,200
the point that ele was not cooperative

1200
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,720
and we could not come to an agreement

1201
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,359
because they were not cooperative and so

1202
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,559
we did not initially uh have an

1203
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:44,799
alternative access plan for Beyond

1204
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,240
standard in our library loan we did um

1205
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:48,280
as Stephanie just mentioned we sort of

1206
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,359
we encouraged on pay wall we encouraged

1207
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,400
we we put together a website that talked

1208
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:56,599
that gave folks tips on how to find o OA

1209
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,000
articles in Open Access repositories and

1210
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,839
and we sort of made the point that LC is

1211
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,480
making this difficult for you and this

1212
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:06,480
will be to some extent this will now be

1213
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,599
difficult for you um and then we started

1214
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,440
getting complaints about turnaround of

1215
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,960
inter Library loans so I should say that

1216
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,880
um MIT also uses rapid so our turnaround

1217
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,599
rapid our turnaround was you know

1218
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,119
somewhere between hours and you know a

1219
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,640
day like rapid turnaround for IL rapid

1220
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,559
IL is great is fabulous too um but we

1221
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,839
were hearing from that small vocal those

1222
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:28,960
that small number of very vocal faculty

1223
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:31,200
that waited an hour or two hours was not

1224
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,280
um was not sufficient so um so like

1225
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:37,040
Yukon we're now using reprints desk

1226
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,119
about 18 months later uh we decided to

1227
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,400
uh to get commercial document delivery

1228
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,200
so we're using reference desk and

1229
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:47,280
article Galaxy um the costs have come

1230
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:49,319
nowhere near um the cost you know the

1231
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,839
cost of our our previous subscription or

1232
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:54,880
what we with a proposal that we got for

1233
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:57,440
a transformative agreement um we uh it's

1234
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,920
completely unmediated so it's no staff

1235
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,240
time or effort there was you know some

1236
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,520
setup but once we got through the setup

1237
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,920
we decided in like December of 21 that

1238
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,440
we were going to do this we were up for

1239
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,240
the beginning of the semester in you

1240
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,040
know in January of uh of 22 so it took

1241
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,160
you know a couple weeks of evaluation

1242
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,599
set up and testing but it's completely

1243
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,319
unmediated we're providing access uh to

1244
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,359
faculty staff and students alike you

1245
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,480
know there's no anybody who puts in a

1246
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:25,359
request gets their request

1247
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,280
filled um and uh we're really that that

1248
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:31,359
has reduced our complaints uh to on

1249
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,640
turnaround to near to to near zero um I

1250
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,119
will say that Chris and I have some

1251
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,119
friendly disagreement about whether or

1252
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,880
not we should have done that from the

1253
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,200
GetGo or whether we should have waited

1254
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,200
18 months um you know I I came into MIT

1255
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,400
I started at MIT in May of 2020 and I

1256
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,920
come from a technical services

1257
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,520
background which is very focused has

1258
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,799
always my my entire career has been

1259
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,480
focused on how do we get everybody

1260
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:52,200
everything they need as fast as they can

1261
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,280
so you know I came with that that that

1262
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,599
kind of background um I certainly

1263
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,559
understand that for many organizations

1264
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:00,960
you need to have a plan in place like

1265
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:04,240
that um Chris makes a very compelling

1266
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,839
argument that um we gave so I'm very

1267
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,599
compelled by her argument that um we

1268
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,720
that we demonstrated responsiveness to

1269
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,640
the community they told us that IL was

1270
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,319
not fast enough we solved we solved that

1271
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,839
problem for them and um and therefore we

1272
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,160
have built up other credibility um

1273
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:23,520
throughout the Institute uh for you know

1274
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,040
for demonstrating uh demonstrating

1275
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,480
responsiveness and I'm happy to you know

1276
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,720
if there's further Q&A at the end we can

1277
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,880
talk a little bit we get lots of

1278
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,359
questions about our article Galaxy re

1279
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,359
princess setup so we can talk about that

1280
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:36,359
more in depth specific questions and

1281
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:37,839
I'll also put it out there that Mi we we

1282
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:40,960
at MIT are very happy to talk to

1283
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:43,079
individual libraries contemplating this

1284
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,920
um and talking about um you know what

1285
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,960
has worked for us and what we recommend

1286
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,799
so and I see an saying the same thing so

1287
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,319
I'm uh you know I'm happy to talk to

1288
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:53,280
anybody our scom folks are happy to talk

1289
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:56,079
to anybody our in library loan folks are

1290
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,640
happy to talk to anyone um but it's been

1291
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,799
very very low it's not it's not at all

1292
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,319
staff intensive besides you know

1293
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,799
managing the budget and paying attention

1294
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,040
to the tracking of it there's no uh

1295
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,440
there's no mediation in day-to-day

1296
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,480
workflows so if I can jump in really

1297
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:16,520
really quick to

1298
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:18,400
um to expand a little bit on my uh my uh

1299
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,559
support for us having waited to

1300
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,839
implement a faster uh delivery system

1301
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:27,039
until after we'd gotten some set of

1302
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:29,280
complaints is tactically

1303
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,920
um it meant that we did have like you

1304
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,400
know if we got some complaints we could

1305
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:37,319
respond if we started with the most

1306
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,359
responsive and the quickest version of

1307
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,280
access that we could possibly give them

1308
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,440
which is I think what we have now then

1309
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,920
if we got complaints about that which

1310
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,960
you know some we we have heard from some

1311
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,160
that seconds is too long um but if we

1312
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,359
had started there we would have nowhere

1313
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,799
to go except to

1314
00:55:54,359 --> 00:56:00,240
resubscribe and so this way we had a you

1315
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:02,880
know we oh we heard you it hurt it hurt

1316
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,119
more than you know is acceptable so you

1317
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:10,599
know we can go with this one um so there

1318
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:12,760
there was a a shrewdness to the tactics

1319
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:16,119
there

1320
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,359
absolutely totally totally get that and

1321
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:19,440
the other thing I just wanted to throw

1322
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:22,359
just to throw a little bit more data 90

1323
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,880
so 92% of our articles come within a

1324
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:27,559
minute and mentioned three seconds I so

1325
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,039
that's within the minute um and 97% of

1326
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:32,559
them arrive within an hour so um we uh

1327
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,760
and I think I think an you may have said

1328
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,559
this earlier too like it's really hard

1329
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,240
even if we have faculty complaining now

1330
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,920
it's really hard to say um that there's

1331
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,039
you know that you that you can't wait a

1332
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,920
minute and that that Savings of $2.5

1333
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:49,720
million a year is not worth the the it's

1334
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,640
worth a couple of basically a couple of

1335
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:56,319
seconds right less friction it's been

1336
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,319
helpful in that way too

1337
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,440
I think I'm the only one left on this so

1338
00:56:59,799 --> 00:57:03,079
actually one of the requirements of the

1339
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,440
future of journals committee was that

1340
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:07,640
that be seamless that the project had to

1341
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,440
be ready to go and perfect before we

1342
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,200
actually rolled it out so we uh after

1343
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,599
the internal committee I charged them

1344
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:19,839
with either we'll hire uh programmers to

1345
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:21,359
create a a seamless uh uh interface and

1346
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,599
get people what they need when they need

1347
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,520
it or we'll find somebody to do that for

1348
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,280
us and so we found um reprints desk

1349
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,160
which is article Galaxy scholar and we

1350
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,319
insisted on single sign on and so we

1351
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,880
actually worked with them very closely

1352
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:40,760
for six to nine months as they

1353
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,319
implemented single sign on and held off

1354
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,079
on turning it on until that was ready to

1355
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:49,119
go given that that's what the committee

1356
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:52,079
had asked us to do to do this project so

1357
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:55,359
we really tried to stay true to what we

1358
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,160
promised them uh we also held off for a

1359
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,960
year on ele the provos gave us a million

1360
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,559
bucks for one year only to keep

1361
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:07,039
subscribing to elsir as we worked out

1362
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:09,160
the Kinks with Ela but I will say you uh

1363
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,839
many of us know that Publishers will

1364
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,559
give like a three-month buffer period

1365
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,400
between when you end your contract and

1366
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:21,319
when they actually turn off access so we

1367
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:24,400
ended El in December I think it was 23

1368
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:27,880
and they turned off access January 1 and

1369
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,839
didn't tell us and so we had to do some

1370
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,920
scrambling luckily AGS article Galaxy

1371
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:36,880
scholar has tons of great information

1372
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,720
and so um we were able to track the

1373
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:45,799
number out of like 1500 articles 12 did

1374
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:47,680
not arrive um within an hour um so you

1375
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,280
know it was like whatever we've got the

1376
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,119
stats at first we were like oh no we

1377
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,680
need to get this information out there

1378
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,000
we thought we would have time to let

1379
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,520
people know no we had to do it right

1380
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,160
away but that was the only glitch but I

1381
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,079
would say um that was a requirement of

1382
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,000
the committee I totally support Chris's

1383
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,839
approach on that it's like help people

1384
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,520
understand the reality of what this

1385
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:13,359
actually means um to the work that you

1386
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,680
do and I'm I I'm very much in support of

1387
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,880
that but as I said we wanted to to

1388
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:21,000
Really honor what what they did for us

1389
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,000
that committee was so

1390
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:27,599
great all right I'm strategizing how

1391
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:29,920
we're going to get to all these

1392
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,799
questions in the next 21 minutes uh

1393
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,760
lightning rounds I think unsurprisingly

1394
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,160
one of the things that's come up in uh

1395
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,440
the questions that we're also planning

1396
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,960
to touch on relates to to savings one of

1397
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,520
the you sort of earlier questions to

1398
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,079
come in um you know as some saying that

1399
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,480
they're at a relatively small school

1400
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,440
using zerob based budgeting so how did

1401
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,039
you know um uh those who made this

1402
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:55,400
change project demand um and budget for

1403
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:56,599
document delivery um you know and so

1404
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,240
sort of like to kind kind of combine

1405
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:00,039
these questions of you know it' be you

1406
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,400
know wonderful for you all just to sort

1407
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:05,200
of speak a little bit more to you know

1408
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,760
the savings that you know that the net

1409
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,319
savings that you realize and sort of

1410
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,880
what the trajectory has been uh over

1411
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:13,640
over time um but also how you prepared

1412
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,799
and the way that the this you know

1413
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,440
questioner was was asking and sort of

1414
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:20,440
you know projecting those savings and um

1415
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,960
you know whether they were real you know

1416
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,000
sort of at the beginning of the process

1417
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,160
or only became real you know six months

1418
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,400
a year in

1419
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:32,480
anybody want to to jump on that one

1420
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:35,960
first so um yeah I mean the savings are

1421
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,400
real right and um I know

1422
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,680
um and they stayed with within the

1423
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,520
library so it wasn't that they we didn't

1424
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,559
shift them back to the university so I

1425
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:47,280
think that helped us kind of plan for

1426
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,319
projects but also helped us kind of

1427
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,640
undertake some some different

1428
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:56,359
initiatives uh focused on the academics

1429
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,720
and faculty and students um and so so I

1430
01:00:56,359 --> 01:01:00,319
I think that's one of the fears that a

1431
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:04,079
lot of folks have is okay if if we do

1432
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:06,000
this and and have these um substantial

1433
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,520
savings is that going of money going to

1434
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,640
go back to the university and then why

1435
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,000
are we even doing this so I think that's

1436
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,079
a conversation that I would encourage

1437
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,599
you to have with your CFOs before you

1438
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:18,400
can of do take this process and have a

1439
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,880
clear understanding uh and a clear plan

1440
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:25,119
in place that this is um uh you're doing

1441
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,079
this um not to kind of shift this back

1442
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,400
to the university budget but um

1443
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:31,680
hopefully that you can keep it within

1444
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,280
your libraries and and reinvest it in in

1445
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,720
ways that going to me meet today's and

1446
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,720
tomorrow's

1447
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,839
needs yeah and I think you're about to J

1448
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,520
in yeah what was the question again

1449
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:51,760
exactly remind me sorry Fair it became

1450
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,559
sprawling there uh well I was answering

1451
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,640
one one of the things online

1452
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,799
so yeah you could just sort of speak to

1453
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:03,319
uh you the the savings that Yukon

1454
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,760
realized uh you sort of whether they

1455
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:06,079
sort of became real to the liary

1456
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,079
immediately when you made the decision

1457
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,599
or only you know over time and then um a

1458
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:16,279
participant had asked a question about

1459
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:19,000
uh you sort of how you projected demand

1460
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:21,760
U you know for you know for the cost

1461
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,079
associated with il document delivery um

1462
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,760
you know into the future right um so of

1463
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,760
course we didn't realize anything

1464
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:32,039
immediately because there was a lot of

1465
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:35,599
setup time and we did do it over time as

1466
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:37,880
our contracts ended that's when we did

1467
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,400
the negotiation with the Publishers so I

1468
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:44,039
think we've done like two one or two

1469
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,079
every year of the big bundles um Elsa

1470
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:48,599
had a whole year actually two years all

1471
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:51,640
to itself so it was very slow but the

1472
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:53,520
cost realization I I have a chart um and

1473
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,359
we are in year five and we've gone from

1474
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,119
4 and a. half million to 2 and A5

1475
01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:00,520
million and in our Journal spend um how

1476
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:04,839
we predicted I actually used the data

1477
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:07,520
and information from the um uh UC system

1478
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:09,960
uh El project when they you know just

1479
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,760
kind of extrapolating from how much they

1480
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:16,160
were spending on articles per campus to

1481
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,839
provide that I just extrapolated based

1482
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,359
on number of Faculty number of ILS

1483
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:23,160
number of titles um and we found a

1484
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,920
number that way but that's that's the

1485
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,720
data that we used and the data that we

1486
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,760
shared with um our faculty and it's been

1487
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,680
pretty close I mean we did give it a big

1488
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,599
margin 150 to

1489
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:37,440
300K within the first year and the first

1490
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:39,920
year we were at hundred something and

1491
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,520
now we're close to 300 but we've also

1492
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,160
done a lot more of the of the um ending

1493
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,799
the contract

1494
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:53,359
so I'll stop

1495
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:56,400
there so I'll jump in um so uh Ed might

1496
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:59,119
again finances weren't the driver for us

1497
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,240
um so we knew when we canceled our

1498
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,520
contract it

1499
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:08,799
was what about a 2.7 million a year

1500
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:11,160
contract um and uh we we sort of Walled

1501
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:13,119
off that money and it's you know called

1502
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,359
it the elere savings bucket to keep

1503
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,240
track of it um to see if we would need

1504
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:22,720
to use it for um IL you know special I

1505
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:25,160
or whatever um eventually when we did um

1506
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,520
contract with reprints desk and then pay

1507
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:30,559
per article

1508
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,839
um behind the scenes in the first year I

1509
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:37,839
think we saved almost

1510
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:39,720
90% it was about 300,000 total um and uh

1511
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,039
I think in this second year of course

1512
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,720
it's going up because there's more

1513
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,279
content that's been published that we

1514
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,680
don't have access to um but it's not

1515
01:04:45,279 --> 01:04:49,119
going up it's certainly not I think it's

1516
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:53,160
about

1517
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:56,400
400,000 this year right so substantial

1518
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:58,559
substantial savings I mean the

1519
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,680
the story you know basically the bottom

1520
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,839
line here is the old deals even the

1521
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,880
title by title deals that we used to

1522
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:09,799
sign did not provide economies of scale

1523
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,400
because we were buying stuff that nobody

1524
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:13,920
read we knew that with our print books

1525
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,039
we know that we have tons of books on

1526
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:19,119
our shelves that nobody

1527
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:21,400
reads people you know we were buying way

1528
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:24,559
more than we needed at way higher of a

1529
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:28,440
cost so I you know there's there's

1530
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:31,000
substantial savings to be had um we are

1531
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:34,680
looking and working with um the

1532
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,240
administration here with uh some other

1533
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:39,440
values aligned organizations and folks

1534
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:42,240
across the US and

1535
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,839
elsewhere um and some of our own faculty

1536
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,119
to try and develop plans for how we

1537
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:50,200
might reinvest those

1538
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:52,400
savings into something that would uh

1539
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,160
Advance the same principles that caused

1540
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,000
us to walk away we're actually again

1541
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,000
since we did didn't do it out of budget

1542
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,480
concerns we're not super you know we're

1543
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,839
not really um uh wedded to the idea that

1544
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,240
we would funnel it back into some other

1545
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,039
Library

1546
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,000
operation um it's more about let's if we

1547
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:15,799
you know we did this on principle let's

1548
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,799
use the savings to advance those same

1549
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,200
principles but the the I'll just kind of

1550
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:24,000
add a Different Twist to this

1551
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:27,160
conversation so after we did the lcbs so

1552
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,799
we were going gr the other big deals um

1553
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:31,599
so we we be using onab and really kind

1554
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:35,359
of making data informed decision how we

1555
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,079
going to do this so um I'm not going to

1556
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,640
name names but there was another big

1557
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,760
deal that we went with and we said okay

1558
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,359
we going to we found similar savings

1559
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,240
that we're going to

1560
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:47,520
cut um and we when when we back went

1561
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,960
back to

1562
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:54,279
them they kind of just gave us a a over

1563
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:57,400
25% discount because and let us keep

1564
01:06:54,279 --> 01:06:59,720
what we had because and and so I think

1565
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:03,680
you can kind of use this this formula to

1566
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:05,480
kind of negotiate in other ways um and

1567
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,279
because they know that you've already

1568
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:11,119
done this and you're serious about it um

1569
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:12,559
and and that kind of helps with um other

1570
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,200
negotiation that they going through the

1571
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,200
process every

1572
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:25,119
year I just want to add oh sorry sorry

1573
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,480
go ahead I just saw Stephanie come on

1574
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:31,480
you earlier wanted to the an back you

1575
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:35,559
okay I I'll be really rapid uh we we

1576
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:38,720
saved $1 million uh but the saving melt

1577
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:41,359
in the sun with the years that's true so

1578
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:45,559
at that time as we are in Title by title

1579
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:48,240
selection uh we have been able to um to

1580
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:50,760
lower the the the the cost of of

1581
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,279
subscription and then we went back in in

1582
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:55,720
the subscription uh but with the very

1583
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:58,039
lower price so so we rewrite the

1584
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:00,720
historical pricing we had with those uh

1585
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:04,279
publisher and today we are in a

1586
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:06,720
situation uh with uh in transform

1587
01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:10,559
transformative agreements and that type

1588
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,880
of of big deals number number two that

1589
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,880
will might be another session complete

1590
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,400
session thinking about the impact of

1591
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:22,920
those big deals so what I would say is

1592
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:25,120
we are about to face the same crisis or

1593
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,480
very difficult situation so hearing my

1594
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:29,799
colleague is really inspiring my

1595
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:33,159
director of collection is is freaky at

1596
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:34,880
the other side of the phone but but but

1597
01:08:33,159 --> 01:08:37,799
really we we will have to do something

1598
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,600
because what we're doing in reinvestment

1599
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:43,960
we're putting putting money in OA

1600
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:48,080
initiatives 2.5% of our acquisition

1601
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:50,120
budget and we are uh we are trying to

1602
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,120
find an interesting model and we're

1603
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,960
we're work working in the province of

1604
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,960
Quebec where I'm from in in Canada uh we

1605
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:02,679
are working heavily uh were involved in

1606
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,640
in a diamond OA um uh initiative with uh

1607
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:08,040
that have been fund by by the province

1608
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:11,239
of Quebec uh so for five year we're

1609
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:15,679
building an infrastructure with Udi with

1610
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:17,239
pkp with uh the 18 18 libraries of the

1611
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,120
pro uh University libraries of the

1612
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:21,120
province of Quebec with journals from

1613
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,920
the province of Quebec so we're trying

1614
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:27,199
to build something so the energy I want

1615
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,440
to put is there trying to build an

1616
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,560
alternative but I know we won't have

1617
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:35,319
choice but to attack again uh those

1618
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,239
those deals and to withdraw ourselves or

1619
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:43,560
or we will see how we will manage it but

1620
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:46,759
we want to uh just work uh other type of

1621
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,719
solution uh that are really important

1622
01:09:46,759 --> 01:09:51,040
also because as you can hear I am a

1623
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:53,400
French speaker so we have this French

1624
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,560
literature uh scientific literature

1625
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,800
local literature scientific literature

1626
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,400
that we have to to protect and to

1627
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,679
promote and and and all the literature

1628
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,600
scientific literature but there is very

1629
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:07,800
something very specific that have been

1630
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,560
to to be protected and and promoted so

1631
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:14,440
so it it's not easy even 10 years after

1632
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:17,880
we will it it's a continuing process I

1633
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,880
would I would say to end

1634
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:24,800
it I just want to say I put this in the

1635
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,719
chat um we also spent a significant

1636
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,400
amount of onetime money which we have

1637
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,880
because we had a lot of uh staff

1638
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,800
turnover a significant amount in buying

1639
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:37,199
back files so that that decreases the

1640
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:41,480
amount of articles that you have to get

1641
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:43,800
um uh oneon-one um and that was huge and

1642
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:47,000
then um I'm trying to think of what the

1643
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,800
other thing I said um so buying art uh

1644
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,520
the other thing article Galaxy scholar

1645
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,800
preferences Open Access articles so it

1646
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,440
will provide the Open Access article

1647
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,920
first and we've done the analysis and

1648
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:01,080
it's anywhere from 30 to 40% of the

1649
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,480
total articles so you're not actually

1650
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,280
buying all of those articles it's

1651
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:07,400
actually just finding the Open Access

1652
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:11,120
ones and making them available which is

1653
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:13,159
really really good um so just wanted to

1654
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,920
add that

1655
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:18,880
in yeah it's so important right now with

1656
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,840
you know the OSP memo on the verge of um

1657
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,840
you know coming into to force over the

1658
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:26,960
the next year or so um certainly top of

1659
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,760
mind for for us spark uh yeah eron would

1660
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,600
love to hear from you I'm to Pivot

1661
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:35,360
quickly to re yeah I was actually gonna

1662
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,159
say exactly that so um so at MIT we had

1663
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,360
we had I think first mentioned Perpetual

1664
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:42,199
access to elere so we only lost you know

1665
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,440
we we still had access to our pr2020

1666
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:47,520
content but we we have been looking at

1667
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:49,120
our reprint desk data to see what people

1668
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,840
what years of publication people are

1669
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,520
requesting so 50% in the last year 50%

1670
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,719
of the requests were for Content

1671
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:00,320
published this year year 25% was content

1672
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,719
published one year ago and the other 25

1673
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,199
was like the year before that or year

1674
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:05,239
before that we don't have extensive

1675
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,199
longitudinal data so take that for what

1676
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:10,000
it's worth but what people are

1677
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:11,760
requesting is current content so yes

1678
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,600
being on the spark call I want to say

1679
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,679
that we're really hopeful that with the

1680
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,360
ostp memo that um more current content

1681
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,000
is going to become open access without

1682
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,040
embargo by default and then that will

1683
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,199
actually fill a significant amount those

1684
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,960
numbers that that just shared about the

1685
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:31,520
the 30 to 40% you know we're hoping that

1686
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,280
number will go up um and then uh and

1687
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,679
then that will level out the cost so the

1688
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,639
costs are increasing year every year the

1689
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:38,480
longer we're in contract out of contract

1690
01:12:36,639 --> 01:12:41,159
but we're also hoping that that will get

1691
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:45,199
mediated or mitigated by the by more

1692
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:47,159
Open Access content being put forth out

1693
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,679
immediately and I think that also

1694
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:50,480
addresses a question that I saw in the

1695
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:53,600
Q&A there are a couple questions in the

1696
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:56,080
Q&A about um you know aren't the article

1697
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,880
costs just going to spike and that is a

1698
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,280
possibility that is absolutely a

1699
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,480
possibility that the article cost could

1700
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,760
just Spike um so we still need we still

1701
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,639
need more Open Access content to be put

1702
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:09,320
out in the world this doesn't solve for

1703
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:10,480
that problem we're working on that you

1704
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,040
know we we feel like we're working on

1705
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,920
that problem too and we obviously really

1706
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:18,120
appreciate Sparks uh work in that in

1707
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,120
that

1708
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,400
area thanks eron uh so I know now only

1709
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,199
have seven minutes left uh but

1710
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,840
reinvestment has come up quite a few

1711
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:30,600
times also something that we wanted to

1712
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,639
touch on so um you know I think it would

1713
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,639
be really helpful for folks to hear you

1714
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:37,360
just again briefly you sort of how each

1715
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:38,719
of you are you sort of thinking about

1716
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,280
deploying your savings I know that's

1717
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,800
already sort of been touched on but you

1718
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,960
just to tie this to another thing that

1719
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,360
has come up in a a number of questions

1720
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,520
and the that have been submitted um you

1721
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,560
have have sort of raised you sort of how

1722
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,320
your decision to unbundle or go off

1723
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:57,120
contract um you know relates to your

1724
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,480
about various types of Open Access

1725
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,880
agreements that you might um enter into

1726
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,360
like read and publish agreements or

1727
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,600
other you know Open Access agreements so

1728
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,560
you know would love to just quickly go

1729
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,840
around sort of um you know learn a

1730
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,920
little bit more from me you about you

1731
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,320
know sort of whether there's a

1732
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,199
reinvestment component to your savings

1733
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,360
um um you know this other question sort

1734
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:20,400
of how this work sits with other types

1735
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:23,360
of um you know other strategies um like

1736
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,360
U you know Open Access

1737
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:29,159
agreements anyone want to first

1738
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:31,159
there I I'll jump in on the

1739
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:33,239
transformative agreement reading publish

1740
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:34,440
kind of agreements um and Aon will

1741
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:36,840
correct me because I'll get something

1742
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:39,560
wrong um

1743
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,239
but I think one one piece of our story

1744
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:45,040
that we haven't told yet is that two

1745
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:46,800
years in so in in summer of 2022 El

1746
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,960
actually came back to us and said are

1747
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,280
you sure don't you want to talk again um

1748
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,800
maybe that's the part that we wouldn't

1749
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,440
want on the recording sorry that was a

1750
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,320
little snarky um

1751
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,239
so we did talk to them again we we

1752
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:01,040
reiterated the principles we whittel

1753
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:03,480
down some of the principles and said

1754
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,719
which ones were super important to us

1755
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,520
and bottom line they came back and we

1756
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:09,679
told them we were very clear with them

1757
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,920
that we weren't interested in a standard

1758
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,679
read and publish deal um part some of

1759
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,600
the other principles of the MIT

1760
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:18,840
framework have to do with equity in the

1761
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,199
system and we think it's really as

1762
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:23,560
important that everyone has access to

1763
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:25,440
read without economic barriers that

1764
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,840
people have access to par participate in

1765
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,040
the scholarly conversation and to

1766
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:34,639
publish their work without unnecessary

1767
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:36,760
acade uh the monetary barriers um and uh

1768
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:38,280
so we told them we don't you know that's

1769
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,400
just not going to work for us and what

1770
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:42,440
they came back with was a their basic

1771
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,960
standard read and publish deal and pages

1772
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:49,560
and pages of why it was a good deal and

1773
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:52,760
we said no again um do we have some read

1774
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,239
and publish deals with other uh vendors

1775
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,560
yes we do um you know I'd be I'd be

1776
01:15:55,239 --> 01:16:00,679
lying if I said we haven't signed some

1777
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:03,159
um we have signed some that move toward

1778
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:05,760
that that move towards the framework

1779
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:08,120
that show good faith in understanding

1780
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,719
what we're asking for and and providing

1781
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:14,239
some transparency around cost for

1782
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:17,440
example um and other concessions around

1783
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:20,639
um uh open access policy waivers and

1784
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,520
things like that um but on the on the

1785
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:25,920
issue of transformative agreements a

1786
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:28,560
standard read and published deal um um

1787
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,239
it not only is not um aligned with the

1788
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,360
principles that MIT wants to stand for

1789
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:37,120
but also we've done the analysis there

1790
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:40,320
as well and bulk bulk payments by

1791
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:43,719
libraries for apcs also gives no

1792
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:46,239
economies of scale to an institution it

1793
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:48,400
actually costs more because they price

1794
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:50,760
it at the highest possible average and

1795
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:53,320
they put these ceilings on the in the

1796
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,800
deals and they're just not good deals

1797
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,800
from our analysis

1798
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,360
so that's not the reinvestment but I

1799
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,239
think I already talked about what we're

1800
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,480
doing run that that we're working to

1801
01:17:01,239 --> 01:17:06,320
find a way to reinvest our money um to

1802
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:09,080
advance our principles so I'll stop

1803
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,840
there thanks Chris anyone else want to

1804
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:13,440
jump into build on Chris's

1805
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:16,000
point about transformative agreement of

1806
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,719
saving or saving savings transformative

1807
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,920
agreements both yeah what I would what I

1808
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:24,080
want I would say is here in Quebec and

1809
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,440
and and probably in Canada also we are

1810
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,800
going to

1811
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,560
not reconsider but think about the

1812
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,280
impacts of those transformative

1813
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:35,199
agreement about the the accessibility

1814
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:39,480
the the the diff the equity of access

1815
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:42,679
same thing than Chris said a few uh

1816
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:45,280
minutes ago uh and we we just look at

1817
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:47,719
plan s in in Europe and they are going

1818
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:51,080
to leave those type of agreement we

1819
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:53,360
should Sweden have done the same thing

1820
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,400
uh a lot of European countries are

1821
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:58,400
considering to to leave that that type

1822
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:02,400
of of initiative so why should would we

1823
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:04,920
continue that I think and plan s has

1824
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:07,000
documented pretty interesting results

1825
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:10,080
about those transformative agreement

1826
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,400
that they began in in 2018 in Canada we

1827
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,679
began a little bit later so we have I

1828
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,239
would say two two three years of

1829
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:21,440
experiences so all I would say is we

1830
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:23,159
should be inspired in in that area by by

1831
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,760
the European and look at what they are

1832
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:28,320
doing and why they it's PR pretty well

1833
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:33,040
documented so uh we are going to to

1834
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:36,239
consider going out or or work not not

1835
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:39,360
and I don't think that transformative

1836
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:43,679
agreement transform anything

1837
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:46,280
so consider that we have to to find a a

1838
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:50,960
plan s a plan a plan

1839
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:50,960
T to to keep on continuing with

1840
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:57,560
that thanks so much uh and or parum uh

1841
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,920
and know we're running right up to the

1842
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,159
the end but um want to make space if uh

1843
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,000
there's anything else that you all would

1844
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:08,360
like to share and respond to to this

1845
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,080
point now I I think um so bnal has um an

1846
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:15,000
open access policy since 2011 um for

1847
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:17,440
faculty and um and so we are kind of

1848
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,400
looking at ways now from the savings

1849
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:23,560
that we've had how do we kind of

1850
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:27,280
reinvest that um in really open access

1851
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:30,440
initiatives on campus so so that is um

1852
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:33,159
on our list um I I don't really kind of

1853
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:36,600
we not at a place where we I can say

1854
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:38,440
we've done these uh things but that is

1855
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,480
one of the re reinvestment strategies

1856
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:44,800
that that we have in place because um

1857
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:49,480
Open Access is um we promote it with our

1858
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:52,600
faculty we have a a policy for um like I

1859
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:55,400
said we were one of the first small

1860
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,080
liberal larts institution to adopt a

1861
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:01,360
uh policy that the faculty actually The

1862
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:02,960
Faculty adopted uh and so uh I I think

1863
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,199
there's a lot more work to get be done

1864
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,159
on that

1865
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:10,440
front I think connecting uh this work to

1866
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:13,600
an Institutional open access policy is

1867
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:16,920
uh a good way uh to to start to come to

1868
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,080
a close and I also uh just want to

1869
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,440
respond you know there's a great

1870
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,440
question in the chat which we didn't

1871
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,719
have time to to address about you know

1872
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,960
sort of is there any discussion about

1873
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,679
libraries being the keepers of the

1874
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,360
scolly record what cancelling Journal

1875
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,360
means in that context um you know I

1876
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,000
think you know as Aon said I think we

1877
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:34,360
could have a whole discussion on that

1878
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,880
but I'd say you know from my perspective

1879
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,360
you know I hope what this does is help

1880
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,320
to move towards an ultimately more

1881
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,880
sustainable scholarly publishing

1882
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,480
ecosystem that has um you know Library

1883
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,880
Publishers has you know Community

1884
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,880
government infrastructure that's really

1885
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,440
at the core and that that's what you

1886
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,440
know sort of libraries being The Keeper

1887
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:53,800
of the scholly record in an open

1888
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:55,600
environment um looks like um I wish we

1889
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:57,280
had time to go back around to respond to

1890
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,040
that question uh because I think it's

1891
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,320
such an interesting one but I really

1892
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,360
