00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
we've learned some amazing things about

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,440
woodpeckers when they Peck they hit the

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,840
tree going at about 15 M an hour and

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,040
they endure decelerations of up to 1500

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,679
G all to eat to court to make nests and

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,119
to store food for their families but the

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,000
answer to how they withstand these

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,880
decelerations when they Peck is really

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,480
quite simple the deceleration that the

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
brain can withstand without injury

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
depends on its size this is an example

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,080
of a scaling law the smaller the brain

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,400
the larger the deceleration that it can

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,480
withstand scaling laws govern many

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,680
phenomena in nature for instance there's

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,440
a scaling relationship between the speed

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,640
of flight and the weight of a flying

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,760
object and this scaling log governs

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,480
everything from the tiniest little gnat

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,480
to large birds like swans and even up to

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,440
the largest Plains like Boeing 747s

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,760
scaling laws are Universal and they

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,559
describe many many processes in life for
