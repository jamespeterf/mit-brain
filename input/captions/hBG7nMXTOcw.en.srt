1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,640
just the last year the sharp projection

2
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,560
theorem in R2 was was proven and um the

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
proof is is fairly big. It's fairly

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,800
complicated but for the last three

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,439
classes um I'm going to want to circle

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,679
back to that and talk about the new

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
ideas in that proof.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,920
So it's been a while since we talked

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
about it. So I thought we could start by

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
by we'll start just by writing down what

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,440
is the statement.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,960
Um okay so this projection theory I I

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,840
like to think of it as a um geometric

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
measure theory analog of the sum troder

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,320
theorem. So I'm going to start by

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,320
writing down the summary TH

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,000
start by writing down summary try

18
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,840
and there are a bunch of different

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
versions and we have I've picked out a

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,360
particular version that sort of fits

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
into the way the proof is going to go

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,799
for this sharp projection theorem. Um

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,680
okay so it says the following thing. So

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:32,280
if E is a finite subset of R2

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,280
um and then L is a set of lines

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:43,119
or let's say it this way for every X in

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:50,240
E we'll have L X E is a set of S lines

28
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:53,640
that go through X and L uh is the union

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,640
over x

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,040
we don't need this.

31
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,200
So this set of lines L there's at least

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,720
s of them through every point of e.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,440
Okay. Um so then conclusion is that the

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,239
number of lines is at least the minimum

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,720
of a couple of options. There's the size

36
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:22,239
of E time S or there's the size of E to

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:28,680
the 12 S to the three halfves. We'll

38
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,680
call this um option A and option B.

39
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,440
Okay, option A. It's very simple to

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
imagine how this could arise. I have a

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,560
bunch of points I set E and for each

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,000
point I have S lines through it and

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,519
they're just all different from each

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,239
other. So I get E * S lex.

45
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,120
Okay, option B

46
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,280
is more more special, more remarkable,

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,080
although not not that complicated. It's

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
an integer grid and we talked about it a

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,280
couple times in the beginning of the

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,280
class.

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,480
Okay. So in the integer grid

52
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,720
that

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,720
some sense.

54
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,560
So we might have a lot of lines through

55
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,319
each point but still each line is going

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
through many points. So the total number

57
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,720
of lines is a lot less than E * S. And

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,720
if you work it out you get this.

59
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay. So that's the semir trotder

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,640
theorem. Um, we saw early on that it

61
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
implies a sharp projection theorem for

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,000
finite sets in R2. And we're going to

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
try to do some analog for like delta

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,879
balls in R2.

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
Okay, when we talk about delta balls, it

66
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
matters how they're spaced. And the

67
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,840
spacing condition we're going to talk

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
about is the one that Pablo introduced,

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,560
the delta SC condition. So I make a

70
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,120
definition.

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:04:03,280
So uh, if um, E is a subset of R to the

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:04,799
D Let me say that E is delta S C F. Um,

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
okay. So, first of all, I'm going to

74
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,280
imagine here that E is contained in a

75
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,280
unit ball

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,320
or almost unit ball. Okay. And then um

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,959
if you take E and you intersect it with

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,959
a smaller ball,

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
it's basically a new ball. If you take E

80
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
and you intersect it with a smaller ball

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,400
and take the delta covering number of

82
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,880
that then that should be smaller than C

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,919
* little R to the S times the delta

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,080
covering number of the whole set.

85
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,560
Um so for any X and for any R which

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,600
should be at least delta

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,759
so that's a delta SC it's a sort of a

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,720
spacing condition on the set E that says

89
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,720
that it's not too concentrated into any

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,720
small

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,960
okay

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,639
so here is the statement of the sharp

93
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,639
projection theorem

94
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,840
theorem of Orpinan Schmurkin Ren Wong

95
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:21,280
from 2024.

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:24,280
All right. So if E in R2 is a delta SC

97
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,280
set

98
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,759
then um every X in E will have a set of

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:40,039
tubes T subX.

100
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,039
This is a set of delta twos

101
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,240
through x.

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,080
Um, and sorry, E is going to be this is

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
it's just a notation choice, but if I

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,639
don't match my notes, I'll go bananas.

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
It's a delta TC set.

106
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,120
Uh, okay. And so for each point, there's

107
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,199
a set of tubes through it. And this set

108
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,400
of tubes

109
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:09,280
is a delta S C set

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,120
um in in S1. So let's make a picture. So

111
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,680
we have a set E which um you may as well

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,160
think of as a as a set of delta balls.

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,840
So there's E. And then for each of these

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,840
delta balls, it lies in a bunch of

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
tubes.

116
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,199
Okay. And we'll repeat for all of these

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
other guys. Maybe this tube keeps going

118
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,160
and goes through there and tube there.

119
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Okay. But so if this is x, those tubes

120
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,199
there, that's TX

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
and they point in different directions.

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
We can think of the directions as being

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,280
parameterized by S1.

124
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,440
And they are a delta SC set in S1. Yeah.

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,360
What if you multiple tubes that are in

126
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,080
the same direction of being offset from

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,560
each other that I guess delta contain

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,759
the same point? How does that

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,960
>> Yeah. So if you Right. So if I had this

130
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,720
point and then I had

131
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,440
those Oh, I see. Um yeah, we'll think of

132
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,440
those as the same tube.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,720
Okay. Um,

134
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
so the the question was, you know, if I

135
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,039
have my delta ball, could I have two

136
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,880
delta tubes going through it that are

137
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,440
going in the same direction or within an

138
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,039
angle delta of each other? And I'm going

139
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
to think of those as being basically the

140
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,120
same tube.

141
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,880
All right.

142
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,639
Um, all right. Then t is the union overx

143
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,319
tx

144
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,800
which could be smaller than the sum of

145
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
them because one tube might be in tx for

146
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,840
two different x's.

147
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,120
And the question is uh in terms of s and

148
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,919
t how how big does this need to be?

149
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:03,280
Okay. Um

150
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:06,639
cool. Okay. So then the conclusion is

151
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,560
that the size of t is bigger than okay

152
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,160
there's a little complicated stuff

153
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,199
cepsilon delta to the epsilon big c to

154
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,759
the minus order of 1

155
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,919
um and then

156
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,639
there's the minimum of okay so the e * s

157
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,160
corresponds to delta to the minus t

158
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,160
delta to the minus s the so this is this

159
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,640
corresponds to There's somebody that

160
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:38,800
corresponds to B. DeltaUS T / 2 Delta

161
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,919
-3t / 2 that corresponds to B. And there

162
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,360
is a new thing delta to the minus1 minus

163
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,320
S that corresponds to C. Well, sorry

164
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
that doesn't correspond to anything.

165
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
There was no C up there. I will call it

166
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,560
C.

167
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,560
Okay. Who So who is C?

168
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Um,

169
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,040
so C is a new phenomenon that has to do

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,959
with the fact that these tubes and balls

171
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,760
have a thickness which we didn't have up

172
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:15,160
there. So here E could just be a could

173
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,160
be any set

174
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,440
and then T is a random set

175
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,760
of delta to the minus1 minus S or so

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,320
tubes.

177
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,600
And the probability that a delta tube

178
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,519
goes through a given point is delta. So

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,320
a typical point TX would would

180
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:47,519
essentially be a random

181
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,440
set of around delta to the minus s tubes

182
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
and a random set there might be a couple

183
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
that are close together but on the whole

184
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,519
that would be that would be a delta s

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,200
set of tubes.

186
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,440
Okay so that's where this new option

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,680
comes from. Cool. Okay. Yeah. and option

188
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
B or is one of the exponents supposed to

189
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,760
be an S fun?

190
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,880
>> Yes, thank you.

191
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,120
That's supposed to be an S,

192
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,560
right? Okay, so let's put these on top

193
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,120
of each other for a second.

194
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,839
So the size of E corresponds to the

195
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,839
delta to the minus T and big S

196
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:28,000
corresponds to delta to the minus little

197
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:31,760
S. And so so those match up

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,760
and then C is something new.

199
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,399
Okay, good. Now, I realized I forgot one

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
hypothesis that I'm going to add and

201
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,160
then we'll pause and you can look at

202
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,839
these statements.

203
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,320
Okay, so

204
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,200
we needed one more hypothesis in our

205
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,519
list of hypotheses, which is that this S

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
should be bigger than one.

207
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
You see, if I just had one line going

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
through each of these points, then I

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,720
could just have one line and a bunch of

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,279
points on it and one is not bigger than

211
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,600
this.

212
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,560
Okay, so that's a special case. And

213
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,839
there is an analogous condition here in

214
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,399
our list of hypotheses. We need little s

215
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,560
to be bigger than zero. This corresponds

216
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,680
to having not just one tube through each

217
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,680
of these points, but pretty many.

218
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,120
Okay, so that's the statement of summary

219
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,000
trotder and the parallel statement of

220
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,200
this is the firstenberg set conjecture

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,200
um proven just recently.

222
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,880
So let's pause there to digest and see

223
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,760
if there are questions or comments about

224
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,760
the statement of this theorem.

225
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
Yeah,

226
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,640
>> I'm still having a hard time

227
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,519
understanding what's going on in

228
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,200
case C. Would it be possible to draw a

229
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,279
typical example?

230
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,079
>> Yeah, let's draw case C. Okay, so E

231
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,079
could go anywhere

232
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,720
and then

233
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,399
um I'm going to draw a random set of

234
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,800
delt of of of tubes a bunch of them. So

235
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,800
um okay, so here I go.

236
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,000
So I I drew these tubes

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
or I tried to do it without thinking at

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
all about where the points are. There

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:49,760
was nothing clever going on.

240
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:52,320
Um but uh I drew a whole lot of them and

241
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,000
uh one over a delta fraction if if I

242
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,360
draw a random tube the probability that

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,320
goes through here is delta. So if I draw

244
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,079
uh m o times 1 over delta random tubes,

245
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,959
I'll have about m of them going through

246
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,399
this point. So let's say I do that. So I

247
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
have about m tubes going through this

248
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,320
point. Now what directions will they

249
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,200
point in? Well, they'll point in random

250
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,880
directions. And a random direction, a

251
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,959
random set is a is a delta SC c set

252
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
where s where delta to the minus s is

253
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,800
the number of points.

254
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,800
So so that's that's why we have this

255
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,240
Okay, other questions or comments?

256
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,839
Okay, so now let's start talk about the

257
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,880
history of work on this problem.

258
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,800
Um, and the going through the history of

259
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
work on the problem will also be an

260
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,480
excuse to kind of recap a big section

261
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,560
big chunks of our class.

262
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,079
So

263
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,079
[Applause]

264
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:04,560
history of work slash

265
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:08,399
recap of the class.

266
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay. So first I'll do what I'll call

267
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:17,000
classical bounds which are uh

268
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,000
essentially due to calfman and falconer

269
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,000
and they were sort of written up in the

270
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,279
context of this theorem. Calfman and

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
falconer were talking about projection

272
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,480
theory. This is a little bit more

273
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,959
general um but they were written up. So

274
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
this kofman kman and falconer were in

275
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:40,959
the 60s and 70s. a pretty long time ago

276
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,399
and then um adapted a bit by Wolf.

277
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,800
Okay, the first classical argument is

278
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,800
double counting.

279
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,880
There actually two slightly different

280
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,880
ways of dueling double counting and I'll

281
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,519
tell you what they give. The first way

282
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,199
gives that if s is at least t

283
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,800
um then um the number of tubes is at

284
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,320
least option a

285
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,920
and this is sharp.

286
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,760
Okay. So let's think about what it

287
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,959
means.

288
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,519
So s is at least t. That means that the

289
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:24,079
number of directions through each point

290
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:27,920
is bigger than the number of points.

291
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,920
So um draw a little picture to the side

292
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,800
here.

293
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,880
So I have a few points, not very many.

294
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
And then through each tube I'm going to

295
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,720
draw through each point I'm going to

296
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,279
draw a bunch of tubes. And the number of

297
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,000
directions is bigger than the number of

298
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,760
points. So I have a picture like this.

299
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,399
So what you see is that most of these

300
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,040
tubes don't go through any other point

301
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,440
besides the initial point.

302
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,320
Uh and that gives an easy estimate for

303
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,000
the number of tubes

304
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
has to be at least the number of points

305
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,720
times you know the number of tubes

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,759
through.

307
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,320
Okay. There is another way to do double

308
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,480
counting and it says that in general so

309
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,959
just if s is bigger than zero which

310
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:21,160
we've been assuming then the number of

311
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,160
tubes is at least delta to the minus 2s.

312
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Um

313
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,920
um so

314
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,320
let me just let me just leave this one

315
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,880
as an exercise. We've done we've done

316
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,880
some double counting.

317
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:53,639
Okay.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,639
Um then there was a forier method

319
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,440
um that we did in in class and the

320
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:05,039
forier method showed that t was bigger

321
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,480
than the minimum of two things. One of

322
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:14,439
them is option C and the other one is

323
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,439
delta to the 1 - S times option A.

324
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,480
And um so this number is smaller than

325
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,600
one. So this is smaller than A. So this

326
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,360
isn't sharp uh unless we're so lucky

327
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,520
that S is equal to one in which case

328
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,400
this is the minimum of A and C. And

329
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,919
that's that's good. So this is sharp

330
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,919
if s is equal to one.

331
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
Okay. So I won't redo this one but this

332
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,600
is uh just the forier method that we did

333
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,080
in the in the third week of of our

334
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,240
class.

335
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,240
Okay. So the classical methods are

336
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,240
occasionally sharp but usually not

337
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:03,410
[Applause]

338
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:13,840
um and um okay so another comment about

339
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,520
this story that about why why why this

340
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,520
is difficult is that some of these

341
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,000
statements are fields dependent. They're

342
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,559
true over R, but they're false over C.

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,320
But others others uh are true in all

344
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,720
fields. Um so if we go back to the

345
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,679
beginning,

346
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,320
the summary detrader theorem is true in

347
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,480
both R and C although it's not true in

348
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,480
all fields

349
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,039
and is

350
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,480
all C in some in some finite fields.

351
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,799
Well, it's really it's false in all

352
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,799
kinds of things.

353
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:59,760
Okay,

354
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:02,880
this theorem here is uh true r but it is

355
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,039
false over

356
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,799
and that counter examples kind of

357
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,640
haunted all of us who have been working

358
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,400
on this.

359
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,679
And one feature of these classical

360
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,240
methods is that they don't distinguish.

361
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:21,080
um they work

362
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,080
over R or C.

363
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,720
Okay. Um okay. So to prove this theorem

364
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,000
we have to distinguish R and C. So we'll

365
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,120
have to do something which in some way

366
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,640
is different from these. Um and the next

367
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,880
phase in the history is begins with Bans

368
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,400
projection theorem. And I it's a phase

369
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,400
that I'll label as epsilon improvements.

370
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,170
[Applause]

371
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
So for quite a while actually there

372
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,600
really was no progress on these

373
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,160
classical methods. These ma classical

374
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,679
methods are from the 60s and 70s. Wolf

375
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,760
adapted them to slightly more general

376
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,640
setting but um but basically there was

377
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,120
no progress for a long time. And phase

378
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,120
two is the phase of epsilon

379
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,120
improvements.

380
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,960
And the dates of this phase are from

381
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,640
around 2000 to very recently.

382
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,640
Um, okay. Where is the Borgan projection

383
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
theorem?

384
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,400
And it implies with a little work but

385
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,120
not that much work an improvement over

386
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,360
the classical methods in a very

387
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:39,600
particular situation.

388
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,679
So it says if t is one and s is 12

389
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,640
then

390
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,559
this number of tubes is at least delta

391
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,919
to the minus1

392
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,080
minus some epsilon we're g

393
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,240
um so if you just plug in the classical

394
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,440
bounds up there it would give this and

395
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,520
there's an improvement although only for

396
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,880
a rather particular for one particular

397
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,880
choice of the parameters.

398
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay. Um so that was uh in 2000

399
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,720
and the next improvement

400
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,080
is a theorem of Orphin and Schmurkin

401
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,760
from 2021.

402
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,200
And you could think of it as a

403
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,600
generalization of this. It gives an

404
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,360
epsilon improvement but in not just for

405
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,000
this special value of the parameters but

406
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:33,360
for lots of values of the parameters. So

407
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,480
they proved that if t is bigger than s

408
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,559
uh which is bigger than zero

409
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,919
then

410
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:46,000
the number of tubes is at least delta to

411
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,080
the minus 2s minus epsilon.

412
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,520
So delta to the minus 2s is what you

413
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,320
would get classically by double

414
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:57,840
counting. It takes half a page and then

415
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,000
uh after 50 years and 50 pages you can

416
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,000
get this.

417
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,440
All right.

418
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,440
So in our class we

419
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,799
said a lot about the proof of the BADN

420
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
projection theorem. I don't I wouldn't

421
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,640
actually wouldn't say that we proved

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,240
every did every step every detail and um

423
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,679
uh this one. Okay, let me say so we

424
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
haven't proven this in but let me just

425
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,480
say something about the proof. So this

426
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,559
is based on reg projection theorem

427
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,559
um plus a bunch of ideas.

428
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,520
Okay. And so an emotional reaction that

429
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,600
I had to to learning this and going

430
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,840
through it with you is that it is it's

431
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,840
hard work

432
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,159
and also epsilon is really tiny. seems

433
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,760
like you know the harder the clever we

434
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,559
are the harder we work we keep making

435
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,559
epsilon smaller

436
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,200
okay so this was the second phase of the

437
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
history where people were able to make

438
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,840
epsilon improvements I could also

439
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,840
mention other theorems not about this

440
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,720
exact problem but but in a similar

441
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,880
spirit so for many different problems it

442
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,360
was possible to make an epsilon

443
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,120
improvement um by using burgans's

444
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,039
projection theorem and by using and

445
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,240
developing ideas related to the ones we

446
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,080
put there. Uh okay, so it was hard work.

447
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,159
Epsilon was really tiny. But one

448
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,039
positive thing about it is that it did

449
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:32,720
distinguish uh R from C. So both of

450
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,840
these theorems are false over C. So we

451
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,320
did start to do that.

452
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,799
Okay. Um cool. So this theorem

453
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,640
represents a third stage in the history

454
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,880
where we didn't just improve by an

455
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,320
epsilon over the classical results but

456
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,720
we improved substantially and in fact

457
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,720
proved people proved the sharp result.

458
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,120
This is so so I should mention this.

459
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,120
This is sharp.

460
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,840
This is sharp

461
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,840
for any essence.

462
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,000
>> Yeah.

463
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,000
>> Is that delicac

464
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,360
or

465
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,360
>> Yeah, it's sharp up to this. So

466
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,000
sharp up to the delta to the epsilon.

467
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,120
In future I'm going to abbreviate that

468
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,799
mess by this. we won't be at the level

469
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,799
of detail to have all of this in.

470
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Okay. So, um so this this the story I

471
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,880
wanted to try to tell to explore over

472
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,880
the last three classes is how is it

473
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,400
possible to get from these epsilon

474
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,880
improvements to sharp theorems. That's

475
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,760
that's our our theme for the rest of the

476
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,919
class. Um, and if I had to say it in a

477
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,159
couple of sentences,

478
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,320
what happened was people found a way

479
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,960
where you can use an epsilon improvement

480
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,520
theorem and you can use it over and over

481
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,520
again and sort of each time you use it,

482
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,679
you improve a little bit the exponent in

483
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,720
your bound until you bring the exponent

484
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,320
up to the sharp value.

485
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,679
Okay? Now, it's not at all obvious how

486
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,000
to do that, and that's what we're we're

487
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,480
going to try to explain. uh um not with

488
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,320
all details but to to make it seem like

489
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,120
a plausible approach that you could that

490
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,440
you could carry.

491
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,559
Cool. Okay. So any questions or comments

492
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,279
before we start? Yeah.

493
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,360
>> Does doing that process make the like C

494
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,840
to the O one constant kind of

495
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,240
corresponding way I guess tiny compared

496
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,480
to the epsilon constant?

497
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,640
>> Um yeah. So I think the question is as

498
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
as we as we use our epsilon improvement

499
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,120
theorem many times does that cause this

500
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,279
to become remarkably bad?

501
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,559
I think it does. Okay. I think that this

502
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,720
is remarkably bad.

503
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,159
Yeah.

504
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,440
Okay. Great. So today I my first goal is

505
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,960
I want to describe the simplest example

506
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,279
where you can get where you can use an

507
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,120
epsilon improvement theorem to prove a

508
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,960
sharp theorem.

509
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,960
And then after that if we have time I

510
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,130
will outline the proof of the big thing.

511
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,739
Okay.

512
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,739
[Applause]

513
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,720
Okay. So, simplest

514
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
example

515
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,279
where

516
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,279
epsilon improvement

517
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,480
leads to sharp out.

518
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,400
Okay, so this is a theorem of Beck from

519
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,480
around 1980

520
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,000
which is about the incidences of points

521
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,559
and lines. So it's in the setting of the

522
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,679
summary troder theorem.

523
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,000
It says if E is a subset of R2 and it's

524
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,039
not all on a line and in fact I'll say

525
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,919
at most half of it is on a line. So for

526
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:45,279
any line L

527
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:48,640
L intersect E is at most half of it.

528
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:53,120
Then the conclusion is there exists some

529
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,120
point X in E. So that uh all right so

530
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,080
let me make a definition. So I I'll draw

531
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,080
a picture. So this is E.

532
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,039
Here's our set E. Here's a point X.

533
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,240
Starting at X, I will draw all the lines

534
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,960
that start at X and go through some

535
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,960
other points at E.

536
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,880
Okay. So what's that set? So I'll call

537
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:25,760
it L XE. This is the set of lines. So

538
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,880
that lines L. So that X is in L and L

539
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,600
intersect E is not just X. So it has

540
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,600
size at least two.

541
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,440
Now the conclusion is there is a point

542
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:43,799
in E so that the size of LXE is

543
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,799
comparable to the size of E.

544
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,279
This is clearly a sharp theorem because

545
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,640
the largest possible size that this

546
00:28:51,279 --> 00:29:00,039
could be is the size of

547
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,039
all right. Um let me do a proof sketch.

548
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,919
Um and we'll so we'll see that this

549
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,000
follows from sem ready troder. Um but

550
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,799
we'll also see that we don't really need

551
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
the sharp exponents in semi troder. We

552
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:17,039
just need to have something that's an

553
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,960
epsilon better than um uh than a than a

554
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,640
simple bound. That's why I've erased it

555
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
but than the double counting kind of

556
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,440
bound.

557
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,600
Okay. So here we go. So the sketchy part

558
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,320
of my proof sketch is that I will

559
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,760
suppose that we are in the uniform case.

560
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:38,720
Namely for every x in E, I will suppose

561
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,559
that lx of E has size around S.

562
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,399
So it's not really the case that they

563
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,120
would all be comparable, but I'll just

564
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:48,880
explain that special case.

565
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,080
Okay. So now um how many lines are there

566
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,640
in total? We can do a double count to

567
00:29:52,080 --> 00:30:00,320
find the total number of lines. So we're

568
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:04,080
going to double count pairs um x l where

569
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:09,120
x is in uh e

570
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:14,679
and l is in our set of lines.

571
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,679
So our total set of lines is going to be

572
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,039
let's do this.

573
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,640
Okay. So how big is le? Um well we could

574
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,520
count the number of these pairs in two

575
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,399
ways. We could count okay look at all

576
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,080
the points of E and each of them is in S

577
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,559
lines

578
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,080
or we could say look at each of these

579
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,000
lines

580
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,000
and um how many points are in each line?

581
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,679
Well,

582
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,399
the number of the size of

583
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:55,520
uh S the size of E intersect L

584
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:59,600
for a typical L and L XE would be the

585
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,120
size of E divided by the size of L XE.

586
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,360
Right? Because I have all the points in

587
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
E. They are divided among the lines of

588
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,760
LXE. Again, assuming it's uniform, they

589
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,760
would all have around this size.

590
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,600
E over L XC

591
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,600
which is S.

592
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,480
Okay. So this is the number of points

593
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,240
times they're each in S lines versus the

594
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,960
number of lines times they each have

595
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,279
this many points.

596
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,200
Okay. So when we solve we see that the E

597
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:43,880
actually drops out and we conclude that

598
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,880
LE is around S squ.

599
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,720
Okay. So um our goal is to have a lower

600
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,600
bound on on S. So we want to have a

601
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,279
lower bound on LE and the semi trder

602
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,480
theorem exactly gives us a lower bound

603
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,480
on LE. So we can use it. So the semi

604
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:10,480
trider theorem tells us that L

605
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:15,840
is at least the minimum of S * E and S

606
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:19,279
to the three * E to the 12. Okay, but

607
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:23,600
this L E is is S squ. So if you compare

608
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:26,640
these we can get a lower bound for S.

609
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,240
In in this case we would have S^ squ is

610
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,240
bigger than SE. So s is bigger than e

611
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,840
and in this case we would have s^ squ is

612
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,840
bigger than s^ 3 e to the 12 and with a

613
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,800
little algebra that is again s bigger

614
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,279
than e.

615
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,919
[Applause]

616
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,919
Um so

617
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,919
right.

618
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,080
Okay.

619
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:56,640
[Applause]

620
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,240
Okay.

621
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,240
Right.

622
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Now,

623
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,760
now I claim that we didn't need to have

624
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,480
this exact formula here. Let me write

625
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,600
down all that we needed to to know.

626
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,600
So what we needed to know

627
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:25,919
is just that if E is much bigger than S

628
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,399
um then the size of L E is much bigger

629
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,399
than S squ.

630
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,559
So that's a feature you can read off of

631
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,159
this formula. If E is much bigger than

632
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,640
S, then either one of these is much

633
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,720
bigger than S^ squ. And that's all we

634
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,760
needed to know because we know that L E

635
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,960
is only S squ. So by the contraositive

636
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,120
we could see that E

637
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,919
S is not much smaller than E S should be

638
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,120
at least around E.

639
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,960
Okay. So this thing that we needed to

640
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,519
know

641
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,080
is very similar to the Orpin and

642
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,080
Schmurkin theorem.

643
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,599
E is much bigger. So now let's look up

644
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,639
at that Orpin and Schmurkin theorem says

645
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,480
if T is bigger than S just bigger than

646
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,440
zero.

647
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,599
So T is measuring the size of our set E

648
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,240
and little S corresponds to big S.

649
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,399
So that first hypothesis is saying that

650
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,240
the set is much bigger than the number

651
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,919
of directions.

652
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,159
And then the conclusion is that the

653
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:37,240
number of lines is much bigger than S^

654
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,240
squ. that thing is this.

655
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,839
Okay. So this matches

656
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,960
the theorem of Orpin and Schmurkin the

657
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,960
epsilon improvement theorem.

658
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,800
Okay. So that suggests an idea that we

659
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
could use that epsilon improvement

660
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,520
theorem by Orpin and Schmurkin and put

661
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,440
it into an argument like this one and

662
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,680
prove some kind of generalization of

663
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,480
Beck's theorem that might have a sharp

664
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,440
conclusion even though we stuck into it

665
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,000
just a epsilon improvement

666
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,040
and that actually works. So I'm going to

667
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,040
write it down now for us.

668
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,400
Okay.

669
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,240
So this is called the continuum

670
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,400
or we could call it in our class the

671
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,400
delta ball version of back theory.

672
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:23,119
Okay. So this is a theorem of merkin and

673
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,800
wong in 23 I think.

674
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,720
All right. So we're going to translate

675
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,800
this theorem into the language of delta

676
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,760
SC sets.

677
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:36,720
So we're going to say if E is a deltaU

678
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
set, I'm going to leave out the C. Uh

679
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,280
things will depend on C, but E is a

680
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,240
deltaU set. Okay, so that's our set. Now

681
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,960
I need an analog of this hypothesis that

682
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,680
E is not too much in the line. And the

683
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,920
analog says that E will be not too much

684
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,240
in any thin rectangle.

685
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,079
So we'll say if R is a row by one

686
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,040
rectangle

687
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,440
um then

688
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,680
if you take E and you intersect it with

689
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,680
R take the delta covering number of that

690
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,920
should be kind of smaller than the total

691
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
delta covering number.

692
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,599
Okay so it should be row to the ADA

693
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,119
smaller than constant row to the ADA is

694
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,800
smaller than the total delta covering

695
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,440
number. Maybe we can we can put the C

696
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,119
back here also. So who is ADA? At the

697
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,960
very beginning of the story, we'll say

698
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,160
for every

699
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,440
ADA bigger than zero. So ADA should be a

700
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,040
positive number. Okay. So this is a not

701
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,599
super strong condition, but it's saying

702
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,520
that E is not heavily concentrated into

703
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:46,000
a thin rectangle.

704
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:51,440
Okay. And then the conclusion is um

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:56,079
there exists an x in e s so that

706
00:37:51,440 --> 00:38:00,079
um the size of lxe

707
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,320
is greater than um

708
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,160
uh the minimum

709
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,560
of delta to the minus u and one. So this

710
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,480
would be and sorry not one delta to the

711
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,960
minus one.

712
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,440
Okay. So what's going on here? The our

713
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,520
original theorem would say that lxe e is

714
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,160
at least the size of e and that's the

715
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,040
size of so that's what it's doing here.

716
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,359
On the other hand if I had every delta

717
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,960
tube if lxe consisted of all the delta

718
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,280
tubes through x there would only be

719
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,960
delta inverse of them. So it couldn't

720
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,960
possibly be bigger than this. So we have

721
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,599
Okay.

722
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,839
Um cool. So that's the statement of the

723
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,920
theorem and it is again uh sharp because

724
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,400
as we just explained this couldn't

725
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,760
possibly be bigger than this and it also

726
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,760
couldn't possibly be bigger than this.

727
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Okay.

728
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Um

729
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,119
correct.

730
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,839
So this theorem is sharp. It's also

731
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,839
false over C.

732
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Right? So the example over C would be

733
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,760
that the set E

734
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:28,160
could be uh R2 which is sitting in C2.

735
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,839
And if you imagine R2, if you take any

736
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,280
point in R2 and look at all of the

737
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:37,359
lines, complex lines that um go through

738
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,800
that point, um there aren't the the each

739
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,960
one of them goes through many of the

740
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,320
points of R2 and um and the number there

741
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,720
aren't that many of them. It would

742
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,720
violate this.

743
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,839
Okay, so this theorem is uh in the

744
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,000
general spirit of projection theory. um

745
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,720
it is a sharp theorem and it

746
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,160
distinguishes R from C and I believe it

747
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,200
is the first such theorem in the

748
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,359
literature. So we were trying for 20

749
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,800
plus years to distinguish R from C. For

750
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,200
a long time we could only do it with

751
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,880
epsilon improvements. But this is not

752
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,960
just an epsilon improvement on what was

753
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,440
known before. It's not just an epsilon

754
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,960
improvement on what's true over over C.

755
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,720
And it's a sharp theorem.

756
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,720
Okay. Any questions or comments about

757
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,960
the statement?

758
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:32,240
So the problem depends on

759
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,680
>> yeah so if you unpack this it must

760
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,440
depend on ADA. Uh I think it is a

761
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:43,040
constant depending on epsilon and ada

762
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,520
delta to the epsilon and big c to the

763
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,200
minus big.

764
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,200
So it depends on it depends on aa

765
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,760
it's conceivable that this depends on

766
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,760
ada. I'm not sure about that.

767
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,640
Other questions or comments?

768
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:20,079
Okay. Okay. So the the idea in the first

769
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,760
place is to imitate this proof of Beex

770
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:28,560
theorem proof that converts um a uh

771
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,400
a an epsilon improvement on some simple

772
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,160
estimate for sem ready troder into a

773
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,520
sharp estimate for this beck kind of

774
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,000
thing. Um but when we try to do that we

775
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,960
will see that there is an issue with it.

776
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,880
Um and and when we flesh out the proof a

777
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,359
little more, it will involve using the

778
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,520
Orpin and Schmurkin theorem not just

779
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,520
once but many times at many different

780
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
scales.

781
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,640
All right. So let's sketch the proof.

782
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,680
So first plan

783
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:08,270
is to imitate

784
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,520
the proof of uh of Beck.

785
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,640
[Applause]

786
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:17,050
Um okay. So let's carry that out over

787
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:24,589
here. I'll put the beex proof up.

788
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:24,589
[Applause]

789
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,310
All right.

790
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,040
So attempt attempt one.

791
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:54,560
[Applause]

792
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:58,000
All right. So let's say that lxe

793
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,000
is a delta SC

794
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
set.

795
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,319
Now that's related to the cardality of

796
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,720
LXE. This is a theorem about the

797
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,760
cardality of LXE. What is the

798
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,680
relationship? Well, it implies that the

799
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,800
cardality of lexe is at least uh around

800
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,040
delta to the minus s, but it could be

801
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,040
much bigger.

802
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:28,160
[Applause]

803
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,000
Okay, so an example where these would be

804
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,960
about the same is if lxe was sort of

805
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
like an s-dimensional caner set. An

806
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,040
example where they would be very

807
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,319
different is uh if is if LXE was very

808
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,520
clumped. So here's a piece of S1 and

809
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,160
maybe LXE

810
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,720
is clumped like that. So these dots

811
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,720
represent Lexi.

812
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,960
So if it was if if Lex was really

813
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,160
clumped into a much smaller interval

814
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,599
then um S would actually have to be

815
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,160
zero.

816
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,400
This is not a delta SC set except for S

817
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,160
equals Z.

818
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,359
On the other hand, the cardality of LXC

819
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,200
in this picture is is is large and in

820
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,440
particular, it's much larger than delta

821
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,440
to the minus0.

822
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,640
Okay, so this S is some non-conentration

823
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,040
condition and non-conentration forces

824
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,520
our set to be pretty big. But it could

825
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,760
also be much bigger than that if it was

826
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,760
kind of clumped.

827
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,839
Okay. So let's uh let's try to imitate

828
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,560
our proof. Uh I'm going to suppose that

829
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:51,040
we're in the uniform case.

830
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:55,880
So all of the lxe have the same s

831
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,880
and the same size of lx.

832
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,240
Okay, we can do our same double

833
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,240
counting.

834
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,160
That part doesn't change at all. And it

835
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:13,400
has it gives us L E is at least

836
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,400
L XE^2.

837
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,280
Okay, sorry, is approximately LXE squ.

838
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,440
And so to get a lower bound on LXE, it

839
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,440
suffices to get a lower bound on LE.

840
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,640
What happens here? Um so now we can

841
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:38,319
apply the uh theorem of Orpin and

842
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:41,520
Schmurkin epsilon improvement

843
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,880
which I just erased in a suboptimal use

844
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:50,960
of blackboards. Um but uh what it says

845
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:54,560
in this case is uh that if u if s is

846
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,200
smaller than the minimum of u and one

847
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,400
but bigger than zero

848
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:05,760
then we get

849
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:08,160
le e is at least delta the minus 2s

850
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,319
minus epsilon. So that this would be the

851
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,119
classical bound

852
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,119
and then we have this.

853
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,640
Okay. And then we're interested in lxe.

854
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:24,240
That tells us that lxe

855
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:27,240
is at least delta to the minus s minus

856
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
epsilon.

857
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:42,640
Okay, so let's take stock.

858
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,440
If S were equal to the minimum of U and

859
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,280
one, then LXE would be at least delta to

860
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,359
the minus S. That would be the bound we

861
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,480
want to prove. So in that case, we would

862
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:55,280
be very happy.

863
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,920
Okay. Now suppose S is in this range.

864
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,319
Well, then we get this bound.

865
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,560
This bound is a tiny bit better than

866
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,560
this bound,

867
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,280
but that's all.

868
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
This argument didn't work so nicely as

869
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,960
that argument because in that case there

870
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,240
was no distinction between cardality and

871
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,160
the value of s. In that case this was

872
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,599
the same as this. So we would get a

873
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,440
contradiction at this moment and we

874
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:30,280
could we could conclude that actually s

875
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,280
is the minimum of u and one.

876
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Okay.

877
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:43,040
Um so we did learn something. Um

878
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,599
you know if if lxe were kind of spread

879
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,680
out you then you might hope that the

880
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,599
cardality would be about delta to the

881
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:55,359
minus s and in that spread out case then

882
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:58,560
we could get we would follow that that s

883
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:03,200
was the minimum of u and one.

884
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:05,839
So we see so we see this correlary

885
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:10,400
if um

886
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:13,280
lxe is a delta s set

887
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,240
and the size of lxe

888
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,960
is around delta to the minus s then we

889
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,839
would get that the size of lxe is

890
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,079
greater than around the minimum of delta

891
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,960
to the minus u and delta to the minus1

892
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,319
and we would be happy.

893
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,920
But it's a big if and we don't

894
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,720
understand yet very well what might

895
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,720
happen if these sets were a little more

896
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,720
clumped.

897
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,720
Okay. Cool.

898
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:53,640
All right. So um let me put up a summary

899
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,640
of what we've learned so far. So lama

900
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:03,040
if s is bigger than zero and a typical

901
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,680
lxe

902
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,319
is delta sc.

903
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,559
Um then

904
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:16,160
size of typical lxe is at least delta to

905
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,640
the minus s minus epsilon or sorry yeah

906
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,520
if

907
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:25,000
0 is less than s is less than the

908
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,000
minimum of

909
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,240
okay so the proof of this theorem we

910
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,839
don't have it yet we have this lema um

911
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,319
the proof of this theorem is by

912
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,480
bootstrapping this lema using it many

913
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,119
times at different scales and locations.

914
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,280
So we are effectively using the epsilon

915
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,760
improvement many times not just once and

916
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,760
at many scales.

917
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,530
about it.

918
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,530
[Applause]

919
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:25,480
All right. So, let's do a sketch of this

920
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,480
bootstrap iteration.

921
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:45,160
Okay. Um so we're going to suppose

922
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,160
that lxe first of all is uniform

923
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:52,960
and also that it is delta sc for some s

924
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,520
which is bigger than zero. It's the

925
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,520
start of our bootstrap.

926
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,319
So because it's uniform and it's a delta

927
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:05,280
SC set then it follows that if you take

928
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:08,240
its sort of its row neighborhood then

929
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,280
this is a row SC set

930
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,640
for every row.

931
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:17,599
And now we can apply our lema.

932
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:22,400
And the lema tells us that the cardality

933
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:24,559
of lxe the row covering number of lxe

934
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,680
is at least

935
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,079
row to the minus s minus epsilon. So row

936
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,640
to the minus s is what we get just from

937
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,480
being a row sc set. But actually has to

938
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,000
be a little bit bigger than that by our

939
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,760
lema.

940
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,760
And that's true for every row.

941
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,760
And now since since we have a uniform

942
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,760
set

943
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,200
and since these row covering numbers are

944
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,920
a little bit bigger than expected tells

945
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:59,880
us that lxe

946
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,880
is a delta s plus epsilon c set.

947
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,839
Yeah, actually I should here I needed to

948
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,920
put 0 is less than s is less than the

949
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,400
minimum of e1.

950
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,480
We used all of these are hypotheses of

951
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:19,280
our lema. So we use them here.

952
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:24,119
Okay. Now this is our starting

953
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,119
hypothesis. So now we can iterate.

954
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,200
[Applause]

955
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,040
So s keeps getting bigger and bigger as

956
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,440
long as it's smaller than the minimum of

957
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,400
u and one. And so it will approach the

958
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,400
minimum of u and one

959
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,880
and then we're happy.

960
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,240
Okay.

961
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:57,040
So unlike in the proof of beex theorem

962
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,440
we had to use this lama many times. We

963
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,119
used it at many different scales and

964
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,640
also we had to use it over and over

965
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,559
again and each time we used it we

966
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,200
improved this exponent a little bit

967
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,119
until the exponent approached the

968
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,599
exponent that we had in the classical

969
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,839
vest.

970
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,079
And so this is sort of typical of this

971
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,000
new paradigm that you can take an

972
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,920
epsilon improvement result and use it

973
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,680
over and over again to keep epsilon

974
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,520
improving something until the thing

975
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,640
reaches the sharp value.

976
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:31,040
Okay. Now you might be wondering how we

977
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,960
started this argument. We needed to

978
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,800
start with an S that was bigger than

979
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,960
zero. And not every set is a delta SC c

980
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,960
set for any s.

981
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:47,280
Um so to start the argument

982
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,520
we observe um that we had this

983
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,520
non-conentration in rectangles

984
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,520
condition.

985
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,839
on concentration and rectangles

986
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,079
condition here that our set is not too

987
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,599
much in any rectangle.

988
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,640
We haven't mentioned that hypothesis

989
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:04,720
yet. We use it here to get started. So

990
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,920
to start with

991
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:13,490
non-conentration in rectangles uh easily

992
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:16,780
implies that lxe is a delta ad set.

993
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,780
[Applause]

994
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:27,680
Um because so if E looks like so there's

995
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:30,880
not too much of E in any rectangle

996
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:33,760
is our X. Therefore there aren't too

997
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,079
many of these rectangles too much. You

998
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,760
can't have if you had a lot of lxe in a

999
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,240
small angular range it would mean you

1000
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:44,200
had a lot of E in a small rectangle. And

1001
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,200
that says this doesn't happen.

1002
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,760
Okay cool. So now we have sketched the

1003
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,800
proof of the continuum beex theorem the

1004
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,160
first sharp theorem in projection theory

1005
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,240
distinguishing R from C. So let's take a

1006
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,040
take a couple minutes to digest see if

1007
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,040
you have questions or comments.

1008
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,839
Yeah.

1009
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:32,720
>> On the uh I guess kind of the second

1010
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:35,119
step of proof would be Lexe row is that

1011
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,119
the intersection of LXE with a kind of

1012
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:44,400
row radius ball or

1013
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:46,559
>> sorry. Um so lxe e row is the row

1014
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,400
neighborhood

1015
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:52,079
of lx. Actually you can also you can

1016
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,240
also erase the row. Maybe that's the

1017
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,920
best thing to do.

1018
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,400
Okay. So lxe is a delta SC set and if

1019
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,680
it's uniform it's also a row SC set for

1020
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:07,440
all the bigger rows for row delta

1021
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:11,839
>> for yeah for all row. Yeah.

1022
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,760
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

1023
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,559
Yeah.

1024
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,400
Okay. Yeah. So, so recap. So, we don't

1025
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,760
so we don't Yeah. We don't we don't need

1026
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,319
to mention the right. So, so say it

1027
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,799
again. So, LXE is is uniform set. If

1028
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,760
it's delta SC, then it's also row SC for

1029
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:33,440
all the bigger rows. And so, then we get

1030
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,079
these covering numbers and then get

1031
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,640
okay. Okay. So let me share a personal

1032
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,160
reaction. So when this paper came out

1033
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,920
first of all I was very impressed

1034
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,440
because it was you know I had been

1035
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,839
wondering about this for many years and

1036
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,760
it's the first sharp projection type

1037
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:52,400
theorem which distinguishes R from C.

1038
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
But I also

1039
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,559
felt kind of unsure whether this would

1040
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,520
open the door to prove sharp results for

1041
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,359
things like the first set problem. Uh

1042
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,040
maybe it's a sharp result but maybe it's

1043
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,760
about a kind of thing that somehow is

1044
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,319
more approachable. It was well known

1045
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,640
classically that a epsilon improvement

1046
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,559
of something implied a sharp version of

1047
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,400
the class of the incidence geometry

1048
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,079
something here and that's just not the

1049
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,839
case for semary trotder. Sem ready

1050
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,720
trotder is not known to follow from an

1051
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:25,040
epsilon improvement on on some classical

1052
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,559
thing. Um and so it wasn't clear to me

1053
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,240
if this would open the door to prove

1054
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,200
sharp theorems about all the things we

1055
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,240
most cared about.

1056
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:37,599
All right. Um so in the rest of this

1057
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,319
class what I want to do is to uh give a

1058
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:43,200
give a outline of the proof of the of

1059
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,200
the of the first set conjecture and the

1060
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,480
different ingredients that go into it of

1061
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,880
which this will turn out to be an

1062
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,559
important one.

1063
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,240
Okay,

1064
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:57,599
cool. So the the first thing to say is

1065
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:01,200
that this proof breaks into cases

1066
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:04,880
according to the way the the set E is

1067
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,720
spaced that this del this delta TC set

1068
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,799
that definition on the one hand it's a

1069
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,079
good definition but under the umbrella

1070
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:13,680
of delta TC sets there are several diff

1071
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,920
quite different ways that the set E

1072
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,520
could be spaced and we have to pay

1073
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,880
attention to them and we have to treat

1074
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:25,880
them in different ways.

1075
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,880
All right. So, let's explain that.

1076
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:48,520
So, we're going to split into cases

1077
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,520
according

1078
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:55,319
to how

1079
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,319
E is spaced.

1080
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,680
All right. So first of all, let's assume

1081
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,760
that E is uniform.

1082
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,520
And I'll now I mentioned the word

1083
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,160
uniform above, but now I'll remember

1084
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,720
recall exactly what is uniform.

1085
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,359
Okay. So first of all, our delta is

1086
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,920
going to be

1087
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,799
capital delta to the M where M is a

1088
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:24,799
large number.

1089
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:29,119
And uniform means that for every J going

1090
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:32,559
from one up to M and for every Q which

1091
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:35,200
is a delta to the J cub.

1092
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:39,200
Then when I take my set and I intersect

1093
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,599
it with Q and I cover it with cubes or

1094
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:49,040
balls at the next smaller scale delta to

1095
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:52,040
the J + one. Um that is is around RJ. So

1096
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,040
um

1097
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:11,200
so I'll draw some pictures in a moment.

1098
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:14,160
The smallest this RJ could be is one and

1099
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,960
the biggest it could be is big delta to

1100
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,960
the minus2.

1101
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,960
Oh

1102
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,960
um

1103
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:32,400
actually yeah let me say a little bit

1104
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:36,640
more. So the delta covering number of v

1105
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:40,520
that's going to be the product j = 1 to

1106
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,520
m of rj.

1107
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:49,760
Um and another thing we we can say is if

1108
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:53,440
I if I were to take the product J equals

1109
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:57,359
1 to capital J of RJ that would be the

1110
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:59,440
covering number of E at scale delta to

1111
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:04,000
the capital J

1112
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:06,400
and that should be so

1113
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:12,240
um let's say so

1114
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:16,960
so if E is a deltat TC

1115
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:21,040
Then this should be at least 1 / C um

1116
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,640
delta J to the minus.

1117
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,839
So that gives some information about

1118
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:29,040
these products and

1119
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:31,119
being a delta TC set is equivalent to

1120
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,559
this information about these products.

1121
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,480
And so there are many ways that they

1122
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,240
could look.

1123
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,240
Okay, let me put up a couple of examples

1124
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,000
which also should hopefully clarify

1125
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,400
everything on this board and then we

1126
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,400
pause for questions.

1127
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:51,079
[Applause]

1128
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,079
All right.

1129
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,200
Okay. So the first example that I want

1130
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,280
to put up

1131
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:18,960
is that all the RJs are the same. So RJ

1132
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:22,240
is delta to the minus T for every J.

1133
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:26,760
Okay. And then you'll

1134
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,760
see that this this will be okay.

1135
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:33,319
Um all right. And I'd like to visualize

1136
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,319
this in two ways.

1137
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,720
So the first way I'd like to visualize

1138
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:44,559
is as a tree. Um so oh in my

1139
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:50,880
visualization I picked that delta is

1140
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:53,839
four. Delt no delta is uh 16. Um and no

1141
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:57,839
sorry del sorry delta is one pointer and

1142
01:02:53,839 --> 01:03:01,760
we and t is going to be one.

1143
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:03,920
Okay. So in in my visualization delta to

1144
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:08,240
the minus one is going to be four. I'm

1145
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,640
going to have tree. So that be r1 guys

1146
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:14,799
coming out of it. And then each of these

1147
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:17,039
have r2 which is also four uh uh

1148
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:19,119
branches coming out. I won't draw that

1149
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,559
but they're all the same.

1150
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:26,960
Okay. Now let's do the next stage of our

1151
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:29,200
visualization. We started with a square.

1152
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,920
and we cut it into smaller squares of

1153
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,680
side length delta. So that looked like

1154
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,480
this.

1155
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:40,240
This is stage one

1156
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:44,280
and r sub one is four. So we took four.

1157
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,280
So maybe this one.

1158
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:53,720
Okay. Stage two.

1159
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:53,720
inside of each of those four squares.

1160
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,160
I took each of them and I cut them into

1161
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,119
a 4x4 grid of smaller squares. And I

1162
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,839
took four of them. So I'll do the

1163
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,599
cutting carefully here. Right. So maybe

1164
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,319
I took

1165
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,000
those four and then down here I took

1166
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:17,920
four

1167
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:21,319
and over here I took four and over here

1168
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,319
I took four.

1169
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,640
So our set looks something like that at

1170
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,599
stage two in a new

1171
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:34,720
All right. So this is the first example.

1172
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:36,799
It's called the ad regular example.

1173
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,319
Alforce devided regular. Alforce and

1174
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,400
Devid are two people who worked on stuff

1175
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,799
that is related to this. And the word

1176
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,039
regular I think here refers to the fact

1177
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,039
that all the scales are the same as each

1178
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,039
other.

1179
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,599
Okay.

1180
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:54,599
Now let me show you an opposite extreme.

1181
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,240
Okay. So this one is called the well

1182
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:25,680
spaced example.

1183
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:29,280
So in the well spaced example, RJ is as

1184
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:32,160
big as it could be its maximum value for

1185
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:39,000
some range of J

1186
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:39,000
and then RJ is one for larger of J.

1187
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,559
Okay. So as a picture it would look like

1188
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:51,599
this. So we're going to visualize

1189
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:53,839
with uh big J is one, big F is two like

1190
01:05:51,599 --> 01:06:00,559
over there. So we'll have two stages.

1191
01:05:53,839 --> 01:06:05,039
And so our first stage is that R1 is 16.

1192
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:07,440
Draw it off. And then R2 is one. So from

1193
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,000
each uh point here, we have just one

1194
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,079
going down.

1195
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,400
So the tree looks like this instead of

1196
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,720
like that. A lot of branching at the

1197
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,240
beginning and then no branching after

1198
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,160
that.

1199
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,839
Okay. What does it mean? Our set looks

1200
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:26,720
like in space. Well, first stage one, I

1201
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:30,880
take my square and I break it into 16

1202
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:34,240
squares of side length a quarter.

1203
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:39,000
And at stage one, I select all 16 of

1204
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,000
them. So the picture looks like this.

1205
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,079
Okay, now at stage two.

1206
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,799
So I have cut my square into 16 squares

1207
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,160
of side length a quarter and I look

1208
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:56,960
inside each one of them. I cut that into

1209
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,039
16 squares a smaller size and I pick one

1210
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,400
of them

1211
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:04,000
and I do that in all in all the ones I

1212
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:08,240
selected at stage one which is all of

1213
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,240
them. So this set looks like this.

1214
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,400
Okay,

1215
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:23,039
so this is called the well spaced set.

1216
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,440
So I could fix a t. I can make a delta t

1217
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,160
well spaced. I can fix t and delta. I

1218
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:31,760
can make a delta t wellspace set or I

1219
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:33,520
can make a delta t alph4's regular set.

1220
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,319
And they look rather different from each

1221
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,960
other. And there's also a gray area in

1222
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:43,599
between.

1223
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:46,720
Um so this one is distinguished by

1224
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:50,520
saying that the points

1225
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,520
are the most separated.

1226
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,920
So if these points were like electrons

1227
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,920
that were sitting in this ball and they

1228
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,200
repel each other, they would come to a

1229
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,319
position that's sort of like this. It

1230
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:05,440
would be well spaced.

1231
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:10,079
And this one is distinguished by being

1232
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:13,200
this is the most clumped

1233
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:18,000
which is allowed

1234
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:20,000
for a delta t set.

1235
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,600
So this isn't the most clumped possible

1236
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,120
set. I could take these delta balls. I

1237
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,319
could smoosh them all there. That would

1238
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,319
be more clumped. But if it's a delta t

1239
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,000
set, it's not allowed to do that. And

1240
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,199
this is the most clumped that it could

1241
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,279
be.

1242
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:36,279
subject to the definition of a delta t

1243
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,279
sub.

1244
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,239
Okay, cool. So,

1245
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,319
so there's a range of spacing conditions

1246
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:45,279
um and and this hopefully gives a sample

1247
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,359
of Yeah.

1248
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,960
>> Is there some sort of like energy

1249
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:51,279
condition or kind of quantitative

1250
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,640
measure of the clumping that would kind

1251
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,679
of allow you to separate the two cases

1252
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,359
because they're both delta SC,

1253
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,359
>> right? So the question is there is there

1254
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,279
a quantitative measure of clumping or

1255
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,560
concentrating or spacing that would

1256
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:08,880
allow us to distinguish them? Um I I

1257
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:13,359
think the nicest way to do that is this

1258
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:16,319
list of RJS or perhaps this list of uh

1259
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:19,600
this list of these numbers here. Yeah.

1260
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,679
So it's not just a single number, but it

1261
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,239
is quantitative. And if you're willing

1262
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,759
to have, you know, like a a list of

1263
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:28,000
numbers describing your set, then it

1264
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:31,040
does quite a good job.

1265
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,920
Um, it's really a modern innovation to

1266
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,759
focus on that. In in previous times,

1267
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,520
people wanted to describe the spacing of

1268
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,000
their set with one number, which would

1269
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,199
be like the dimension of the set or the

1270
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,920
energy or something. Um, and when they

1271
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:47,920
were describing with just one number,

1272
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,239
then it was lumping together these two

1273
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:54,080
rather different behaviors. And it turns

1274
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:56,000
out to be important to unlump them um

1275
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:59,719
for to prove this theorem at least with

1276
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,719
the proof that we have.

1277
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:09,800
Okay, good. Uh, okay. So now I can write

1278
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:09,800
down the outline of the proof.

1279
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,520
Okay,

1280
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,120
so here is the outline of the proof of

1281
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,679
the main theorem or let me say of the

1282
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,679
first conjecture

1283
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,600
first.

1284
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,719
Okay,

1285
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,719
so first main ingredient

1286
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,480
is a theorem of Borpin and a Schwarin

1287
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,560
from 24

1288
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:17,400
and they proved that the Fenberg

1289
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:17,400
conjecture holds in the ad regular case.

1290
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Okay, so this is based on it builds on

1291
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,960
the stuff builds on the stuff we talked

1292
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,600
about today. So it builds on the

1293
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:39,520
continuum bec theorem of OSW which in

1294
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:43,679
turn built on the epsilon improvement

1295
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:47,640
of uh or OS which in turn built on the

1296
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,640
BAN projection theorem.

1297
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,400
All right, it's not at all obvious given

1298
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,120
the Beck theorem, just an ingredient.

1299
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,120
Um, and um, so there also some great

1300
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,719
ideas in that that we'll talk about next

1301
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,560
time. But also it involves some special

1302
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:08,840
structure

1303
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,840
of the AD regular case.

1304
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,719
Okay, we'll talk about that a lot uh on

1305
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,040
Thursday.

1306
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:24,400
All right, the second ingredient is a

1307
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,400
theorem of Guth Solomon Wong. So I was

1308
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,440
involved a little bit. This a slightly

1309
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,199
older theorem. It's from 2019

1310
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,159
and we proved that the first invert

1311
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:37,159
conjecture holds in the well spaced

1312
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,159
case.

1313
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:44,679
Okay. And it's based on the forier

1314
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,679
method.

1315
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,600
Okay, this is much less difficult than

1316
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,440
this. It's the 4A method that we

1317
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,760
explored for a while with a little bit

1318
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,120
of extra something something. How do you

1319
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:02,000
take advantage of being really well

1320
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:04,400
spaced instead of just ad regular

1321
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:10,920
okay

1322
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:10,920
good. All right. So now um

1323
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,760
when I presented these two possibilities

1324
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,080
it the way I had thought about them is

1325
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,800
that these are just two opposite ends of

1326
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,640
a whole gray spectrum.

1327
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,159
And so if you have a method that works

1328
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,280
in one end and you have a method that

1329
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:31,440
works on the other end,

1330
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,960
I guess you might hope to have a general

1331
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,600
thing that sort of combines them both

1332
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,960
and and works for everything. But um but

1333
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,440
there's still all this stuff in the

1334
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,320
middle.

1335
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,760
Um and it turns out I think this is

1336
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,679
surprising and important in its own

1337
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,520
right that the proof of the theorem

1338
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:53,199
actually reduces to just those two cases

1339
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:57,640
or or um so the third ingredient

1340
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,640
is a multiscale argument

1341
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,640
which shows that the first conjecture

1342
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:10,400
actually reduces to

1343
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:14,719
the ad regular case and the what they

1344
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:17,360
call the semi wellspaced case.

1345
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,440
So this is a small generalization of

1346
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,199
this case that can be handled by more or

1347
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:24,199
less the same methods using for

1348
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,199
analysis.

1349
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:30,840
Okay. Um

1350
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,840
cool.

1351
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,199
Okay. So in in each of these I think

1352
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,679
there is something worth talking about

1353
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,679
and worth worth remembering an idea that

1354
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,800
could be useful in other in other pro

1355
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:44,960
certainly in other problems in this

1356
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,080
field and maybe in other parts of math.

1357
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,880
Uh we have two more classes so I'll

1358
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,320
vigil and wiggle and so my goal is in

1359
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,480
the two classes to say something

1360
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,719
substantial about each of these three

1361
01:14:54,480 --> 01:15:00,280
ideas which fit together to prove the

1362
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,280
first and third conjecture.

1363
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:11,640
Okay, good. Any question la last

1364
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,640
questions or comments?

1365
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,960
>> Mhm.

1366
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:18,400
>> Within kind of each of these individual

1367
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,800
cases like how kind of much variation is

1368
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,159
there in the structure of the sets? Like

1369
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,640
I guess it's not going to be kind of

1370
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:27,600
rearranging kind of certain points

1371
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:30,159
within kind of one of the boxes does a

1372
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:33,040
lot or does a little

1373
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:35,840
Yeah. Okay. So the question is we've t

1374
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,360
so we've taken all the delta t sets we

1375
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,760
have then divided them according to

1376
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,760
their branching function and one extreme

1377
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,280
is the ad regular and one extreme is the

1378
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,800
wellspaced

1379
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,719
and then the question is if you look

1380
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,400
among different sets with the same

1381
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:51,520
branching function like among different

1382
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:55,360
ad regular sets how different are they

1383
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:58,360
from each other? Um

1384
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,360
well

1385
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,719
[Applause]

1386
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,360
uh I will try to sort of answer that by

1387
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,760
drawing a second ad regular set in blue

1388
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,880
that we can compare to the one in white.

1389
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:18,280
So I should pick four uh big squares and

1390
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,280
in each of them I'll draw four dots.

1391
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,080
Um

1392
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:33,840
um

1393
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,800
I would say that the sort of

1394
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,719
spacing feel of these dots is is the

1395
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,440
same in all the examples that are ad

1396
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,120
regular. Um on the other hand actually

1397
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:47,320
let me draw another example. So this

1398
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:47,320
this would be here's another example.

1399
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,840
So

1400
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:06,000
something else is a little different

1401
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:07,760
about this example. Um and so yeah, so

1402
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,280
there are some more delicate things that

1403
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,719
could be different about the different

1404
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,000
ad regular examples. Even though so so

1405
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,159
what's the same about them is you give

1406
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,760
me a radius your favorite radius you

1407
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,679
stick down a ball of that radius and

1408
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:25,320
count how many points are in there that

1409
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,320
will be the same for any a dregular set

1410
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:32,080
but there are delicate things actually

1411
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,560
another very important delicate thing

1412
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,560
that would be different is so for let's

1413
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,080
now think about the well spaced set an

1414
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,640
example of a well spaced set is an

1415
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,640
integer grid

1416
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,960
that has some special properties. It has

1417
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,840
like translation symmetry and stuff like

1418
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,280
that. A typical well spaced set will

1419
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,520
still have one point in each of these

1420
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,960
boxes, but it won't have additive

1421
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,679
structure. It won't have translation

1422
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:58,000
symmetry. It won't have and it won't

1423
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,320
have uh you know very many lines that go

1424
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,560
through many points. So those kinds of

1425
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:07,000
things are different among the different

1426
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,000
sets with the same spacing condition.

1427
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,000
Uh okay. Well, let's stop there for

1428
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:16,440
today and we'll talk more about these

1429
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,440
things on our last two classes.
