1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,839
So welcome to this edition of the broad

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,720
MIT uh seminar series. Um I wish to

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,000
thank our sponsors and uh also professor

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,000
Ed Sknick for endowing this seminar

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,279
series. Um so thank you Ed for your

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,680
continued support and leadership. And so

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
today it's a privilege to introduce

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
professor Nathaniel Gray who doesn't

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,320
really need an introduction to this

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,960
community. Um Nat is a Krishnan Sha

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,160
professor family professor at uh of

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
chemical and systems biology at Stanford

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
and he's also a member of the chem

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,800
there. Um Nat received his bachelor's

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,520
and doctoral degrees from University of

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,000
uh California at Berkeley and there he

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,120
developed these combinatorial um uh

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,280
platforms and functional genomics

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,600
approaches and that yielded uh pervenol

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,559
that's one of the uh one of the early

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,840
selective inhibitors of um cycl

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,239
dependent cycl dependent kynases and

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,280
then following his PhD Nat went on to

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,439
work at Novartis and there he his team

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,240
developed the um allesteric the first

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,200
alleic inhibitors of BCR aable that you

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,840
know resulted in the drug aim and then

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,240
also uh the alk inhibitor that resulted

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,920
in a drug

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,240
serotonin nat started his lab at Dana

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,000
Farber in 2006 and there also he has

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,400
developed a lot of firstin-class

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,920
pharmacological agents

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,200
uh just to name a few uh his work

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
particularly on targeting these

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,079
gatekeeper mutations in kynases has elia

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,479
drugs like osmortnib

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,680
and punat and and and then today Nat is

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,640
going to talk about a completely

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,200
different u space about molecular glues

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
and transcriptional

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,840
reprogramming. Um so NAT has received a

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,799
lot of awards uh including NSF's career

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
award, Damon Rener Damon Renan's uh

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
foundation's innovator award and more

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
recently the Paul Mars prize. Uh please

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
join me in welcoming

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,320
Nat. Thank you so much for that uh kind

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,840
introduction. Thanks for coming to spend

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,680
your afternoon uh here to listen to our

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,599
science. So yeah, I'm going to talk a

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
little bit about uh chemically induced

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,560
proximity. I'll start off with a

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,560
introduction regarding um degradation

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,760
and then sort of show how we evolved it

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
to transcription factor uh

57
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,040
reprogramming. Uh these are my uh

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,160
disclosures. The ones in in red are the

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,080
most relevant to uh today.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
So I think if you look across the

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,280
therapeutic uh landscape, you know, one

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,800
observation I've made is that uh as you

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,280
evolve sort of fundamentally new uh ways

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
to tweak uh nature, you fundamentally

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
get different uh mechanisms at play. And

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
I think one of the things we can do uh

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,000
best in in academia is to try to

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,360
increase, you know, what's on the menu

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,360
here for uh different uh approaches. And

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
I think we're we're gradually seeing

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,239
more and more intricate ways that we can

72
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,400
uh manipulate uh nature to affect uh

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,720
therapeutic uh ends. So what I'm going

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
to talk mostly today about is this uh

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,519
final box. So proximity therapeutics. So

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,319
what is what is proximity therapeutics?

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,959
It's therapeutics where you get the

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,440
pharmacological effect not by inhibition

79
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,440
of A or B but through a new function

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,519
created by the unnatural uh union of two

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,680
uh proteins. And one of the major

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,920
advantages of proximity therapeutics is

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,480
that new function that you can get may

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
not be predicated on either the function

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,920
of A or function of B. It really can be

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,000
a denovo uh function. A second advantage

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,040
is even though I've drawn the sort of

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,360
equal binding to each side often times

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,319
these molecular glues will primarily

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,840
bind to one protein and then induce a

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,920
protein protein interaction with a

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
second protein. That means that the

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
second protein doesn't need to be

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
naturally druggable. May not have a

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,280
drug-like uh binding pocket. And of

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,959
course, this goes back to um mother

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599
nature that's already taught us that

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,000
this is a very powerful way of inducing

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,200
uh new protein function. So many natural

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,040
products will act as molecular glues and

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
often targeting things that historically

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,400
been very difficult to target. So for

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
example, seminal work targeting

104
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,639
calcinurine which remains a very

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,120
challenging target for small molecules

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,840
but very well uh targeted via this

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,639
molecular gluing approach. So what we're

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,880
trying to achieve is a molecular glue

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
that will lead to a gain of function of

110
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,360
the target gain of function of perhaps

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,240
the other protein uh and fundamentally

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,360
new pharmarmacology. So the first system

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,320
where this was sort of discovered was in

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,960
the molecular uh glue uh degrader either

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,000
with bveillance or monovalent glues

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,639
where the idea is to induce a new

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,639
substrate interaction with an E3 ligase

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,960
to get ubiquitation and protein uh

119
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,320
degradation. So um about 10 years ago

120
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,720
when we started this work in

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,880
collaboration with uh Jay's lab we

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
started thinking about uh what are the

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
the key features of these molecules that

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,639
are going to be fundamentally uh

125
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,919
different from a traditional occupancy

126
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,680
driven inhibitor right where you're

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
looking at resonance time you're

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
primarily looking at inhibition of an

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,919
enzyatic activity you often have to

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
maintain high drug levels to maintain

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,440
full occupancy in contrast these

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
proximity based methods are event driven

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,320
so you're simply trying to have a

134
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,199
molecule induce a productive interaction

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,000
and then if the function comes from the

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,919
enzyatic activity of one partner you can

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
have turnover. So in this case uh

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,759
degradation of B84 induced by

139
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,560
recruitment of a cereblon liase and then

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,560
the pharmarmacology is controlled by uh

141
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
how the system responds to loss of

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,320
protein function and then the only way

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
the system can restore function is

144
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
through protein reynthesis. So in the

145
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,240
case of degraders, how quickly the

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
protein comes back really can predicate

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,919
uh how quickly uh the system will

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,960
restore itself. And so the index case

149
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,800
for this was uh an initial degrader made

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,199
by Jeanji JQ1 uh then elaborated by

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,080
Dennis Buckley into this compound, a

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,400
very efficient degrader of uh BRD4. And

153
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,800
this was really uh impressive because

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,360
before this uh discovery people had

155
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,680
proposed this type of molecule um but

156
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
they were typically active at very high

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
concentration. So people really thought

158
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
about this as sort of a chemical biology

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,759
ploy. But here you can see even this

160
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,160
initial molecule at 100 nanomolar uh

161
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919
leading to very potent uh degradation

162
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
and this gave a lot of credence to the

163
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,199
idea that maybe therapeutically relevant

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,160
degraders uh could be synthesized. So I

165
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,639
think um for those of you who are not so

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
familiar with degraders here are uh five

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,600
things that are really uh unique about

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,479
degraders that have uh garnered you know

169
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,479
huge interest in this modality. So one

170
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
is you can get really high target

171
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,720
selectivity. So why is that? That's

172
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
because you combine not only the usual

173
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,560
features of small molecule protein

174
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
recognition but you're inducing a new

175
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,720
protein protein interaction. And so if

176
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
there's differences between the protein

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
interface between protein A and protein

178
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
B that can be exploited by the small

179
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,199
molecule. So you're combining both the

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
the protein level selectivity and the

181
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,400
lian level selectivity uh to get

182
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,800
targeted degradation. Furthermore,

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,880
because the inhibitors are uh not

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
occupancy based, they actually can

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,039
overcome many point mutationbased

186
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,080
resistance mechanisms where the point

187
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,720
mutation might induce a 10% or 10-fold

188
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
decrease in in um occupancy, but you can

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,039
still get enough turnary complex

190
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,039
formation to get uh degradation. You're

191
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,599
also eliminating the scaffolding

192
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,319
function uh of the uh protein uh which

193
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,080
can lead to unique and interesting

194
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,400
polypharmacological effects.

195
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,639
Many times the recruited protein may not

196
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,479
have a binding pocket as itself.

197
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,759
Therefore, you can go after undruggable

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,599
targets. There are several examples of

199
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
that in the literature. And then just

200
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,000
like a coalent inhibitor because it's an

201
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,319
event driven pharmarmacology, you can

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,039
also have a very different PK profile

203
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,400
PKPD profile relative to an occupancy

204
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,759
based um you know inhibitor. So right

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,759
now in the field there sort of two

206
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,800
general flavors of compounds. are what

207
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,039
are called heterobivalent or or protac

208
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,960
type compounds where primarily the

209
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,520
difference is these are created by you

210
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,319
know by chemists by uh linking a

211
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,479
targeting liant via linker to an E3

212
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,880
recruiting moyad. These molecules will

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,200
often show a hook-like uh behavior in

214
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,360
their pharmacology where a single small

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
molecule binds separately to the two

216
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,159
targets. This is in contrast to a

217
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,720
molecular glue where the biochemical

218
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,279
definition is that the glue has higher

219
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,600
affinity in the turnary complex. And the

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,839
advantage of course with these molecules

221
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,160
is they're often smaller uh more

222
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,000
drug-like and easier to develop. Despite

223
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
that, many people have successfully

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,160
developed uh compounds with suitable uh

225
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,279
properties for clinical development from

226
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,000
heterobiovalence as well. So our first

227
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,560
foray uh into this area uh was

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,160
developing uh kynise degraders. And so

229
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,080
initially we tried to degrade some of

230
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,720
our favorite uh kynise targets and we

231
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
ran into trouble. So we decided to try a

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,040
sort of promiscuous pathf finding

233
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
approach where we made intentionally uh

234
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,760
promiscuous degraders. We took very

235
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,080
generic uh kinase binders. We linked

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,600
them via linkers to E3 recruiters. And

237
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,760
then in collaboration with Katherine

238
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,800
Donovan and Eric Fischer at the Farber

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,920
who are our lab neighbors, we use

240
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,600
chemoproteics to figure out which

241
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,120
kinases were um uh degraded. And one of

242
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,080
the seminal findings from this study

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,880
where we profiled several hundred uh

244
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,279
kynise degraders was that many of the

245
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,880
best kynise degraders didn't actually

246
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,640
start from the cognate lian uh for that

247
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
kynise. So you know up until this point

248
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
sort of the favorite way of making a

249
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,440
protag was you know take your best

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,279
inhibitor of the kynise then make a

251
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
degrader from that. But what we

252
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,200
discovered from this schemopomics

253
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,360
approach is oftentimes things that were

254
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,120
well degraded were actually very weak

255
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
affinity targets of the initial

256
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,519
targeting lian. So for example the

257
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,839
satinib a very potent sarkc family and

258
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,399
able family kinus inhibitor as a

259
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,120
degrader is very selective and potent

260
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,279
for c terminal sarcinace. So this lookup

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
table became a very powerful way of

262
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
finding good starting points for making

263
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,880
degraders of uh favorite kynise targets

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,800
and and and our lab together with many

265
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,959
people in the field have now made a

266
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,120
whole inventory of compounds that can

267
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,959
degrade all sorts of different kinases

268
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,200
either selectively or in a um polyynise

269
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,000
fashion of degrading two three four or

270
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,560
five uh kinases and this has sort of

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,720
sparked a big interest now uh in the

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,440
field several biotech companies got

273
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,959
started uh and many pharma companies

274
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
also invested heavily in this

275
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,440
technology. Uh this is actually from an

276
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
old review article, but there's at least

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
15 different uh compounds now in

278
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,720
clinical trials and hopefully uh we're

279
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,120
going to see um some of these be uh FDA

280
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
approved. So here are some of the key

281
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
milestones I think in the field that

282
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
we're we're waiting on is you know

283
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,440
regulatory approval of the first

284
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,800
rationally uh developed the

285
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,959
greater um there's been some

286
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,320
conservatism. so far in the targets that

287
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,800
have been degraded. So there's been a

288
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,040
lot of work on targets like ER and AR

289
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,959
that we already know are good targets.

290
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
But to me the most exciting thing is to

291
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,240
be able to derug things that were

292
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,399
previously undruggable. There's some

293
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
examples of that now in the clinic. One

294
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,320
of the promises of the technology is to

295
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,880
be able to achieve tissue specific

296
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
pharmarmacology by uh recruiting liases

297
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
that are tissue specific in their

298
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,120
expression. There's also quite a bit of

299
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
work to expand to non-oncology

300
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,480
indications and then there's work to

301
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,120
generate targeting agents where you for

302
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,720
example conjugate a degraater molecule

303
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,640
onto an antibbody. So you use the

304
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,959
antibbody to target to a cell surface

305
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,360
receptor and then you have the uh

306
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
antibbody get internalized to deliver a

307
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,640
degrader to make a sort of a

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,760
polypharmacological

309
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,360
uh uh agent that can achieve tissue

310
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,000
selectivity.

311
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,800
So uh really one of the the limitations

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,720
of that protac uh approach is that

313
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,959
you're often looking for your keys under

314
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,600
the lampost because it often starts with

315
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,279
a binder uh first approach and so people

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
are starting from uh targets where

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,880
there's already uh ligans. So we started

318
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,680
thinking is there another way of of

319
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,560
discovering um novel degraders and so

320
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,920
several folks uh in our lab decided that

321
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,880
maybe we can sort of take what we

322
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,920
calling a a degon display approach. So

323
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,880
if we start uh from a protein uh binder

324
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,279
but we simply want to go fishing for

325
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,000
appropriate liases. So in our genomes

326
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,320
there's over 500 different liases and

327
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,720
for most of the liases we don't actually

328
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,800
know what their endogenous degron is. we

329
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
don't actually know what they recognize

330
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,519
as being messed up. So we we know some

331
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,920
deg are are phosphorilation sites or

332
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,600
proline hydroxilation but in many cases

333
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,600
we don't actually know what that

334
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,959
deg could we simply go fishing uh for

335
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,399
targets that would be um uh

336
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,800
degraded. And so one of the fish hooks

337
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,519
that we looked at initially were uh

338
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,360
simply trying to expose a heterosyclic

339
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,360
system at the protein surface or expose

340
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
an electrophile. And so we know that

341
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
electrophiles can get generated on

342
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
protein surfaces from you know

343
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,519
tyrrosines or tryptophans through

344
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,920
oxidative processes. So we hypothesized

345
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,160
that there might be liases that would

346
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,399
have evolved to recognize uh

347
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,959
electrophiles to eliminate uh that

348
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,200
protein function. And I'll show you now

349
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,839
three quick uh vignettes for um degrons

350
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,839
that we discovered that were either

351
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,959
covealent electrostatic or involved pi

352
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,680
uh cation uh interactions. So Z in the

353
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,079
lab initially started um looking at a

354
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,000
pending deg

355
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,560
uh JQ1. So JQ1 is a binder of BRD4 and

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
BRD4 is a very easy protein uh to

357
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,880
degrade. It has a lot of lysines and

358
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,959
once ubiquitated it's very efficiently

359
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,560
eliminated and so we built a library of

360
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,399
these fish hooks either these

361
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
heterosycles or these types of

362
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,000
electroiles. So this is an electrophile

363
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,560
that will form a shift base with a

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,760
lysine. Here's one that'll undergo an SN

365
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,639
aerial uh type reaction or an isolation

366
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,480
reaction uh and looked for compounds

367
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,560
that could efficiently degrade uh

368
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:41,040
BRD4. And so one compound to emerge from

369
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,920
this uh screen is this ZZ9 compound. So

370
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,160
this compound has a highly electron

371
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,040
deficient aerial system will react with

372
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,480
a thol. And so we initially screen this

373
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,120
library using a B-4 hybrid assay and

374
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
then we can confirmed uh by uh western

375
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,760
blotting. We got some incredibly potent

376
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,519
brood domain degraders. You can see here

377
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,600
down to subnanomar um

378
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,839
potency. And then we confirm once we see

379
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,079
that degradation how selective is it at

380
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,880
a proteomewide level. You can see this

381
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,639
is a very selective degrader of uh bromo

382
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,880
domains. Then um the system that we

383
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,160
typically use to look at degradation is

384
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,720
what's called a hybrid assay. I

385
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,360
mentioned this earlier. Uh so we fuse

386
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,399
BRD4 to a split luciferase system and

387
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
then this can be reconstituted to form a

388
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,920
luciferase. And we can see that this

389
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,680
compound was incredibly uh potent. So

390
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,800
this is a 15 picolar degrader of BRD4

391
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,279
much more potent than these

392
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,600
hetererovalent compounds here at about

393
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,279
21 um nanomer and again completely sort

394
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,120
of serendipitously discovered through

395
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,120
this electrophile uh library

396
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,000
approach. So one of the key features of

397
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,360
these degrader molecules is you know

398
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,920
figuring out you know how they're

399
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,279
binding and what's the selectivity and

400
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,519
so one of the things we often do is

401
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,959
we'll make a negative control. Also here

402
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,800
we invert the stereochemistry of the

403
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,440
benzoazipene type system. Turns out that

404
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,440
completely uh rescues uh the degradation

405
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,279
activity showing that only the the

406
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,279
correct uh binding isomer uh is

407
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:20,320
active. We then uh teamed up with

408
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,920
Benit's lab um together with Susanna and

409
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,639
Mikoloi to try to figure out um what

410
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,560
liases could be responsible for this

411
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,000
degradation. And so what you do here is

412
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,959
you uh look by crisper cast 9 screening

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,759
specifically at which liases can rescue

414
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,759
BRD4 from being degraded and using this

415
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,959
screen we'd identified decaf um 16 as

416
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,000
the relevant liase. So decaf 16 is the

417
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,959
substrate adapter of this cull based

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,440
ligase just like cereablon is. Uh so

419
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,000
here it binds

420
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,800
here we're able to show uh that the

421
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,560
relevant lysine that's reacted in decaf

422
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,160
16 is cyine um 58 and although we didn't

423
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,240
get a crystal structure of this compound

424
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,880
we had an earlier acryumide compound we

425
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,679
got a crystal structure of called mmh2

426
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,720
that forms a covealent bond so it's very

427
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,799
interesting the protein forms a complex

428
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,120
with the liase then the li the ligan

429
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,799
reaches across this interface to form a

430
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,039
coalent bond to 1658 and this is not a

431
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,199
normal sort of electrophile labeling.

432
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
It's actually a templated labeling and

433
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,280
you can see this from this incubation

434
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,640
experiment. So only when you incubate

435
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,640
decaf 16 B4 together with a lian do you

436
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,600
get efficient uh labeling. So just like

437
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,240
a kinase you know will take ATP and then

438
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,160
transfer the phosphate to another

439
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,440
protein. The same thing happens here. uh

440
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,720
the the ligase is receiving the

441
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
electrophile in the context of that PPI

442
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
uh interaction and that's one of the

443
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,840
reasons I think that ends up being such

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,760
a potent degrader is you have a

445
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,160
templating effect uh to get that

446
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,080
efficient uh modification of the uh the

447
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
thol. So here's sort of a cartoon of

448
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,720
what we think is happening. The

449
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,400
molecular glue binds to BD4. You get

450
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,840
this induced protein protein

451
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,880
interaction. you get the uh isolation or

452
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,520
the alkalation of the thol the

453
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,080
modification and then the subsequent um

454
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,000
proteisome mediated degradation of

455
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:27,240
BRD4. So that was the example of of a

456
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,320
covealent deg. What about uh this

457
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,679
potential? So for this one was the same

458
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,520
library uh and so here we were trying to

459
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,240
actually target a different residue.

460
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,919
This is some very nice chemistry um very

461
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,720
old chemistry but recently popularized

462
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,280
by Barry Sharpless's lab for reacting

463
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
with either lysines, tyrrosines or seren

464
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,840
where you can basically get uh

465
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,919
sulfanomids or sulfanate ers. And so we

466
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,360
thought maybe there's liases that will

467
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,320
react specifically uh with this

468
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,840
electrophile. And so we found this

469
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,840
second compound ZZ1 again it's a BRD4

470
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,720
degrader. That's our sentinel protein

471
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,360
for uh degradation. And then again in

472
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,919
collaboration with Zuzanna we discovered

473
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,840
another uh ligase that's a component of

474
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,520
the C terminal LSH liase CTLH ligase and

475
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,000
this component uh WDR 26. So it turns

476
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,000
out this is a very complicated ligase

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,760
and if Brenda Schulman's lab hadn't

478
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
already been working on this we would

479
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,480
have been completely lost in trying to

480
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,039
figure out uh this uh this biology.

481
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,840
Luckily, Yakab Critzoot in her lab had

482
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,760
actually just solved the uh cryomm

483
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
structure of this very complicated

484
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,640
ligase. So, um the chemist description

485
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
of this is a as a giant donut. Uh and so

486
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
you basically have this donut composed

487
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,280
of all these different uh protein

488
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,200
factors and the factor that we thought

489
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,799
we were labeling and was identified from

490
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,480
this crisper screen was this Yel 5

491
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,240
component.

492
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,760
uh and Yakob in Brenda's lab was able to

493
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,679
reconstitute this system and basically

494
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,400
show that with the addition of the

495
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,840
molecular glue only when you combine all

496
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,760
these other um factors uh over here can

497
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,880
you get efficient ubiquitation and then

498
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,200
degradation of the of the

499
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:18,280
protein. We're able to confirm that if

500
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,960
you delete either Yel 5 or

501
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,720
WDR26 that completely rescues uh the

502
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
degradation. So those factors are

503
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,200
essential uh for the degradation. And

504
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,039
then we looked across the dependency map

505
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,679
developed by the broad institute for

506
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,240
cells that were either high or low in

507
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,559
Yel5. And as you can see cells that have

508
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,960
high levels of Yel 5 very efficiently

509
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,640
can degrade Brd4 whereas whether you

510
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,559
have a low expressor then you get kind

511
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,400
of a wimpy uh degradation of

512
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:49,600
BRD4. Then Yaka went on to be able to

513
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,159
solve the cryomm structure of ZZ1

514
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,720
induced neo substrate recognition. And

515
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,840
so essentially what happens is um the

516
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,320
BRD4 neo substrate gets glued by the

517
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,000
small molecule inside the hole of the

518
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,000
donut. Here's a closeup of that

519
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,440
structure. So here's the the molecular

520
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,480
glue ZZ1 sitting there at the interface

521
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,640
gluing BRD4 uh to Yel 5. And then one of

522
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,640
the conundrums was that when we looked

523
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,840
at this cryom structure, we actually

524
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,919
didn't see any bond formation with the

525
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,159
nucleophiles uh here that we had

526
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,320
anticipated. So remember the initial

527
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,440
idea here was to get a nucleophilic

528
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,799
attack onto this electrophile here. And

529
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,159
certainly there's a whole bunch of

530
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,159
electroiles. There's a tyrrosine,

531
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
there's a lysine, there's a histadine,

532
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,360
but we didn't see that bond formation.

533
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,520
And furthermore, when we mutated each of

534
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,760
these residues, none of them uh

535
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,400
prevented the ubiquitation of the uh of

536
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,600
the target. So this was very uh

537
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,200
confusing. And furthermore, we then

538
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,520
incubated BRD4 with the uh ligase and we

539
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
actually didn't see any modification, no

540
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,919
covealent uh modification. And then we

541
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,039
noticed actually that this binding

542
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,720
pocket was actually very um uh basic.

543
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,799
And so we began to hypothesize that

544
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,400
maybe we weren't getting coalent bond

545
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,400
formation. Maybe there was some kind of

546
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,679
an electrostatic interaction but our

547
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,360
electrophile is not charged. So so why

548
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,240
would that be? We then figured out that

549
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,039
actually this kind of a sulfan fluoride

550
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,480
will react with theols. First we tested

551
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:32,799
dio that will actually react with a

552
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,360
theol to generate a sulfinic acid.

553
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,760
And in fact the biologically active

554
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,240
compound was actually not the sulfan

555
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,600
fluoride. It was actually the sulfinic

556
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,200
acid. So we had inadvertently made a

557
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,280
prod drug that in cells gets metabolized

558
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,440
to this negatively charged muy that

559
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,200
interacts now with this uh basic

560
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,200
pocket. Then to corroborate that we

561
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,159
synthesize both the sulfinic acid and

562
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,799
the fully oxidized sulfonic acid. Lo and

563
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,559
behold, those two compounds are actually

564
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:09,919
more potent um uh degraders uh and also

565
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:14,240
uh work in the um oops in the um

566
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
interaction uh assay.

567
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,000
Oops. So here is the chemistry that

568
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,799
takes place. So you basically get an

569
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,840
additional uh thol attack to get this

570
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,840
oxidized dulfide. Then a further thol

571
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
attack comes removes that and that's

572
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
what gives you the the sulfinic esther.

573
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
And this was interesting because

574
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,520
normally chemists are judiciously not

575
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,080
putting negatively charged on their

576
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,919
molecules because you block good cell

577
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,919
penetration. So this was actually an

578
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,919
interesting way of getting a negatively

579
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,840
charged egron into cells. And you can

580
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,240
imagine there's probably a lot of liases

581
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,919
that recognize negative degrons because

582
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,039
for example phosphorilation is very

583
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,799
common very commonly used as a PTM and

584
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,640
there's many proteins that possibly

585
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,520
could recognize phosphorilation and

586
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,400
induce um degradation. So that's sort of

587
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,840
the second uh vignette of a negatively

588
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,799
charged molecular glue. And then for the

589
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,640
pyatine interactions, this is a very uh

590
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,120
common interaction between ligans and

591
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,200
also between uh proteins but is not

592
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,000
often exploited by medicinal chemists

593
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,200
because it's often not as uh directional

594
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and easy to uh predict or to design into

595
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,799
molecules. And for this we were inspired

596
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,279
by this prior um work from Miko and from

597
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,840
Ben and from others um where they

598
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,640
discovered that this CDK inhibitor this

599
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,840
elaborated CDK inhibitor which binds to

600
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,120
a variety of CDKs in including CDK12

601
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,720
actually ends up being a degrader of

602
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,360
cycl K. Okay. And so the way this

603
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,360
molecule works is it reaches across this

604
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,480
protein protein interface and then this

605
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,400
purodal group interacts with an arginine

606
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,640
on DDB1 and then instead of ubiquitating

607
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,400
CDK12 you get ubiquitination of cycl K

608
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,799
and then subsequent degra degradation of

609
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,440
cycl K. So this is what led us to be

610
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,919
inspired that this type of functionality

611
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,799
might be able to serve as a deg. And so

612
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,080
we we elaborated a variety of kynise

613
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,600
scaffolds and we've been working with

614
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,320
this primital system as a CDK binder. So

615
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,960
again Z built a library of uh

616
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,600
electrophile of um modifications at this

617
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,760
position uh making you know both R and S

618
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,080
and antimer compounds and then lo and

619
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,720
behold we found a compound that was a

620
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,480
very good um uh glue between CDK12 and

621
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
uh

622
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,320
DDB1. So you can here you can see very

623
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,679
good uh degradation. So in contrast to

624
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,320
the first example which only degrades

625
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,600
Cycl K, this compound will degrade Cycl

626
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,120
K, CDK12 and

627
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,000
CDK13 and it's completely dependent on

628
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,120
DDB1. If you knock out DDB1, then you

629
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,600
rescue that degradation uh activity. And

630
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,200
we've been able to take that um degron

631
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,279
and actually adapt it to quite a few

632
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,520
different compounds to get interactions

633
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,640
with liases that have this type of an

634
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,039
arginine, not only DB1 but others as a

635
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,279
way of getting a a molecular glue. So

636
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,320
the advantage of this um sort of fish

637
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,960
hook approach is that you actually find

638
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,679
uh novel liases um as opposed to

639
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,360
continual use of cereablon and DHL. And

640
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,880
so we hope that has uh further

641
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,360
advantages as we elaborate uh the

642
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,720
approach. So in the next segment I want

643
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,200
to switch from uh making degraders to

644
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,039
how do we make molecular glues that do

645
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,799
other uh things. And so this was a

646
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,720
project initiated when we started at

647
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,200
Stanford about three years ago in

648
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,960
collaboration with Jerry Crabtree. And

649
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,880
so here the idea was a little bit

650
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,320
different. We wanted to see could we

651
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,440
make a molecular glue that will restore

652
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,000
communication from cancer driving

653
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,400
pathways to the apoptoic pathway. And so

654
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
we know cancer cells judiciously

655
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,799
downregulate communication with

656
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,480
apoptosis to prevent uh cell death. And

657
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,480
so what would happen if we made a

658
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,600
molecular glue that could essentially

659
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,240
glue an ankcoenic transcription factor

660
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,000
into the cell death uh program? And so

661
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,919
the idea was actually quite simple.

662
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,120
We're going to now make a a molecular

663
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,559
glue between a death regulator and a

664
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,000
cancer driving um uh transcription

665
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:20,640
factor. And the transcription factor we

666
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,080
decided to target was BCL6. So BCL6 is a

667
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,440
well well credentialed anka gene in

668
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,720
lymphoma. and it gets upregulated in

669
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,120
lymphoma through um promoter mutations

670
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,400
that simply uh increase its expression

671
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:39,600
level and it's a very powerful repressor

672
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,400
of proapoptoic uh genes through um uh

673
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,279
repression of p-53 noxa and other

674
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,559
proteins. The other reason we chose

675
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:48,720
BCL6, there's there had been a lot of

676
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,279
beautiful prior med efforts from other

677
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,919
groups to try to target BCL6. And what

678
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,399
prior groups had tried to do was drug

679
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,399
this BTB domain. This is a professional

680
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,320
protein protein interaction domain that

681
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,360
normally recruits co-opressor proteins

682
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,480
to BCL6. And so the idea previously had

683
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,440
been let's block the BTB domain, release

684
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,440
these uh co-opressor proteins to then uh

685
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,440
derpress um BCL6. Unfortunately, these

686
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,520
molecules were not that active in

687
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,520
cellular assays and not in vivo. And

688
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,080
people have also, for example, made

689
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:27,320
degraders using this liant, again, you

690
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:30,159
only get a partial um uh activation of

691
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,200
Bcl6. So the idea here was instead of

692
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,440
just um knocking off the core, let's add

693
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
now an additional step where we make a

694
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,520
bvealent that will also recruit an

695
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,760
activator. And you might have guessed

696
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,000
the theme of of BRD4 which we we can't

697
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,880
seem to get away from this protein uh

698
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,880
because BRD4 is generically activated

699
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,120
you know downstream of many an encogenic

700
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,440
uh signaling pathways. So we thought in

701
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,799
addition to removing uh the repressors

702
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
more efficiently by this blocking

703
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,960
interaction, if we can also bring the

704
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,240
transcriptional activation activity of

705
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,559
BR4, we might further induce the BCL6

706
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,200
dependent gene expression program to

707
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,360
activate the expression of proapoptoic

708
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,360
uh

709
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,120
genes. So the first um molecule that we

710
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,919
made kind of looks like a protac, but

711
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,240
it's not a protac. So it's JQ1 linked

712
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,919
via linker to this BCL6 um liant. And

713
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,840
then a second story I I'll tell you

714
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,679
about in a moment is we did the same

715
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,120
thing uh but instead of using uh BRD4 we

716
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,919
recruited uh CDK9 which is another very

717
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,919
potent uh transcriptional activator uh

718
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,919
protein.

719
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,720
So the reason that we chose uh BR4 not

720
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,399
only is because of the the well-known

721
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,399
pharmacology and our experience in

722
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,559
developing biovalence but also in

723
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,600
lymphoma it's a very powerful

724
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,360
co-activator of Mick uh and Mick is a

725
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,399
driving anka gene uh in

726
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,399
lymphoma. So here's what the the

727
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,320
workflow of this project looks like. We

728
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,520
build a library of these molecules where

729
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
we do many of the things that you do

730
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,000
with the protag molecule. we explore the

731
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,399
targeting lian uh the linker and then

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,120
Saigore Sankar a really talented student

733
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,279
in Jerry's lab uh developed a whole

734
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,120
series of assays that would allow us to

735
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,600
guide the the medicinal chemistry. So

736
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,399
the first assay is a gene activation

737
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:26,399
assay where we ask how well can these

738
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,399
molecules derpress BCL6 gene expression.

739
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,399
We then measure the ability to form

740
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,360
turnary complex formation. How how good

741
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,159
of a glue is it? And then we measure

742
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,880
Bcl6 dependent cell killing in a

743
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,559
proliferation assay. Whenever we do

744
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,039
this, we make two negative controls

745
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,039
where we either disable binding to BRD4

746
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,240
through making an anantimer on this side

747
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,720
or we modulate the ability to bind BCL6

748
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,600
through a very subtle mutation or

749
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,960
modification on on this side. So the

750
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,120
first molecule that we started

751
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
characterizing we called TIP 1 for

752
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,159
transcription chemical induced proximity

753
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,399
one and we got a very nice induction of

754
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,640
gene expression and it shows this

755
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,440
canonical hook behavior uh diagnostic of

756
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,159
um biomolecular molecules like this

757
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,480
where a critical concentration is used

758
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,240
to induce turnary complex formation. But

759
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,159
as you jack up the concentration too

760
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,080
high, then eventually you break up that

761
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,799
turnary complex and the gene expression

762
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,159
is induced not as

763
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,640
strongly. So we were very heartened to

764
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,360
see that these compounds were incredibly

765
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,520
efficient killers of lymphoma cells that

766
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,080
had high BCL6 expression. So here this

767
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,360
TIP 1 inhibiting cell proliferation at

768
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,360
about 1.3 nanomar. In contrast, the two

769
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,760
negative control molecules that either

770
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,559
inhibit because of BRD4 inhibition or

771
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,080
because of BCL6 inhibition are over a

772
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,440
hundfold uh less potent. We saw a very

773
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,600
good correlation in cytotoxicity between

774
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,880
cells that were high and dependent on

775
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,640
BCL6 uh and and well where there was

776
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,519
good killing by the T-IP uh molecule. We

777
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,000
then were able to take TIP 1 into invivo

778
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,399
studies in collaboration um first with

779
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,600
Mike Cameron at scripts uh and we could

780
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,519
show that the primary um uh organ type

781
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,240
where you saw dramatic effects on gene

782
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,200
expression were in in the spleen where B

783
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,720
cell reside but in in tissue types that

784
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,600
don't depend on BCL6 you see very modest

785
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,519
effects on uh on gene expression. Then

786
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,440
we looked at efficacy and here we

787
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,360
collaborated with Michael Green at MD

788
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,840
Anderson. So he is able to get uh

789
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,679
lymphas uh from uh folks that have

790
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,279
failed many lines of therapy. So

791
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,960
typically if you have lymphoma you get

792
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,760
chemotherapy and then you get salvage

793
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,039
therapy with uh other targeted agents

794
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,279
like BTK or with um archop or with bicep

795
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,440
specific antibodies. So even when we got

796
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,159
patients that had failed three to five

797
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,960
lines of therapy, uh their tumors when

798
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,360
implanted in mice responded very nicely

799
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,600
to these T-IP molecules. But this was

800
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,840
not any kind of sort of non- selective

801
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,159
activity because if we got lymphas that

802
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,320
were BCL6 negative, they didn't care

803
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,399
about the T-IP at all. They they grew uh

804
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,679
they grew very nicely. So this is really

805
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,760
a a mechanism that depends on the tumors

806
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,440
being driven by um

807
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,159
BCL6. then cited this really uh

808
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,799
insightful experiment to prove that

809
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,519
turnary complex formation is required

810
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:33,440
for cell death. And so what he did was

811
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,519
he titrated in the one-sided molecule in

812
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,880
the presence of the biovalent. So if you

813
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,799
first put in the biovalent compounds,

814
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
you kill cells very effectively. But

815
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,440
then if you titrate in one half of the

816
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,039
molecule, you actually rescue the

817
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,880
cytotoxicity. So even though there's

818
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,039
more drug there because you're breaking

819
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
up the turnary complex you rescue the

820
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,080
cytotoxicity and then once you get high

821
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,600
enough then the curves start coming down

822
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,919
again and you can do that both by

823
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,159
increasing the concentration of the BCL6

824
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,840
inhibitor you can also do it with a BRD4

825
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,840
inhibitor although that's harder because

826
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,440
the BRD4 inhibitor is cytotoxic um by

827
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,359
itself. So what happens at the chromatin

828
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,280
level? So what's happening at the

829
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,440
chromatin level is the T-IP is

830
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:19,119
relocizing BD4 from where it normally

831
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,440
exists at superenhancers to uh BCL6

832
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,079
binding sites. So fundamentally the

833
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,320
molecule moves BRD4 from where it's

834
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,280
normally bound and accumulates where

835
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,159
Bcl6 is bound and then those Bcl6

836
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,679
repressed genes are then turned on uh by

837
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,320
the molecule. And so here you're looking

838
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,839
at phosphorilation of RNA Paul 2. So

839
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,320
this is the enzyme that makes mRNA. So

840
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,720
as you look at increasing time you get

841
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,919
increased uh phosphorilation of serene 2

842
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,399
and turn on of RNA plyase 2. And the the

843
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,679
effect is so powerful because when

844
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,119
you're modulating this transcription

845
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,879
factor you're not just getting the

846
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
effect on one gene, you're getting the

847
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,640
effect on the entire Bcl6 gene

848
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,720
expression program. Right? So

849
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,720
transcription factors are so powerful to

850
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,000
get on your side because they regulate

851
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,599
many proteins

852
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,240
simultaneously. So one of the proteins

853
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,320
that it regulates is Mick. So actually

854
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,640
this compound is one of the most potent

855
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,320
indirect MC inhibitors uh that we've

856
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,119
ever seen. You're actually depleting

857
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,760
Mick at about one nanomolar of this T-IP

858
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,160
molecule. And then once you downregulate

859
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,440
Mick, all the Mick uh target genes are

860
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,079
also uh deregulated. This effect is

861
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,640
actually much more powerful than a

862
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,760
degrader. So we compared the effect of

863
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,359
degraders of either BRD4 or BCL6. The

864
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,280
T-IP is considerably uh uh more potent

865
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,000
even though it doesn't degrade the same

866
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,200
way that the other uh compounds do. So

867
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,280
that was you know recruitment of of

868
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,640
BRD4. We wanted to know is this a unique

869
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,119
feature to BRD4. So inspired in part

870
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,400
from our prior work on CDK9 as well as

871
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,680
Amitz's work recruiting uh kynases we

872
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:08,640
thought maybe we could try recruiting um

873
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,560
T-IPS with a CDK uh binder. So Basok

874
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,720
took this on uh in the lab and so here

875
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,800
the idea was can we bring CDK9 activity

876
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,280
to the sites of BCL6 to induce

877
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,720
phosphorilation of RNA Paul 2. And

878
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,359
again, we were partly inspired to do

879
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,240
this because there's a beautiful

880
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:28,800
pharmacopia of uh CDK9 inhibitors made

881
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,119
by uh many of the people uh uh some of

882
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,440
which are in this room. So these

883
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,720
compounds have varying affinity uh for

884
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,520
CDK9, but all of them bind in the ATP uh

885
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,920
binding site of uh

886
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,119
CDK9. And so again, the idea is making a

887
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,240
molecular glue to CDK9, pulling it to

888
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,520
chromatin via BCL6, and then hopefully

889
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,599
releasing CDK9 to phosphorolate RNA

890
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,160
polymerase 2. And so the initial

891
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:59,440
molecule that Basel made was uh shown

892
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,320
here, CDK TIP. Again, we make a negative

893
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,160
control on the BCL6 side or we methylate

894
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,040
the hinge binder of that site. only the

895
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,880
parental molecule again induces nice

896
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,280
hookshaped behavior in the gene

897
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,560
expression of GFP you get a nice

898
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,680
molecular uh gluing

899
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,440
interaction and then here's what was

900
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,119
really uh interesting when we look at

901
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
the anti-prololiferative uh

902
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,560
pharmarmacology so there's a bunch of

903
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,520
curves here let me just uh walk through

904
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,880
them so here is the t- molecule inhibits

905
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,960
cell proliferation at 9 n n n n n n n n

906
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,640
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

907
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,440
n n n n n n n n n n n nanomolar. Here's

908
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,960
the the parental liant the SNSO32

909
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,160
originally made by chemist at Bristol

910
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,119
Meyer Squib uh inhibiting here in the

911
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,520
high nanomolar range. Here's a degrader

912
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,000
of CDK9 that we published previously,

913
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,960
thal sns2. And then here's a very nice

914
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,839
compound made by Novartis NVP2 version

915
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,000
2.0 that has a very comparable potency

916
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,200
to the T-IP. So you can say, okay, well

917
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,160
that's not so impressive. You know, your

918
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,839
T-IP is just killing cells at the same

919
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,320
nominal concentration. Of course, this

920
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,599
compound is a normal low molecular

921
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,520
weight compound intracellular

922
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,160
concentration probably a thousandfold

923
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,800
higher than the T-I but at you know

924
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,880
similar concentrations here nominally

925
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,400
killing cells but the real surprise

926
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,960
comes when you don't look at cancer

927
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
cells but where you look at normal cells

928
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:24,240
so here the selectivity is completely

929
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:28,240
inverted so here the CDK9 inhibitor is

930
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,640
quite toxic to the normal tonsular cells

931
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,160
because they highly depend on CDK

932
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,680
activity. In contrast, the degrader uh

933
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,800
the the T-IP is only active at two

934
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,320
microar. Okay, so this is fundamentally

935
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,400
the difference between an occupancy

936
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,280
based inhibitor and in an event- driven

937
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,800
inhibitor. So this compound is working

938
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,960
because of transcriptional shutdown of

939
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,320
CDK9. This compound is working because

940
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,760
of BCL6 dependent recruitment of CDK9.

941
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,760
So you've completely changed the

942
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
therapeutic window by making this

943
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,240
bvealent compound. So to extend on that

944
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,320
finding, we collaborated with the the

945
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,359
prism group here at the broad institute

946
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:11,040
and we're able to show that this uh CDK

947
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:14,000
tip was extremely selective for lymphoma

948
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,520
cells that have high levels of BCL6. Uh

949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,240
you know in contrast, I didn't show it

950
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,160
here, but the CDK9 inhibitor will target

951
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,800
you know many cells that are addicted to

952
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,640
continual uh

953
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,560
transcription. So then Basa was inspired

954
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,640
to make further compounds or that

955
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,720
initial CDKTIP didn't have good PK

956
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,760
properties and so he took a play out of

957
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,320
the protag book of making uh rigidified

958
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,880
uh linkers and was able to make a second

959
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:43,040
compound uh that was even more potent

960
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:46,240
CDK TIP 2 activated about CDK at about

961
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,720
um 900 picolar with this spyro uh

962
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,200
linker. uh this compound had much more

963
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,680
reasonable uh pharmacology a halflife of

964
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,000
about three

965
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,400
hours and then we looked at the efficacy

966
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,079
of this molecule here not in cancer

967
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,599
models we actually looked at a germanal

968
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,920
center uh bell reaction so what bcl6 um

969
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,480
normally does is it gets upregulated

970
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,359
when cells are undergoing VDJ

971
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,839
recombination to make new uh antibodies

972
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:18,079
and so the ontarget pharmacology of

973
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,680
inhibiting uh BCL6 is to block germinal

974
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,000
center formation. That's exactly what we

975
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,000
see. So as we titrate in uh the

976
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,320
compound, we get a dose dependent

977
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,440
formation uh inhibition of germinal

978
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,680
center formation. In contrast, there's

979
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,079
almost no effect on naive cells or on

980
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,920
memory B cells. So we anticipate this is

981
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,040
going to be a much more targeted

982
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,599
approach for activated uh B cell

983
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,680
therapy. So as if you deplete B cells

984
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,440
you know with a antibbody then you're

985
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,839
going to kill you know both germinal B

986
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,400
centers as well as naive B cells and

987
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,920
memory B cells but Bcl6 is only

988
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,160
important when you're changing the gears

989
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,040
on gene expression uh and that's where

990
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,560
this T- molecule uh selectively uh

991
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,599
works. So again the model of what we see

992
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,800
happening here is we see CDK9 being

993
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,640
recruited away from superenhancers

994
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,800
towards the sites of BCL6. Uh that then

995
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,119
activates gene expression. You can see a

996
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,880
massive increase by chipsseek of

997
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,839
phosphorolated serene 2 um and then

998
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,160
release of CDK9 and phosphorilation of

999
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,400
RNA Paul 2.

1000
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,040
To corroborate this finding by an

1001
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,000
independent uh method, we instead

1002
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,920
recruited CDK9 not with the ATP

1003
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,880
competitive inhibitor. We instead made a

1004
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,200
tagged version of CDK9 and we could

1005
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,160
actually achieve uh the same thing. So

1006
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,119
if we link the BTB domain of BCL6 via

1007
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,440
the tag, we can also get a inducer of

1008
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,200
BCL6 dependent expression. again that

1009
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,880
corroborates that we're really

1010
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,319
recruiting the kynise activity of uh of

1011
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,800
CDK9. So I think this is going to be

1012
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,760
generally a a very powerful approach to

1013
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,560
link encoenic uh transcription factors

1014
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,319
to a uh a death regulator. And of course

1015
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,720
if the death regulator is a

1016
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,720
transcription factor you get the entire

1017
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,520
expression program of that death

1018
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,839
regulator uh and that induces many

1019
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,400
changes uh to the gene expression uh

1020
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,720
program. So beyond trying to kill uh

1021
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,440
cancer cells you can imagine uh

1022
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,200
modulating many other effects in uh gene

1023
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,240
expression. So for example, you could

1024
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,200
use a T-IP to try to turn on a uh a

1025
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,440
therapeutic uh gene by inducing a new

1026
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,119
interaction with a factor that drives uh

1027
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,240
that gene or you could induce for

1028
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,440
example other cell fates uh like

1029
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,800
differentiation if you affect the

1030
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,960
appropriate um uh

1031
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,960
factor. So I really think these um

1032
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,160
proximity based therapeutics due to

1033
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,000
their novel you know gain of function

1034
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,640
pharmarmacology can really uh reprogram

1035
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,800
cellular function in unanticipated ways

1036
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,680
and we have to be creative enough to

1037
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,359
figure out what pairings of targets will

1038
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,040
give you that that effect and so I think

1039
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,280
there's going to be an emerging field of

1040
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,079
of what I'm calling um functional

1041
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,160
genomics for glues. uh you can't just

1042
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,160
you know necessarily predict it based on

1043
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,560
the known function of the driver and the

1044
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,480
apotic protein. You may need to develop

1045
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,400
a functional genomic screen to ask

1046
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,760
what's the the new pharmacology that

1047
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,520
you're going to see through that

1048
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,440
unnatural um uh

1049
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,119
interaction. So let me uh stop and and

1050
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,440
thank some really incredible people that

1051
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,720
did uh all of this work. So the uh

1052
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,640
chemistry efforts in my lab are led by

1053
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,480
Tinguang and then all the degrader and

1054
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,560
proteomics work we've done uh in a

1055
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,119
long-standing uh collaboration with Eric

1056
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,359
Fischer's lab and Katherine Donovan. We

1057
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,920
then had a great collaboration with uh

1058
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,880
Brenda Schulman and Yakob that helped us

1059
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,640
figure out the whole white pel uh story.

1060
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,200
Ben Eert's lab and Zuzanna and Micholi.

1061
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,079
Um we've had tremendous collaboration

1062
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,400
with Michael um um green doing the

1063
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,480
pharmarmacology on lymphoma. Uh the

1064
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,119
whole tip uh concept we developed

1065
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,119
jointly with Jerry Crabtree's lab really

1066
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,880
spearheaded by Sai Gorsanker Basil Roman

1067
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,800
who has his own lab now in Germany uh

1068
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,000
WZY and I didn't get to talk about the

1069
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,880
work of Meredith who've been able to

1070
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,720
also do things with

1071
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,840
P300 and I'll stop there and take any

1072
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,760
questions.

1073
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:30,160
[Applause]

1074
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,040
Okay, questions starting with the

1075
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,880
graduate students and postocs. Let's

1076
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,040
see. I will just stand here until one of

1077
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,040
you ask a question.

1078
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Oh,

1079
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,119
um, thank you so much for your talk. So,

1080
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,839
this might be like a little bit more

1081
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,839
basic question, but um in the second

1082
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,839
part where you were talking about the

1083
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,119
molecular glues that you developed, you

1084
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,560
said specifically they're not Protax. Um

1085
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,960
but it seemed like you know you saw the

1086
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,000
hook effect and the way that you kind of

1087
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,960
developed them was like through kind of

1088
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,319
Protac ways that you would develop

1089
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,599
Protax. So how do you know that they're

1090
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,200
molecular glues and not Protax?

1091
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,800
Yeah. So I think people get a little bit

1092
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,359
confused. So in my mind a a a a glue has

1093
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,880
a you know a biochemical definition in

1094
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,280
that you you know get heightened

1095
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,520
affinity in the in the turnary complex.

1096
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,520
So a a protac uh can be a molecular glue

1097
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,240
if there is cooperivity in the binding

1098
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,319
and and so actually some some protaxs uh

1099
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,800
don't show a hook effect because of that

1100
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,119
enhanced uh affinity.

1101
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,400
So I think uh the distinction is

1102
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,760
actually sort of more important for the

1103
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,760
chemists you know are the chemists

1104
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,359
creating the molecule by you know making

1105
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,599
a hetereroyal linking two things

1106
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,480
together or are they making things by

1107
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,040
elaborating sort of a single uh compound

1108
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,920
but the the definition of the glue is

1109
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,680
really in the in the bioysics of that of

1110
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,680
that interaction. Um so the T-IP

1111
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,680
molecules that I I talked about some of

1112
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,520
them actually have molecular glue

1113
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,240
properties in that they have higher

1114
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,240
affinity in the glued uh turnary

1115
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,240
complex.

1116
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,760
Thank you very much for your nice talk.

1117
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm not experienc so I got interesting

1118
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,400
questions from the talk. I heard this is

1119
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,400
very powerful useful and interesting

1120
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,359
interest techniques. But my general

1121
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,000
question is from the disadvantage or

1122
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,240
challenges what do you what do we see I

1123
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,720
mean in the future for the glue based

1124
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,480
therapeutics.

1125
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,599
Yeah. No sorry I I think there's there's

1126
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,240
a huge interest right now in um uh in

1127
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,480
glues and you know chemists are are

1128
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,880
getting better at how to design them

1129
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,440
rationally you know how to find them by

1130
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,720
um uh by screening. So I think some of

1131
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,200
the things that would be really useful

1132
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,800
you know to work on right now is you

1133
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,800
know what I call uh direct to glue uh

1134
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,200
discovery because you know many many

1135
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,800
glues are actually really wimpy binders.

1136
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,480
So if you start from the binder first

1137
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,520
approach then you're going to miss all

1138
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,400
the glues that are wimpy binders but but

1139
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,400
good glues. So you need strategies to go

1140
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,640
you know directly to glues but you know

1141
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,119
chemists you know need to have some idea

1142
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,119
of what to make. So you know what's the

1143
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,839
chemical space for you know for a good

1144
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,000
glue. So obviously one approach is you

1145
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,680
know working off of glues like you know

1146
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,319
the theomide scaffold and there's been

1147
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,480
huge amounts of effort making glutamid

1148
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,599
uh derivatives and that that I think is

1149
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,800
exciting but I think we need uh ways of

1150
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,800
going uh directly to glues from uh low

1151
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,319
affinity binders. Uh and then I think

1152
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,839
the other you know major challenge is uh

1153
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,000
you know choosing you know what what

1154
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,200
what to glue together. You know we're

1155
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,760
still very much uh affected you know by

1156
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,160
the the human genome sequencing and the

1157
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,319
dependency map and looking for cancer

1158
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:07,200
dependencies and that's all uh well and

1159
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:09,680
good. But when you reprogram cells um

1160
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,720
what you're getting is is not just the

1161
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,920
the modulation of that single uh protein

1162
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,240
function. you're getting something

1163
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,599
completely denovo uh you know I don't

1164
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,280
know if you want to call it systems

1165
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,960
pharmarmacology or or what you want to

1166
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,880
call it but uh we need ways of um

1167
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,240
predicting what's going to happen and so

1168
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,200
some of the nice work I've seen coming

1169
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,760
out of Miko Taipal's lab so you know

1170
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,839
they're trying to do you know artificial

1171
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,599
gluing of two proteins together and then

1172
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,000
asking you know what what's the cellular

1173
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,680
effect of that so you know chemists need

1174
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,800
that information to know you know what

1175
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,800
what factors to bring together.

1176
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,559
Lovely talk. I'll probably squeeze in

1177
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,520
two small questions. The first one is in

1178
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,079
the case of your decaf

1179
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:00,319
16. Does the coalent attachment does

1180
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,240
anything to the endogenous targets? Does

1181
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,680
it degrade? And the second one is more

1182
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,920
of a philosophical question. Normally

1183
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,040
when you think about optimizing a small

1184
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,359
molecule, you look for potency, binding

1185
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,880
affinity. In terms of degradability, do

1186
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,800
you need a tight binder? Because you

1187
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,280
need the thing to go out. If you have a

1188
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,599
a pomola binder, your off rate is pretty

1189
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,000
low. You want the ubiconated molecule to

1190
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,599
go out and re-engage. So, could you

1191
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,319
comment on these two, please? Yeah. So,

1192
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,960
yeah. So, for first question, yeah, no,

1193
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,040
it's it's, you know, um coalent

1194
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,760
modification of the indogenous protein.

1195
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,800
There's nothing um uh tagged in there.

1196
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,000
Uh and then, you know, the protein

1197
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,440
that's getting tagged is the liase. So

1198
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,119
once tagged that ligase then is a uh

1199
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,040
catalyst for degradation of everything

1200
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,440
that that modified ligase binds to. So

1201
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,240
there's still turnover uh in in that you

1202
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,160
know in that scenario. So yeah there's

1203
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,559
been some nice work from uh Fur

1204
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,960
Ferguson's lab where they've sort of

1205
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,960
characterized the the regimes that

1206
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,720
different degraders operate in. Right?

1207
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,359
So there's what we sort of call the kiss

1208
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,280
of death compounds where it's a very

1209
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,760
wimpy interaction but it's a perfect

1210
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,359
geometry setup for ubiquitation and so

1211
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,359
transient interaction is enough to get

1212
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,880
ubiquitation and degradation and then

1213
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,640
there's some where um it's a slow

1214
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,119
ubiquitation and you need a stable

1215
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,800
turnary complex and so in that case you

1216
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,640
need you know higher affinity binding

1217
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,800
you need more gluing because the

1218
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,000
ubiquitation is sluggish sometimes it's

1219
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,559
because of the biohysics of that

1220
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,559
interaction sometimes it's because Some

1221
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,040
substrates for example have associated

1222
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,720
deubiquitating enzyme that's constantly

1223
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,040
taking off the ubiquitin and that can be

1224
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,520
very hard to uh you know to counteract.

1225
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,760
So I think you know like any good

1226
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,960
medicinal chemistry campaign uh you know

1227
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,119
the the closer you can be on the SR with

1228
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,960
the functionally relevant assay you know

1229
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,240
the better and so you know a lot of

1230
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,920
companies that are efficient making

1231
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,160
degraders you know they're directly

1232
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,720
measuring that efficiency of of

1233
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,599
degradation of course you know binding

1234
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,359
might be necessary but sometimes uh you

1235
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,040
know the binding is is really weak and

1236
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,040
it's still a very very good uh you know

1237
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,200
degrader I think one challenge we have

1238
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,839
in the field is that we're not so good

1239
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,839
at picking which targets that we're

1240
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,599
going to see a big benefit from from

1241
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,960
degradation. So we know we can degrade

1242
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,680
it but you know where are we going to

1243
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,160
get a a big shot in the arm because of

1244
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,160
uh you know

1245
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,599
degradation beautiful talk could you

1246
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,480
speculate a little bit about monovalent

1247
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,800
tips and which methods do you think we

1248
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,359
should think about in order to search

1249
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,200
for them whether any type of modeling of

1250
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:47,359
phenotypic screening or or Yeah. How

1251
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,800
difficult do you think we'll we'll have

1252
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,160
to try to to find those?

1253
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,680
Yeah. So I think you know we could

1254
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,640
certainly you know do this kind of fish

1255
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,240
hook approach with all the epigenetic

1256
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,079
modifiers right. So there's you know

1257
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,480
beautiful chemistry now done by the

1258
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,960
epigenetics field for all the readers

1259
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,400
writers and erasers of chromatin. So you

1260
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,839
could you know you could elaborate some

1261
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,240
of those uh scaffolds. Personally I'm

1262
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:15,119
I'm satisfied to be in hetererovalent

1263
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,800
land initially to you know figure out

1264
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,480
the matching and pairings you know that

1265
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,800
that work uh and then you know if if you

1266
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,640
know the hetererovalent is too clunky to

1267
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,720
be uh developed you know then then try

1268
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,480
to get you know a smaller interaction.

1269
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,079
Of course you know the the problem with

1270
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,680
hetererovalence is you know it's usually

1271
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,760
like linking the two crocodiles you know

1272
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,119
by the mouth. Uh, and that's maybe not

1273
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,319
what you want to do, right? You might

1274
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,319
want to have the two crocodiles come

1275
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,680
together by their bellies. Uh, and that

1276
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,680
and that could be better, you know, with

1277
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,400
a with a glue type compound, but we're

1278
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,839
still at a very early state of of

1279
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,760
finding uh, you know, gluing

1280
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,359
interactions. Of course, biology has

1281
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,599
been doing gluing act interactions, you

1282
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,319
know, forever. You know, phosphorilation

1283
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,079
is a covealent glue, right? It's a

1284
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,520
phosphate and then it induces a protein

1285
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,400
protein interaction. So, it's coalent

1286
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,079
and and it's a glue. And often you know

1287
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,760
the the amount of affinity that you need

1288
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,760
there is you know can be can be quite

1289
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,079
small. So I think that's a a very

1290
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,079
exciting area.

1291
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:17,119
Hey uh thanks for your talk. I had a

1292
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:19,359
question about maybe about the the issue

1293
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,599
that you said about targeting for the

1294
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,720
last part because you targeted you know

1295
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:28,640
the death

1296
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:30,160
uh sequences and I was just curious um

1297
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,280
as to whether you think there's an

1298
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,800
immune component to that. That seems

1299
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,880
like a clever target because you would

1300
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:43,119
get potentially then an immune component

1301
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,800
in the animals and so I wondered if

1302
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:49,680
you'd actually looked for that. Yeah.

1303
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,400
No. So, so, so definitely, you know, you

1304
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,440
you affect uh expression of markers that

1305
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,680
will affect the the the immune uh

1306
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,720
effects because BCL6 regulates all sorts

1307
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:03,040
of uh cell surface uh proteins. But you

1308
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,839
can imagine you know other systems where

1309
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,720
you know you'd want to increase MHC you

1310
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,480
know presentation. Uh so no definitely I

1311
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,559
think that's a viable target. There's a

1312
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,359
beautiful talk you know and we've also

1313
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,720
been working on on on p-53 you can try.

1314
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,480
So there's the field of corrector

1315
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,559
molecules and corrector molecules have

1316
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,720
typically just you know stabilized an

1317
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:25,359
unstable protein but you can also

1318
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,240
correct by gluing in another you know

1319
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,960
scaffolding uh function. So there's, you

1320
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,520
know, not now good examples of glues for

1321
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,079
uh p-53 to to rescue, you know, weakened

1322
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:40,119
alals of that. So I think that that's a

1323
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,119
potential uh, you know, as well.

1324
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,920
All right. Good. Um so you talked about

1325
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,559
this approach where you search in a very

1326
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,480
focused uh place in chemical space by

1327
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,680
creating a binder and then decorating it

1328
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,559
to find degraders but I'm curious like

1329
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,480
what your intuitions are on neopppis

1330
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,400
that are not just finding ubiquitin

1331
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,000
liases are we going to see a lot of

1332
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,440
fruitful stuff there no absolutely so

1333
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,839
yeah I mean there's a beautiful paper

1334
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,119
from from Katherine and Eric you know

1335
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:19,359
doing uh IPMS you know with glut blue

1336
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,720
tyramid uh libraries and and certainly

1337
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,880
you find some of the things that are

1338
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,280
degraded but you also find a lot of

1339
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,599
other uh weak interactions. I didn't

1340
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,119
show the data but we've done IPMS with

1341
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:33,200
all of our uh T-IPS and amazingly we

1342
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,440
could have done target ID if we had not

1343
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,200
known the the two lians by that IPMS

1344
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,400
data. So you can really pull down the

1345
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,720
relevant um uh targets but you also find

1346
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,559
uh you know some other things. So you

1347
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,760
know one approach may be yeah you know

1348
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:50,319
you find uh weak glues by IPMS and then

1349
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,079
you elaborate weak glues into you know

1350
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:55,280
functional aectors of of those targets.

1351
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,960
So I think that that is a possible uh

1352
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:01,359
work plan for um uh you know for that um

1353
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,200
and then I think there will be you know

1354
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,520
like there are for active site binders I

1355
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,480
do think there will be privileged uh

1356
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,240
scaffolds for canonical interaction. So,

1357
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,880
you know, for a helix groove

1358
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,480
interaction, uh, there may be a scaffold

1359
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,680
that helps, you know, mimic that and

1360
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,680
serves as a as a molecular

1361
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:25,839
glue. Great talk. Thank you, uh, for the

1362
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,200
nice overview on the T-zip. So, the I'm

1363
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,960
still got something like swirling in my

1364
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,040
head. So, you have a CDK9 inhibitor,

1365
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,760
right? The BMS molecule, and now it's

1366
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,000
fused to BCL6. So, what do you think's

1367
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,000
going on molecularly in there? because

1368
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,680
you have a CDK9 inhibitor and then

1369
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,319
you're relying on it to be a

1370
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,599
transcriptional

1371
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:45,040
elongation kynise, right? But you've

1372
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,280
blocked up the active site with your

1373
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,119
drug. So what do you think's actually

1374
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,280
going on physically? Yeah, sorry I I I

1375
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,599
went through that too quickly. Um so we

1376
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,200
we think it's a catch and release uh

1377
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,400
mechanism and we sort of have two lines

1378
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,680
of evidence to to corroborate that. When

1379
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,520
we tried to do a T-IP with NVP2, which

1380
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,920
is much higher affinity, it doesn't work

1381
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,119
at all. it does it doesn't release uh

1382
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,920
and then we also recruited CDK9 uh you

1383
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,960
know via this FKBP tag uh you know and

1384
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,520
that also worked and then when we do

1385
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:20,240
that and we throw in the kynis inhibitor

1386
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,160
then it then it stops working so it's a

1387
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,400
you know recruitment dependent you know

1388
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,880
kindness activity recruitment dependent

1389
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,520
process and then we see you know

1390
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,960
upregulation of uh RNA Paul 2

1391
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,440
phosphorilation so we we see the

1392
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,760
canonical mark so we think it's really a

1393
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,760
you So it's like uh you know pulling a

1394
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,839
dog by the muzzle, the muzzle comes off

1395
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:43,040
and then the dog you know starts biting

1396
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,400
things. So yeah. So your drug is

1397
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,599
collocicalize these things. Do you think

1398
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,920
that there's any sort of like a

1399
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,079
condensate that keeps it doesn't just

1400
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,000
diffuse away quickly? Yeah. So so so I I

1401
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,880
do think there's a local environment

1402
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,359
effect. So I I you know I don't know how

1403
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,240
how general that is. You know Amit's

1404
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,400
nice work with the uh thick approach uh

1405
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,640
I think is beginning to address that. So

1406
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,280
part of it is localization but you know

1407
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,920
kinases do have uh you know substrate

1408
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,920
specificity right so you need a a good

1409
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,920
you know consensus phosphorilation site

1410
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,359
and yeah you need it not to diffuse away

1411
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,240
too quickly and then of course it also

1412
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,240
depends on how um efficient that that

1413
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,920
kinace is at at phosphorilation and then

1414
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,240
of course the geometry for for setting

1415
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,559
up that phosphorilation reaction but I

1416
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,559
do think there will be a lot of uh

1417
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,240
kynases where you know you're

1418
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,680
essentially you know getting a gain of

1419
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,359
function through induced

1420
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,359
phosphorilation. Awesome. Thanks.

1421
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,880
It's like know the condensate formation

1422
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:45,599
like you know catch and release. So the

1423
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,000
release requires that well you know the

1424
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,720
Kanye should not move away too far from

1425
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,920
the side right so there is a

1426
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,760
diffusibility question and so do you

1427
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,440
think it's only in the condensate

1428
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,520
context that's where these uh we can use

1429
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,920
an inhibitor of a kind so if I want to

1430
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,079
do it in a cytool where or in a highly

1431
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,799
dynamic system where proteins can move

1432
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,480
far apart really quickly where can can

1433
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,079
we really use an inhibitor in those

1434
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,880
context?

1435
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah, I mean we we we have one one data

1436
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,839
point here. So I I I wouldn't venture a

1437
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,280
speculation, but I I I'm sure there'll

1438
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:21,599
be situations like you describe where

1439
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,960
it'll it could diffuse away uh you know

1440
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
too quickly.

1441
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:36,960
Um thanks. So So the death spiral for

1442
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,440
cancer therapeutics is resistance is

1443
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,960
chemical resistance. So are glues going

1444
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,960
to be better or worse? Yeah, great great

1445
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,000
question. So we've looked at this a

1446
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,559
little bit. So the Achilles heel so far

1447
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,160
we've seen, you know, both for some

1448
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:56,319
Protax and for uh T-IPS is is one, you

1449
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,079
know, they're hetererovalent. So you

1450
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,240
know, e-lux pumps and other things can,

1451
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,400
you know, elux the compound. They're

1452
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,480
also, you know, highly dependent in the

1453
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,359
case of the T-IPS, you know, on BCL6

1454
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,319
expression. So if the tumors can evolve

1455
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:13,400
to to low Bcl6 expression uh then they

1456
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:16,880
become resistant. However,

1457
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:20,079
um these compounds kill incredibly uh

1458
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,799
you know rapidly and they're active

1459
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,359
killers that depend on the anka gene and

1460
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,720
they don't care about bypass signaling

1461
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,280
because they're basically taking the

1462
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,880
cancer driver and inducing death. So you

1463
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,040
know one common thing for kindness

1464
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,720
inhibitors like with EGFR they can

1465
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,880
upregulate MET and then they don't care

1466
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,359
about EGFR anymore because they have CMT

1467
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,079
but in this case it's fine if CET comes

1468
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:44,079
on because the EGFR signaling is going

1469
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,559
to drive the the cell death sort of an

1470
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,480
active killing uh mechanism. So I think

1471
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,720
the the the resistance mechanism are

1472
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,720
likely to be orthogonal to occupancy

1473
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,559
based inhibitors which suggest you know

1474
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,480
maybe they can be used um you know

1475
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,079
together. But the big advantage of these

1476
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,599
T-IPS is because they're

1477
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:03,520
contextual, they require A and B to be

1478
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,400
there. You immediately have more of an

1479
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,040
andgate in their in their activity. So

1480
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,799
as I showed for the CDK9 TIP, you know,

1481
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,760
we get, you know, much more selective

1482
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,760
killing of um, you know, BCL6 dependent

1483
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:20,880
lymphas than we would with a, you know,

1484
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:24,640
CDK9 or other, you know, inhibitor.

1485
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:27,440
Any any other questions?

1486
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,680
Okay, this one from a traininee. So the

1487
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,680
last

1488
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,359
one it's a small question for first

1489
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:43,280
part. So uh you observe in a deg

1490
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:46,720
development you observe the um the

1491
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,760
suffix region ended up surfic acid. Does

1492
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,400
it happen uh every time for kind of

1493
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,720
suffix regent or is that the general

1494
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,520
metabolic pathway for that kind of

1495
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,079
region? Yeah. So, so that you know

1496
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,920
highly reactive sulfanyl fluoride you

1497
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,040
know gets metabolized by intracellular

1498
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:08,079
glutathione. So it does happen pretty uh

1499
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,760
pretty generically but I'm not proposing

1500
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,839
that you know sulfanyl fluorides are

1501
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,599
going to be you know good uh prod drugs

1502
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,720
for for drugs because you know they're

1503
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,240
too reactive and they're going to

1504
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,400
probably be taken out you know through

1505
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,000
through liver metabolism but there's

1506
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,599
other ways you know we can get a a

1507
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,839
negatively charged group you know and

1508
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,760
probably a better prod drug would be a

1509
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:28,079
you know hydraytic reaction from a

1510
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,200
sulfonate you know type esester uh and

1511
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,680
so you can explore that kind of

1512
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,680
chemistry too.

1513
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:43,940
Okay, thanks a lot.

1514
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:43,940
[Applause]
