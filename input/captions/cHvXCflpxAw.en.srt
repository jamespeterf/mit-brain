1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,520
next next in the agenda is for me to

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,240
tell you a little bit more on where we

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,759
are at MTL after the very strong

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,839
foundation of the last 40 years what are

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,039
the key topical areas that our

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,359
researchers and our community are

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:24,480
working on and what are the next few

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,720
revolutions coming to electronics

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,279
through Microsystems and micro

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,399
technology and that's what we going to

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:37,960
be talking about for for the next half

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:41,160
an hour or so how MTL at 40 is uniquely

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,520
position to really tackle the challenges

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,440
of the

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,879
future so let's get started uh and let's

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,039
think a little bit about a semiconductor

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,199
technology and how it came about I I

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,600
think modern modern Electronics started

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:02,000
in 1947 with the invention of a

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,479
transistors and although it is a bit of

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,840
a stretch to argue that shle was an MTL

22
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:13,520
alarm but he he grew up in in the

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,759
community uh the amazing ecosystem that

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,000
MIT

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,560
forms but very shortly after the the

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
first transistor it was clear that there

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,640
was a problem transistor solate

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,360
devices they they they were something

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,680
that physicist understood but it was

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,680
very difficult for for engineers to

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,000
really take that to the next level and

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:44,439
that's where from my point of view the

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,240
the MTL Community kind of started to to

34
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,560
appear the identifi the need of taking

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,799
semiconductor devices from the domain of

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:59,320
physics into engineering and in 1960 the

37
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,880
MIT Community got together to put

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,119
together what what is called the

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,320
semiconductor Electronics education

40
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,000
committee that really set the

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,560
foundations

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,599
of semiconductor devices and

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Microsystems as a an engineering

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,680
field ER that was in 1960 to to put

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,720
things in context I I went back to ER

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,319
Mo's original paper where he described

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,120
the exponential growth of the number of

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,760
devices in a chip and and so on and I I

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,720
tried to identify okay how many

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,879
transistors did we have back in in

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,239
1960 in in the microsystem and if you

52
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,400
look at at the plot on the bottom left

53
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,159
that that's a a log base

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,519
two and in 1960 there were probably two

55
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,959
transistors on on a chip so it was

56
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,120
fairly it was very

57
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
revolutionary that in 1960 the MIT

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,480
Community was already saying hey this

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,599
this is going to transform the world we

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,720
need to bring this from physics to to

61
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,799
engineering and let's develop the

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,400
curriculum to to make that a possible a

63
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,080
few years later

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,840
1968 the the first clean room facility

65
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
at MIT was open what is called the

66
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,680
integrated microelectronics laboratory

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,840
or microlab which was located in

68
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,879
building building 13 that was the the

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,760
very first seed for what would become a

70
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,200
MTL in the

71
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,400
future few years later

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,959
1978 the the the introduction to VSA

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,840
systems class H was put together this

74
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,560
was one of the very first multiproject

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,439
chip design courses in the world and it

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,720
happened here by the people who in a few

77
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:54,640
years who then officially start a

78
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,280
MTL the what is called today the MTL

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,959
seminar series was actually started in

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,480
in

81
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,560
1979 with the original title of the MIT

82
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,239
vsi seminar series which changed to MTL

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,640
seminar in

84
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:16,120
2007 and finally in 1980 MIT announced

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,120
plans to to establish what would later

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,120
become MTL and the original name was the

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,560
LSI fabrication

88
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:30,080
facility and then time went by and

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,320
finally we reach 1984

90
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
and that was a really busy year in in

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,639
the

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,880
US Ronald Reagan became

93
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,720
president we had the the Olympic Games

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,320
in in in

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,320
La Ghostbuster was a

96
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
blockbuster Apple released the

97
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:59,120
Macintosh Boston Celtics won the

98
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,520
MBA and back in Spain I was getting

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,039
ready to come to the

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,840
US everything happening everything

101
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:10,320
happening in 1984 I I was ready I was

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,360
ready but the the the the most important

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,759
thing that happened in 1984 was that

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,400
actually MTL as an entity the

105
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
Microsystems technology

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,120
Laboratories was

107
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
founded and it was founded by Professor

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,840
Demitri

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Antonis who who many years later recall

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,960
that hey I I still remember vividly the

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,240
the afternoon that Professor Paul

112
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Penfield walk into my his office in

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,680
Building

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,360
13 and told Professor

115
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,440
antoniadi you better sit down we MIT

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,600
have decided that we must build a state

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,440
of the art microelectronics lab and you

118
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,319
will be leading that that project and

119
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,120
that was the beginning of MTL what we

120
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,120
are celebrating

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,360
today and the rest is history

122
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,120
and it's all about the amazing community

123
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,039
that has been formed around that initial

124
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,639
that initial seed and I have L lots of

125
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:17,520
additional details here MTL move from

126
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,560
Building 13 to to building 39 back in

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,639
1986 the the PTC the process technology

128
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,479
committee that that that that has

129
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,639
overseen all the fabrication happening

130
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,400
at at MIT since then was start in

131
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,000
1990 Professor Rafael RI was appointed

132
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,000
MTL

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,199
director in in that around that

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,120
time ER more things MTL reporting moved

135
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,919
to the School of Engineering 1995 the

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
center for integrated circuits and

137
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:53,319
systems one one of the most important

138
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,479
building blocks o of MTL was founded by

139
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,479
Professor Harry Lee in

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:04,319
1998 year 2001

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,199
the MIT clean room got upgraded from 4

142
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,440
in to state-of-the-art 6 in Wafers back

143
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,440
back

144
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,879
then 2002 we decided that we had to open

145
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,000
up the

146
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,840
community for for industry to also use

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,400
our our facilities and and we created

148
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,440
what is called the Microsystems

149
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,680
affiliate program that allowed companies

150
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,879
from all over the US to actually use our

151
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,599
facilities and work work side by side

152
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,080
with MTL

153
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,400
researchers Coral the the the software

154
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,160
that manages the the Fab was introduced

155
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,160
202

156
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,440
2003 2

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,240
2014 MIT Nano was

158
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,759
created thanks to to the leadership of

159
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,680
President R thanks to the vision that he

160
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,120
had in collaboration with Professor

161
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Vladimir bulovic and the MTL Community

162
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,120
the MIT

163
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,199
Community the decision was made to

164
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,479
upgrade our fabrication facility to what

165
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,479
I think is the world's best R&D cleaning

166
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,159
facility that was

167
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:26,599
2014 and in

168
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:29,759
2018 MIT Nano officially open and MTL be

169
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,599
became fabulous and I really hate that

170
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,680
that sentence I I don't know who came

171
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:40,279
out with the Moto MTL became fabulous I

172
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,320
hate that because it's not true I I

173
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,320
prefer I prefer to say that in in

174
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,720
2018 a my Nano opens and at that point

175
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,959
MTL was able to focus 100% of its energy

176
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,079
on how to change the the wall through

177
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:02,440
Microsystems I'm sure collaborating

178
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:06,600
closely with a MIT Nano to enable

179
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:10,040
stateoftheart fabrication at MIT but the

180
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,880
MTL Community was now free to have to

181
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,320
manage the clean room and we could focus

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,480
100% of our time on how to change the

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,480
the

184
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,320
wall and that brings us to the MTL of

185
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,079
today the natural home of Microsystems

186
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,760
research and education at at

187
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,399
MIT where we understand micros systems

188
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,600
in in very broad very broad terms from

189
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,079
materials to systems through Innovations

190
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,200
in microelectronics materials

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:56,320
etc ER the the this is the the the team

195
00:09:52,079 --> 00:10:01,000
of people that are fortunate to to be

196
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:05,120
able to lead this amazing community

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,720
today Professor Ronan Han a w expert on

198
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,680
circuit design and Professor Bill GIS a

199
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,640
a leading expert well expert amazing

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,320
person and really a extraordinary

201
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,120
researcher on pushing the limits of

202
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,839
material Material Science and ai ai

203
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,839
Hardware they are joining me in the

204
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,320
leadership team with Dr Charles who our

205
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,320
Consortium manager

206
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,519
so when I was putting together this

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,839
presentation I I I thought okay how can

208
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:43,760
we summarize 40 years o of research in

209
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,040
into a few minutes how do I convince our

210
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,360
community of the tremendous impact that

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,720
that MTL is having in many different

212
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,079
levels and and and the question the

213
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,200
problem was how how to down select how

214
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,399
how to identify out of the thousands of

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,920
impactful papers that have come out how

216
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,639
to identify the the the the top ones

217
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,560
very quickly I I I decided that it was

218
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,560
impossible but I I I I can I I can give

219
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,800
you

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,040
a a glimpse o of the breath o of work

221
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,000
happening at at MTL

222
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,079
today we we are very proud of addressing

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,079
the full stack of innovation in in

224
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,440
Microsystems there is a lot of work

225
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,760
going on in materials Discovery using

226
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,560
machine learning and automatic

227
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,399
experimentation to really innovate in

228
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,440
new microelectronics

229
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,959
materials there is also lots of effort

230
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,800
in in in many many different groups to

231
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,880
discover the next big electronic device

232
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:52,160
the next big sensor device the next big

233
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,200
photonic device but then we take these

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,240
new materials and devices and we put

235
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,200
them into circuits for a wide variety of

236
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,760
applications all the way from 5G and 6G

237
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,519
networks and Communications to extremely

238
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,920
secure adcs and ID taxs going all the

239
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,600
way through a super conducting

240
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,880
Electronics flexible electronics that is

241
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,040
trying to change the form factor of

242
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,360
Microsystems a temperat Microsystems

243
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:30,000
that are pushing the limits of where

244
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Microsystems can operate Etc and then we

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,160
take those chips made of a silicon as

246
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,600
well as other Advanced Materials and we

247
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,959
prototype a wide variety of systems in

248
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,160
lots of different applications the

249
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
energy

250
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,839
space

251
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,079
robotics

252
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,519
sustainability Health Care

253
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,639
Etc and we do that over and over again

254
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,680
and and I I was counting how many

255
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,760
different projects and Microsystems are

256
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,760
going on

257
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,160
at MTL today and it's more than 200

258
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,920
happening today right now in all these

259
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,160
topics and spending all all the way to

260
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:17,360
supply change and even policy policy

261
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,959
issues but how how do we

262
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,839
quantify um impact again I was

263
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,279
struggling with that question and I

264
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,120
thought okay maybe a way to quantify

265
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,199
impact is to to count how many best

266
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,000
papers Awards we we've had

267
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,199
and again that was very very difficult

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,600
but I I decid okay let's choose a a a a

269
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:41,199
few top journals for example the top

270
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,000
journals in in semiconductor devices are

271
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,639
electron device letters and the

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,880
transactions on electron devices so

273
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,600
let's count let's look at which are the

274
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,199
papers coming from the MTL community

275
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,120
that made it to the best paper of the

276
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,880
Year award in these top journals and and

277
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,240
I I I found

278
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,399
the these ones I I just have them here

279
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,519
to to highlight the breadth of our

280
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,600
community you'll find papers on Power

281
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,519
Electronics you'll find papers on white

282
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,279
banga RF amplifiers you'll find papers

283
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,079
on pushing the limits of simos

284
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,240
Technology through germanium

285
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,320
transistors increasing the performance

286
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,360
of silicon through the use of strain

287
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,560
silicon

288
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,040
germanium lowering the power consumption

289
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,800
in in transistors by dynamically

290
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,440
changing the threshold

291
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,279
voltage let's go to the top conferences

292
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,320
let's go to iedm and

293
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,440
vsi

294
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,399
issdc and and we again find more papers

295
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,519
on pushing the limits of compound

296
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,000
semiconductors pushing the limits of

297
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,680
two-dimensional materials and systems

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,680
pushing the limits of AI and and many

299
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,120
many more but I was completely wrong I

300
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,399
don't think this is the way to to

301
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,360
measure impact because although of

302
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,399
course we are very proud o o o o of

303
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,440
these and many other Awards

304
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:16,160
a when we try to to quantify the impact

305
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:19,120
that this has in the world is good but I

306
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,519
think is not the the the main point then

307
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,279
I thought okay we we have really nice

308
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:29,000
papers but we are more than papers we

309
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,120
are 70 different research groups really

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,399
pushing the limits o of Microsystems in

311
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,639
all different dimensions and they are

312
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,279
all the the best in the wall at what

313
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,680
they

314
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,920
do that's

315
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,040
impact and and sure we are very proud of

316
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,079
of our research groups and we think we

317
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,600
are making impact but I I I'm still

318
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,880
wrong this is not the right

319
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,399
metric the real way we are making impact

320
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,199
in the world today is through our

321
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,480
community is through our alarms it's

322
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,920
through everyone who has been touched by

323
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,399
the by the MTL e

324
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,600
ecosystem and it's an amazing banch I

325
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,319
mean it's just a truly remarkable

326
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,759
community and that's what we are TR

327
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:20,519
truly proud proud of and they are making

328
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,040
huge impact in all different dimensions

329
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,040
of of Microsystems and

330
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,560
technology so again when I think of of

331
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,519
what are the key enablers for for MTL

332
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,000
over the last four decades and what is

333
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,000
what is going to propel us into the

334
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:44,079
future it's the community upfront strong

335
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,079
Community uh and its values its full

336
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,600
commitment for for excellence in in all

337
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:54,199
different domains of of

338
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:58,040
knowledge we are a a a big lab and we

339
00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:01,759
thrive on interdisciplinary research and

340
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:05,199
we organize ourselves into research

341
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:09,079
communities such as CICS the center for

342
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,880
integrated circuits and systems or metc

343
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,919
focusing on medical Electronics the MIT

344
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,880
AI Hardware program pushing the limits

345
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:23,480
of AI and the hardware to to lower the

346
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,520
power consumption of AI data centers and

347
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,720
many many more centers and initiatives

348
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,720
like this

349
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,679
we are also extremely fortunate to to

350
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,799
have an incredible partnership with MIT

351
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:43,160
Nano MTL was started to provide micro

352
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,960
and nanofabrication

353
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,720
services to

354
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,960
MIT we transfer that responsibility to

355
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,799
MIT Nano but we are still fully engaged

356
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,559
in in that facility and we are very

357
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:04,600
proud of MIT n

358
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:04,600
and it's one of our huge

359
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,480
assets and all that gives us a very

360
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:14,520
strong startup ecosystem and I was

361
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,640
sharing this with some of you yesterday

362
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,919
and 5 seconds after I I I finished my my

363
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,840
talk yesterday someone approached me and

364
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,600
said hey sure it is true that all these

365
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,039
startups have come out

366
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,960
of MIT MTL but it's only a very small

367
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:38,200
list so we we spend the night looking at

368
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,559
the full list and we found that there

369
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,640
are more than 50 startups that have come

370
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:47,960
out of MTL over the last four

371
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,360
decades and we are very proud of every

372
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,080
single one of them and how they are all

373
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,080
changing the world in their own

374
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,240
way and the the the final key enabler

375
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,000
that I want to highlight is our very

376
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,679
strong partnership with with industry at

377
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
all different levels I mean we work with

378
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,760
hundreds of Industry Partners every

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,120
single day to really push the limits of

380
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,320
of

381
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,960
Microsystems thank you thank you to all

382
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,640
all our industry

383
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,440
[Applause]

384
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,919
partners and out of all of

385
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,520
those I I do want to to highlight those

386
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,600
who are part of the Microsystems

387
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:40,640
technology Laboratories industrial group

388
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:44,039
or or M these are companies many of them

389
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,720
that have been with MTL for the last 40

390
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,559
years really supporting MTL at all

391
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,640
different

392
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:56,280
levels R&D of course but also building

393
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,120
the ecosystem

394
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:03,400
together helping us with workfor

395
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,520
development and really working with us

396
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,720
to develop a a talent both in the

397
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,960
companies and at

398
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,120
MTL so I really appreciate the members

399
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,080
of of the micro sistance industrial

400
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,280
group these 16 companies that have

401
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,400
really helped us to to reach a a a

402
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,080
amazing amazing level here at MTL thank

403
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,080
you thank you

404
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,600
and O of course the the the key leasons

405
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,039
at all these companies who have been

406
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,559
able to provide really really important

407
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,880
feedback over the decades to build

408
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,120
today's

409
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,000
MTL so in in the last nine minutes let

410
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,559
let me talk about the future and the

411
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,559
opportunities

412
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,600
ahead we we are in a truly amazing time

413
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,320
for microelectronics and we just need to

414
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,480
read the newspapers every day here we

415
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,080
have one The Wall Street Journal a few

416
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,520
months ago chips are the new oil and

417
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,640
America is spending billions to

418
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
safeguard its

419
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,720
Supply another one Taiwan launches its

420
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,760
own cheap Fab incentives to rival us

421
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,799
Japan and the European

422
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:26,960
Union another one soft Bank NEC Sony

423
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:31,159
Toyota plus team up to to build rapidos

424
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Japan's bid for next chap

425
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,799
domination European union leaders strike

426
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,440
43 billion to Bo semiconductor

427
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,559
production in

428
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,039
Europe the key message here is that

429
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,679
microelectronics semiconductors devices

430
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,919
Microsystems engineers and scientists

431
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,960
that is all of you

432
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,679
MTL are really the rock stars of the

433
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,640
next 25 years we have an amazing

434
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,240
opportunity in front of us so next time

435
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,760
you you you you you look at yourself in

436
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,200
in in the mirror don't be surprised if

437
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,200
you see

438
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,320
this oh I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry my my

439
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,679
mistake that that's not you I'm

440
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,480
sorry because definitely you you are not

441
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,679
rock stars I'm

442
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,320
sorry you are actually the superheroes

443
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,720
of the 21st century that that that's

444
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,960
what the MTL Community is all about

445
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,480
because we need superheroes to to make

446
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,120
personalized Affordable Health Care in

447
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,799
the future and that will happen thanks

448
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,760
to the Microsystems that we are all

449
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,440
Building

450
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:50,600
Together We need superheroes to feed the

451
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,279
wall and we will be using Microsystems

452
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,919
to really increase the efficiency of

453
00:22:53,279 --> 00:23:00,840
agriculture in a sustainable

454
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,760
way we need superheroes to fight climate

455
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,799
change and the Microsystems we are all

456
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,720
building here at MTL are critical

457
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,720
components of green

458
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,520
energy and of course microelectronics

459
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,880
and what we are building together it's

460
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,760
everywhere in the AI Revolution and this

461
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:27,440
is a huge opportunity at the same time a

462
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:31,559
big challenge ahead I mean the this plot

463
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,919
shows energy energy consumption by

464
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:37,520
Electronics by the Microsystems we are

465
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,320
all building in in Orange compared to

466
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,840
the world's energy production and the

467
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,880
key message is that by

468
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,480
2040 the Microsystems we are all

469
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,679
building are going to be using 100% of

470
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,480
all the energy being produced in the

471
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,640
worldall no more energy for food no more

472
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,919
energy for transportation only only

473
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,279
energy to power

474
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,600
Microsystems that's not

475
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,720
good we need to fix that and and that's

476
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,120
an important call for action for this

477
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,279
community and for all of you and I'm

478
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,679
sure we will'll do it we'll succeed

479
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,120
we'll change the world

480
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,240
again so as we think of M

481
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,600
MTL in the next in the next few decades

482
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,760
we we want to to continue being 100%

483
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,799
focused on on the three

484
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,640
pillars that that we have developed over

485
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,360
the last few decades research community

486
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,080
and Outreach and I do want to give you a

487
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,799
a a few examples o of things we are

488
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,039
doing in in each one of these three

489
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,200
pillars and there are many more but I I

490
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,200
I had to select a a

491
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,559
few on the research

492
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,640
side as I mentioned we we are in the

493
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,679
most exciting time for micro systems in

494
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,720
all its history and our

495
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:07,799
community is really taking advantage of

496
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,840
that to build the

497
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:13,320
future professor akmed bahai professor

498
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,440
Alex shalik and myself are working with

499
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,640
the entire Community to build what we

500
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,760
call the the MTL program on Health

501
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,440
Sciences and

502
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,520
semiconductors to really use

503
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,960
semiconductor Innovations to invent the

504
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,480
semiconductor innovations that are are

505
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,240
needed to

506
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,480
provide personalized affordable and more

507
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,799
successful Health Care in the future and

508
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,760
Professor ammed bahai we will tell us in

509
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,960
a few minutes a a lot more details about

510
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,520
this new program which is based on

511
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,600
bringing microelectronics everywhere

512
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,080
throughout the the Health Care System

513
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,919
bringing ous sensors everywhere to

514
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,240
really improve the outcomes and make it

515
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,240
more affordable and personal

516
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,039
what Professor bahai calls waves beads

517
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,559
and

518
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,360
molecules another example of new

519
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,720
programs that are coming out of the MTL

520
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,720
Community as we speak is the MTL program

521
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,480
on a augmented reality and virtual

522
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,720
reality display Technologies which is

523
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:29,679
led by Professor Yan Kim to invent the

524
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,919
future of VR and AR are in close

525
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,159
collaboration with machine learning

526
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,080
experts and of course we are heavily

527
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,480
involved on everything related to to the

528
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:45,520
chips to the chips and science act here

529
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,320
in the US we are applying to to many of

530
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,799
the programs and heavily involved in in

531
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,240
all the projects

532
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,240
there at the same time we continue to

533
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,279
remain 100% focused on the MTL community

534
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,240
and understanding that the M MTL

535
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:06,279
Community doesn't stop in Cambridge it

536
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,880
has a national and international

537
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,279
footprint and we are very very proud to

538
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,240
to to play a an important role a

539
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,720
foundational role in the Northeast micro

540
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,200
Electronics

541
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,679
Coalition that was started a year ago

542
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,679
here in the

543
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,799
Northeast and the final example of

544
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,559
initiative that I I want to highlight

545
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,640
for all of you here is in

546
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,399
Outreach the future of our

547
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,880
field completely relies on us bringing

548
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,480
the best people to work in this field

549
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,120
and and for

550
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,360
that freshman students first year

551
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,640
students are are absolutely critical but

552
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,679
when I asked them a a a a few years ago

553
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,559
a couple of years ago hey what is

554
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,760
preventing you from from joining

555
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,519
Microsystems and and Hardware they all

556
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,760
told me the same thing you know when we

557
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,240
first joined the university we were

558
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,360
super excited about hardware and

559
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,960
Microsystems but then we applied as

560
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,159
first year students we applied to summer

561
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,760
internships to all the Microsystems

562
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,840
companies out

563
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,240
there and we got rejected from every

564
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,679
single Microsystems company every single

565
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:30,240
hardware company said the same thing

566
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:32,799
it's great that you are in interested in

567
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,960
Hardware however you are not ready

568
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,960
please apply again when you are a junior

569
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,399
or a

570
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,960
senior at the same time the same

571
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,880
students had applied to a wide variety

572
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,480
of software companies and they got

573
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,679
amazing internships in software

574
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,640
companies and at that point they never

575
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
look

576
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,440
back that's a problem not only for

577
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,120
Microsystems but for all of us working

578
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,399
in Hardware that's a problem that our

579
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,240
community at MTL wanted to to fix and

580
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:05,919
that is why we we created this program

581
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,399
the Northeast microelectronics

582
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,919
internship program which is connecting

583
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,159
first year students with summer

584
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,159
internships in in in the in the hardware

585
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,240
and Microsystems a field the first year

586
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:24,320
we got 100 students second year 200

587
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,840
third year 300 students going into the

588

450

590
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,720
applications from students who are

591
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,760
telling us hey we want to be in Hardware

592
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,240
we want to work in Microsystems we want

593
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,840
to join this exciting

594
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,120
field but we cannot do it alone we need

595
