1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,519
Okay, next speaker we move on to third

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,840
category the Nobel drug delivery system.

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
Speaker is Dr. Jacob Witten and Jacob

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,080
Witten is a postto fellow at professor

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Daniel Anderson's lab at co institute

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,119
for integrant cancer research. So his

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,680
talk today is advanced in deep don

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,800
particle for messenger RNA delivery and

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,080
focus on ionizable lipid designed by

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,480
using neural network. So Jacob, please.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,160
Thanks. Thanks everybody for coming. I'm

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,559
excited to talk to you today about my

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,920
work on uh developing better gene

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,280
therapies with AI. Um so just to start

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
off, you know, uh I'm going to be

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
focusing on developing development of

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,320
genetic medicines. I'm going to be

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
showing a lot of data in the lung. And

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
here's really the reason why is that

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,800
genetic medicine in particular uh could

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,879
address a a ton of critically unmet

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
needs in lung disease. And so that

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,199
includes things like rare genetic

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,120
monogenic diseases like cystic fibrosis

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,559
or primary silary diskynesia that

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
affects tens of thousands of patients

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,479
worldwide as well as more complex but

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,720
also more common diseases some of the

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,360
leading causes of death and morbidity in

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,439
the world including asthma, COPD, lung

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
cancer and adopathic pulmonary fibrosis

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
that affect millions or even hundreds of

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
millions of people. And in all of these

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
cases, we have a really straightforward

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
sense in in a lot of context just due to

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,439
our really extensive knowledge of

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,439
disease mechanisms and the genetics of

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,280
different disease of how we might go

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,000
about treating or preventing or curing

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,000
these diseases if we could deliver the

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,040
right genes to the lung in particular

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,280
the lung epithelium. And one of the nice

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,799
things features of the lung epithelium

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
is that it's relatively straightforward

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,439
to deliver high doses specifically to

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
the lung epithelium via inhalation

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,240
particularly a process called

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,040
nebulization where patients will inhale

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,720
a mist containing your medicine and

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
it'll go directly to the lungs. And so

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,720
when you get this nice local delivery

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,200
directly to the lungs, you get a you get

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,240
a high dose in the particular organ of

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
interest. uh and uh but then you get a

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
low systemic delivery so you don't have

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to worry nearly as much about the

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
systemic side effects and systemic

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
toxicity that you can see when you give

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
something like an introvenous uh gene

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
therapy. So this is really what we're

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,040
going to be targeting. Although a lot of

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,040
the techniques that I'm going to talk

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,720
about can really apply to many different

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,800
tissues and I will show a little bit of

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,239
data related to intramuscular delivery

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
for something like an intramuscular

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,480
vaccine. But anyway, so we have all

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,200
these diseases. We have all this sense

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,040
of the genetics of how we might modulate

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,599
the genetics via delivery of some kind

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,599
of gene and that would treat the disease

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,360
if we could actually go ahead and

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,560
deliver the gene to the lung epithelium.

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,400
And this turns out to be much more

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
difficult than was initially thought. So

76
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,680
um just to give a sense here of the

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,800
difficulty of the problem. So the CFTR

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,519
gene disco was discovered in 1989 as the

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
uh cause mutations in CFTR cause cystic

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
fibrosis. And to give a sense of the

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,720
expectations around this time and the

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
excitement when the CFTR gene was

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
discovered. We have this great quote

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,319
here that the expectation was all you

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
needed was to get a little bit of CFTR

86
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
to act in the lungs and hey press so

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
you'd have a Nobel Prize. Now, avid

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
followers of the Nobel Prize may notice

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,400
that there has not been a Nobel Prize

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
for gene therapy for CF. Um, and it

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
turns out it's a much more difficult

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
problem than it initially appeared. So,

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
uh, initial efforts focused on

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
delivering healthy CFTR to the lung to

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
get CFTR expressed using an adenoviral

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
vector after about eight years of

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,840
clinical trials. These were abandoned

98
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
due to basically no efficacy. Uh,

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
likewise, people tried adino associated

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,599
viral vectors for about eight years and

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
abandoned it. although those efforts

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,720
have recently restarted and we're

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
hopeful in the field that those are

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
going to go forward. Uh likewise, people

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,239
tried nonviral delivery of CFTR

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,480
expressing DNA via liposomes. Again,

107
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
after about 20 years, these showed uh

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,040
either very limited or no efficacy. And

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,799
so these trials were were abandoned. And

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,519
more recently there's been a lot more of

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,439
excite a lot more excitement around mRNA

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,000
uh lipid nanop particles much more about

113
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,519
which shortly and uh have a lot of

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,879
promise for delivery to the lung

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
epithelium for treatment of these

116
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,799
different diseases. Now of course mrna

117
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
lmpps also are not just useful in the

118
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
lung. The vast majority of you you know

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,280
me included have probably gotten uh

120
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,000
either the fizer or beyond uh fiser

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
beyond or madna mrna vaccines for covid.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,359
So you know we know that these things

123
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,120
work clinically and we know you know

124
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,360
that the they can be really useful and

125
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,680
really help patients. So this is really

126
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
the focus of my work is around lip and

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
nanoparticles trying to push lip and

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
nanoparticles forward as much as

129
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,840
possible in this uh but all throughout

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,160
the body particularly focusing on this

131
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,520
lung delivery space and so I thought I'd

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
first say you know what is a lipid

133
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
nanoparticle they're the most clinically

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,759
advanced nonviral gene delivery system

135
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,960
right with the mRNA vaccines and so

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,240
they're comprised of uh r well

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,560
subnucleic acid typically RNA mRNA in

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
particular uh mixed with an ethanol

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
phase that contains various lipids. So

140
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
it contains helper lipids, things like

141
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
uh ethanol uh things like cholesterol

142
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,720
and a phospholipid and a pegolated lipid

143
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
as well as kind of the secret sauce of a

144
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,960
lipid nanoparticle the ionizable lipid.

145
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
Now what happens is when you mix these

146
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,800
two phases together using some kind of

147
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,639
micrfluidic mixing system, you get a

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
nanoparticle. These nanoparticles have

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,880
to be stable in the lung mucous layer or

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,759
in serum or what have you and then get

151
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,360
taken up by cells in a process called

152
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,800
endoccytosis at which point uh they the

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
nanoparticles need to break out of the

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
endoome that's called endooal escape and

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
the nanoparticle can then disassemble

156
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
the RNA can be translated into whatever

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,800
therapeutic or antigenic protein you're

158
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,000
interested in. Now I promise much more

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,080
about ionizable lipids. So these, you

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
know, as as the name kind of suggests,

161
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
these are lipids that have an ionizable

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
head group and a lipid tail. Um, and

163
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
they're really critically important for

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,400
encapsulating the nucleic acid as well

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,479
as for achieving endooal escape and

166
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
uptake in the cell type of interest. And

167
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,240
so for a particular application, you

168
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400
really need to exquisitely tune the

169
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
chemistry of these ionizable lipids in

170
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,080
order to non-toxically deliver to your

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,680
cell types of interest. This is an

172
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,360
incredibly difficult problem, but

173
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,280
ionizable lipids have shown a lot of

174
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,759
promise for being able to do this. So,

175
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,000
just to give an example here, this is

176
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
SM102, the ionizable lipid found in the

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
Madna vaccine. And I'm just going to

178
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
highlight here the ionizable head group,

179
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,759
which has a tertiary amine. This will

180
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,319
become positively charged at low pH,

181
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,479
such as the pH uh of the endoome after

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,039
endooal acidification. This helps with

183
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,199
triggering endooal escape as well as a

184
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,120
lipid tail. And the precise uh chemistry

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,880
and structure of the lipid tail is going

186
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,960
to determine how effective endooal

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
escape is. So it's critically important.

188
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,800
And so the question really becomes how

189
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,360
do we find the right ionizable lipid for

190
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,280
each task. So SM102 is exceptionally

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,199
good as an intramuscular vaccine. That's

192
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,880
why it's you know approved for the the

193
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,240
COVID vaccine. But it turns out that

194
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
it's not quite as good at delivery to

195
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
the lung epithelium. We're going to need

196
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,840
to look for different chemistries there.

197
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,759
And so the Anderson lab uses a variety

198
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,919
of kind of high throughput screening and

199
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
rational design approaches to find

200
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,520
ionizable lipids for particular tasks.

201
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,199
But here I want to focus on the work

202
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
that we've been doing around AI for

203
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
design of ionizable lipids. So you know

204
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,680
AI as we probably all know is really

205
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,919
revolutionizing the life sciences. The

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
Nobel Prize for uh in in chemistry I

207
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,120
believe last year was given to uh deep

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,520
mind and the Baker lab for uh protein

209
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,039
structure analysis type of tasks. things

210
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,639
like using alpha fold for protein

211
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
structure prediction or using RF

212
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,080
diffusion for protein structure

213
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,759
generation. But this is not the only

214
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,400
place where AI has been really useful.

215
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
So for example uh people have used a a

216
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,759
machine learning paradigm called message

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,240
passing neural networks to design

218
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,039
antibiotics in silico that can attack uh

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
antibiotic resistant bacteria. And so

220
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,520
just in a in a general sense what it

221
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,680
takes to use AI to do something in in

222
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
the life sciences or really anything is

223
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
you need two things. You need a machine

224
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,960
machine learning architecture. This can

225
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,599
be you know a giant set of transformers

226
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,639
like is used in um in you know AI like

227
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,560
chat GPT or or quad or so on. Uh or and

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,319
you also need a large quantity of

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,720
training data and this is really why

230
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,720
protein structure analysis is advanced

231
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
so far. We have the protein data bank

232
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,800
which has hundreds of thousands of uh

233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
structures of proteins that we can train

234
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,199
a model to predict as well as huge

235
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
amounts of things like multiple uh uh

236
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,960
multiple sequence alignments and so on

237
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,440
that give information about structural

238
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,280
relationships between related proteins.

239
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,960
But when we don't have protein datab

240
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,800
bank we can still do our best to find

241
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
data sets and I'll talk about uh the

242
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
approach they took to to get those data

243
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,199
sets.

244
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,159
And so the um so the approach that I

245
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,760
took to design ionizable lipids uh is

246
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,839
something that I call lion or lipid

247
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,360
optimization using neural networks. And

248
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
so I said I needed two things. You need

249
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
training data and a model architecture.

250
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
So the model architecture is based on

251
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,920
something called the the the thing I

252
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,000
mentioned earlier called a message

253
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
passing neural network. And so what

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
happens here is you take the ionizable

255
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
lipid chemical structure. This can be

256
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
represented mathematically as a graph.

257
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,240
There's kind of a natural way to encode

258
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,240
the graph um as a vector. This is that

259
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
message passing uh neural network or

260
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
also known as a graphical neural network

261
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,040
sort of equivalent here. And this gets

262
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,399
mixed with various uh metadata about the

263
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
task that's trying to be accomplished

264
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,560
with an LNP formulation parameters. I'm

265
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,760
not going to go into the details uh too

266
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
much there though I'm happy to ask

267
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,000
answer questions. The so anyway the

268
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,760
output of the MPNN gets mixed with this

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
metadata put into a feed for neural

270
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,600
network and it outputs a predicted

271
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,680
delivery. So what you then do is once

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,519
you have a trained Lion model you rank

273
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,160
possible ionizable lipids. So you say,

274
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,839
"Okay, model, I'm going to make a an LNP

275
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,519
with this particular ionizable lipid or

276
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,440
that ionizable lipid, which is going to

277
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,080
have better delivery." And so the model

278
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
will will just rank uh different lipids,

279
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
and then you can take the ones that the

280
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
model likes the most, synthesize them,

281
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,839
and test them for delivery. Now, there's

282
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
our model architecture. I said, you

283
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,240
know, you need model architecture, you

284
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
need data. So here I uh it turns out

285
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
that you can actually scrape a ton of

286
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,800
literature from the data. those actually

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,080
never intended to be used for machine

288
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
learning, but we could nevertheless

289
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,800
adapt it as training data for machine

290
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,800
learning. So some that the Anderson lab

291
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
as well as other labs love to do is

292
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,279
screen large libraries of ionizable

293
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,600
lipids for mRNA delivery. So just to

294
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,120
take an example here, this is a library

295
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,760
uh sorry for the small text. I guess

296
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
I'll just voice it over. Um that was uh

297
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,640
many different ionizable lipids

298
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,959
generated with a three component

299
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,040
reaction between an amine, isocyanide

300
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,959
and a ketone. It's a nice high yield

301
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,880
predictable reaction. And so if you take

302
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,720
about 10 of each component, you get 10

303
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,959
by 10 by 10 or a thousand different

304
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
ionizable lipids. You can screen. What

305
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,720
they did was they screened all of them

306
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
for mRNA delivery in this case the

307
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
helila cells. And so this is just a heat

308
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,640
map of red is better delivery, blue is

309
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,880
worse delivery. And so we basically have

310
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,800
a thousand data points here. And you can

311
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,399
use this directly to say okay, which is

312
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
the best cyanizable lipid out of this

313
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
set. Or you can do what I did which is

314
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,480
take this data and use this training

315
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,760
data for uh for the lion model. And so

316
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
then what I did was I go to the

317
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,040
literature and I just find as many

318
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,040
papers as I can basically publish heat

319
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
maps scrape that data. Each different

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,880
paper here is is is a is a different

321
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,120
data set and then you just feed it all

322
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,160
into the lion model. Um and now you have

323
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,839
a fully nicely trained model. Okay. So

324
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
now we have our model and now we would

325
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,440
like to not just you know see how it

326
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,800
looks in silicon in a computer. We want

327
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,519
to actually make new things in the

328
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,200
world. Um and so uh I went uh worked

329
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,600
with a another chemist in the lab I

330
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,600
adjust Raji who came up with this uh

331
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,399
beautiful four component lipid synthesis

332
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,600
scheme again sort of ooi reaction base

333
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,120
with a ketone caroxilic acid amine and

334
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,760
isocyanide. These again react in a nice

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,920
predictable way and you get a gigantic

336
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,440
combinatorial explosion of possible

337
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,600
lipids that could be synthesized. Right?

338
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
So with about 50 of each component

339
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
commercially available, that's 50 to the

340
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,600
fourth different ionizable lipids that

341
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
could be synthesized. So a lot of

342
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
different options. And so here what I

343
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
did was I narrowed all those options

344
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,959
down. So I started with about 1.6

345
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,800
million candidate structures that could

346
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,760
in principle be synthesized with pretty

347
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,360
straightforward commercially available

348
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,240
components. Um and then narrowed that

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,399
down to 33 which I then screened in vivo

350
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,639
for intramuscular mRNA delivery just as

351
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,639
a nice simple uh pre-screening assay.

352
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,920
And then after a little bit more

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
optimization, which uh I'm not going to

354
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
bore you with the precise details here,

355
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,600
we ended up with these three key

356
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,240
structures, FO32, FO35, and EB66 that

357
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,519
were identified by

358
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,800
Lion. And so, first thing I wanted to

359
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
do, you know, I will get to the

360
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,079
respiratory tract, I promise. First

361
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,000
thing I wanted to do was just see how

362
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,600
these things look for intramuscular mRNA

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
delivery. This is kind of a nice thing

364
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
to do to look at how these uh how these

365
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,959
things might do for an intramuscular

366
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,240
mRNA vaccine. Um and so the data that

367
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,639
I'm going to be showing you for the next

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
few slides is luminescence data. So just

369
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,160
to describe a little bit what what I'm

370
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
talking about here, uh what happens is

371
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,839
you take mRNA encoding firefly

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,839
luciferase. This is the gene that makes

373
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,720
fireflies glow. And so you put it

374
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,760
package that in L&PS inject it

375
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,839
intramuscularly. Six hours later you

376
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,839
basically just see how much they're the

377
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,839
mice are glowing. And more glowing means

378
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
more luciferase protein was made which

379
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,040
means better transfaction. So higher

380
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,560
numbers are better in the data that I'm

381
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
going to be showing you here. And so

382
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,600
this is an example of what the raw data

383
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
looks like. You can just image these

384
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,519
mice live and they kind of will light

385
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,680
up. Red is lighting up more better

386
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,480
delivery. And so here I'm going to be

387
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,959
showing FO32 in blue and FO35 in red

388
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,800
comparing to solid circle controls. So

389
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,760
for example here I'm showing the madna

390
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,639
co vaccine formulation SM102 over here

391
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,959
on the right. and FO32 and FO35 are both

392
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
outperforming SM102 as well as this

393
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,720
highly potent preclinical benchmark that

394
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
we love to use in the Anderson lab

395
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
called CKK12. And this holds true across

396
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,240
four different orders of magnitude. FO32

397
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,480
and FO35 are consistently outperforming

398
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
uh at least matching or usually

399
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,720
outperforming the two different controls

400
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,600
that we were able to throw at and EB66

401
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,680
has also been quite potent as well.

402
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,279
Okay, so you know I promised respiratory

403
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,279
tract. Let's get to that. So first thing

404
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,639
I did was looked at intraasal delivery.

405
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,440
This is sort of a model of what you

406
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,279
would do as um an intraasal vaccine. So

407
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199
intraasal vaccines could potentially be

408
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,880
really good at generating sterilizing

409
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,040
immunity against viruses, be much better

410
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,399
at generating herd immunity. Um and so

411
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,839
you get uh less in the way of

412
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,839
breakthrough infections and that would

413
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
be really helpful uh for you know new

414
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
viral pandemics for example. Um so here

415
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,839
you have the mice inhale the nanop

416
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,600
particles basically into their nose

417
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,600
while anesthetized and then their noses

418
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
light up as you can see here. And then

419
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,320
when we quantify the data, we see that f

420
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,639
of 32 and 35 match or even maybe

421
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
slightly exceed every solid circle

422
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,079
control that we're able to throw at it.

423
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
And this includes the two controls I've

424
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,360
talked about as well as one that we

425
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,880
published on last year as being

426
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,639
specifically good for intraasal

427
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,800
delivery. So we're really exceptionally

428
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,160
potent here. And the next thing we

429
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,079
wanted to do was look at deep lung

430
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,000
delivery. So here we did oroaringial

431
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,320
installation where the mice inhale the

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,079
L&P basically into their deep lungs. And

433
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
so it's the same deal here. The lungs

434
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,839
light up. I'm showing representative

435
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,079
images of Xvivo lungs lighting up uh

436
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,880
with luciferase signal as well as seeing

437
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,320
that FO32 is outperforming every control

438
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,320
that we're able to throw at it whether

439
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
it's our standard set of controls or

440
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,760
L&PS that have been specifically

441
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
published for lung delivery by a factor

442
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,399
of anywhere between three and 10. So

443
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,639
this is really um really exciting. Um

444
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,160
and again FO35 is basically matching

445
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
matching our our best control. Um and

446
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
the next thing we wanted to do was look

447
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,279
at nebulize delivery to mice. So, as I

448
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
mentioned, nebulization, where you kind

449
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
of make a mist that the patient will

450
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
inhale in, is a really nice, gentle way

451
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
to deliver to actual human patient

452
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,920
lungs. They can do this at home with

453
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,240
home nebulizers. In this case, we're

454
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,760
nebulizing to mice. And here, what we're

455
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,600
seeing is ZO32 is able to match 11717.

456
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,839
This is a lipid I'll mention it briefly

457
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,320
in a little bit a little more uh that we

458
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,839
published on a couple years ago as again

459
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,600
being very specifically good for

460
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,360
nebulize delivery being state-of-the-art

461
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,959
for nebulization having very good

462
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,279
stabilization properties to the

463
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,800
nebulization process. So this again is

464
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,399
is really exciting showing that we're

465
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,079
able to match or exceed the

466
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,920
state-of-the-art and in basically every

467
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,000
test that we're able to throw at these

468
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,160
nanoparticles. Now one question that you

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
might be asking is what is lion actually

470
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,839
doing right? So, are we just making

471
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,560
minor tweaks to stuff that we already

472
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,560
know works, or are we potentially making

473
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,560
really new nanoparticles with new kinds

474
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,199
of chemistry that people might not have

475
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,440
thought of testing before uh before the

476
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,959
AI model basically suggested that? And

477
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
so to kind of answer that question, I

478
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,600
want to show some of the structures of

479
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,480
either FDA approved in the case of the

480
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,120
Madna or Fiser vaccines or al-Nam's MC3

481
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,160
lipid or highly advanced clinical uh

482
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,000
lipids. This is LP1 from Intellia and A9

483
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,320
from Achuatas. And the important thing

484
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,560
here is that these all have very very

485
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
similar chemical structures. In fact, I

486
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
believe some that I don't quote me on

487
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
this, but I believe some of them might

488
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,040
be suing each other over how similar

489
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,399
they are. Um, so don't quote me on that.

490
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm not 100% sure. Um so uh the the

491
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,680
important thing here is that these these

492
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,600
have basically uh very classic kind of

493
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
branched tails in a very straightforward

494
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
way that's known to help with endooal

495
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,799
escape. They tend to be either

496
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,319
completely saturated or have just a

497
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,160
couple uh cy double

498
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,760
bonds. Um and basically what they have

499
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
is these different lipids are variation

500
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,839
on this kind of branch tail branchtail

501
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,400
theme shot through Esther is the

502
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,360
occasional cy double bond and otherwise

503
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,199
saturated. And so the lipids here that

504
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,720
were designed by AI are actually really

505
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,280
radically different in terms of their

506
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
structure. So FO32 for example has an

507
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
alkine group which again you won't see

508
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,039
in these in these lipid in these really

509
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,840
advanced preclinical lipids or clinical

510
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,960
lipids I should say. And as well as FO35

511
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,240
and EB66 have these tarpine tails that

512
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,600
are really radically different from

513
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
anything that you see either in the

514
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
training set or in these kind of uh

515
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
clinical benchmarks. And so what what's

516
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,559
happening here is Lion is actually

517
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,160
picking out these really radically

518
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,400
different chemical structures, showing

519
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,559
that there's regions of chemical space

520
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,919
that had not been explored before, but

521
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,080
nevertheless are able to yield really

522
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,640
potent ionizing lipids, really potent

523
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,520
mrna delivery. So what I've shown you so

524
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
far is we can make mouse lungs light up,

525
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
right? But there's a couple of questions

526
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,760
here that are really important. Number

527
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,640
one, mice are notorious for not being

528
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,080
people. Uh many things work in mice that

529
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
turn out not to work when you scale the

530
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
people. And number two, it doesn't

531
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
really answer the question of what cells

532
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
are being transfected. And so to to get

533
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
at this question, I first want to just

534
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
back up a little bit and give you a

535
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
sense of what I mean when I'm going to

536
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
be talking about what cells are

537
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,600
transfected. Just a brief a brief point

538
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,000
on lung anatomy. So the lung is kind of

539
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,080
this fractally branching structure where

540
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,280
when you breathe in, air flows through

541
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,360
this fractal structure and into alvoli

542
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,440
where gas exchange occurs. And so the

543
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,600
lungs a little bit can be thought of as

544
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,600
like two organs that to oversimplify

545
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
somewhat where you've got the conducting

546
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,960
airways

547
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,799
um where air flows through and then the

548
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
respiratory airways with the alvoli

549
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,919
where gas exchange occurs and these are

550
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
very structurally and functionally

551
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,600
distinct. And so the conducting airways

552
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
this is where air passed through. This

553
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,520
is where you get mucous secretion. So

554
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,520
it's a major site of disease for uh for

555
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,520
things like cystic fibrosis, chronic

556
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,360
bronchitis, a major site for asthma.

557
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
Importantly, mice are exceptionally poor

558
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
models of the conducting airways. They

559
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
lack a lot of the physiology that a

560
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
human airway is going to have. The

561
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
industry standard here for studying

562
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,960
conducting airways is actually ferrets.

563
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,559
Um, now in the respiratory airways, uh

564
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,000
this is where gas exchange occurs.

565
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
You've got pulmonary surfactant and

566
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
alvolar macrofasages. So very different

567
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,080
from uh from the presence of mucus. It's

568
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,799
a major site of disease for things like

569
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,480
pulmonary fibrosis, alvolar proteinosis,

570
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
also a major site for asthma. And and

571
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,799
there's more diseases as well. And the

572
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
important thing here is while mice are

573
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
somewhat better models of alvoli I think

574
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,000
than they are for conducting airways

575
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,919
once again ferrets are a really really

576
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,360
good industry standard for pre-clinical

577
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,640
studies for studying the

578
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,559
alvoli. So we wanted to get at what our

579
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,080
nanoparticles are doing number one in

580
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,760
these sub regions of the lung and number

581
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,440
two in a more relevant model than mice.

582
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,960
And so to do this we collaborated with

583
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,960
University of Iowa which has these

584
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,120
beautiful reporter ferret models for

585
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,559
studying this kind of problem. And so

586
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,799
these are ferrets where every cell

587
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,280
expresses TD tomato so they're red. If

588
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,280
you deliver a pro if you uh get activity

589
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,760
of creep recominase it rearranges the

590
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,480
genome uh so that these cells instead of

591
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,160
expressing TD tomato now express GFP. So

592
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,880
transfected cells turn from red to

593
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,200
green. So the way this works is uh we

594
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,600
administer via microspayer LNP

595
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,840
encapsulating CRM mRNA and then two

596
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,520
weeks later we image the ferret lungs to

597
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,360
see what cells have been transfected in

598
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,760
other in other words what cells have

599
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,960
turned green and so here this is the

600
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,080
kind of whole lobe images um of ferrets

601
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,520
that have been transfected with

602
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,799
different LMPs and so we've got this

603
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,640
IR11717 that I mentioned before as being

604
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,240
really good for nebulize delivery here

605
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
we're not nebulizing but we wanted to

606
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,919
see what it could do in in a micros

607
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,960
sprayer as Well, as well as our two AI

608
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,320
designed lipids, FO32 and FO35. And so

609
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
now let's zoom in and see what these

610
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,480
things are actually doing. Um, so all

611
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,960
three L&PS, it turns out, are able to

612
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
transfect alvoli. So these kind of what

613
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,000
we're seeing here in these zoomed in

614
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,600
images is these kind of diffuse

615
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,520
squiggles that are turning green. The

616
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,360
diffuse squiggles, for lack of a better

617
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
way to put it, are what alvoli looks

618
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,039
like on histologology here. And we're

619
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,640
able to turn them green. So that's nice.

620
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,320
The next thing we want to look at is the

621
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,159
conducting airway epithelium. you know

622
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,679
the site of disease for a lot of mucco

623
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,919
obstructive diseases and what we see

624
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,679
here is really interesting. So, uh,

625
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,000
basically here what a conducting airway

626
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,240
looks like is a little kind of black

627
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,559
blob where air would be flowing into the

628
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,480
screen essentially and then the rim is

629
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,240
the conducting airway epithelium that we

630
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,840
want to transfect and it's basically

631
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
undetectable. And we can also just look

632
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,480
at the the trachea where it's the same

633
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,400
kind of thing just bigger. Um, and we're

634
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,960
basically unable to to detect

635
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,679
transfected lung epithelia um in the

636
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,120
conducting airways with the 11717 which

637
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
is interesting because it hit conducting

638
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,720
airways just fine in mice. again

639
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,520
reinforcing mice are not going to cut it

640
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,919
for this uh organ system. But FO32 and

641
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,240
FO35 are able to really robustly

642
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,840
transfect both the trachea and smaller

643
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
conducting airways as you can see from

644
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,120
the zoomed in images of these kind of

645
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,960
rims of these uh black blobs turning uh

646
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,760
green. And one really interesting

647
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,000
observation we were able to make is that

648
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,919
FO35 uniquely is able to transfect sub

649
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,039
mucosal glands. So sub mucosal glands

650
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,760
are very important for airway

651
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,320
homeostasis. um they secrete mucus, they

652
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,000
secrete amn microbial peptides for many

653
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,159
different diseases. These are the cells

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,840
that you really desperately uh need to

655
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,080
transfect if you want to have a

656
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,000
therapeutic impact on um on these

657
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,000
diseases. Something like cystic fibrosis

658
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,400
for example. So this is really exciting

659
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,799
to see. Um now ferrets are really great

660
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
but uh uh much like mice are not humans,

661
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,240
ferrets are still not quite humans. So

662
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,559
then we wanted to see what these things

663
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
could do in human cells. And so to to

664
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,360
look at this because we can't just treat

665
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,799
a human quite yet, uh we grew uh air

666
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480
liquid interface cultures. And when you

667
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,159
grow an airquid interface culture with

668
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
the appropriate media media using

669
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,120
bronchial epithelial cells, you can

670
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,280
generate something that looks very

671
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,640
invivo- like. So this is just an example

672
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,480
H& stain of an ALI culture that I grew

673
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
um where you can see dense silation on

674
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,960
top and something called a

675
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,799
pseudoratified epithelium very similar

676
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,720
physiologically to an actual stain of a

677
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,240
human trachea that you can see below.

678
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
And so we're really able to reproduce

679
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
the physiology of the conducting

680
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,400
airways. And so here in collaboration uh

681
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:21,520
with BEu which has a IPSC derived uh

682
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,559
cystic fibrosis uh air liquid interface

683
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,320
uh uh bronchilithelial culture model. um

684
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,799
we were able to transfect these ALI

685
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
cultures with Mcherry mRNA and turn a

686
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,640
lot of the cells red which means you

687
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,480
know we can uh transfect humanlike lung

688
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
tissue and you can kind you can also

689
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
kind of zoom in with confocal microscopy

690
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,280
and see things like siliated cells being

691
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,200
really robustly transfected um you can

692
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,880
we can also do this with primary humor

693
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,799
and airway cultures as we did

694
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
collaboration with the uh the CF found

695
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,520
cystic fibrosis foundation and here

696
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,080
we're able to see uh at our highest dose

697
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,520
transffection of about 4% of cells which

698
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,760
doesn't sound like much, but it's

699
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,159
actually very difficult to even get any

700
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,240
uh any detectable transfaction at all.

701
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,480
So 4% of cells is actually quite robust

702
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,320
for a single dose of these particularly

703
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
really really difficult airway cultures

704
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
to transfect. And that we can also look

705
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,640
at things like cell types. So here we're

706
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,039
able to transfect secretary cells which

707
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,960
is really useful for uh in particular

708
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,960
here for for for CF um but is also

709
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,799
useful for all sorts of other diseases.

710
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,360
Um and so to conclude here, you know,

711
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm uh I I think this hopefully shows

712
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,960
that we can really use AI to get a new

713
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,080
chemical space um you know, in terms of

714
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,520
ioniz that that we can actually do

715
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,440
really really important and really

716
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,159
really advanced pre-clinical work with

717
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,159
the lipids that AI is designing. Um and

718
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,039
with that I would like to thank uh my

719
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,960
adviser Dan and Bob and uh my

720
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,960
collaborators Rajie Manon and Sandra

721
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,279
Bartley in particular. Um and I'm happy

722
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,880
to take some questions. Thank you very

723
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,640
much. There you go. for questions.

724
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,400
Thank you.

725
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
Hi. Uh thank you for the talk. It was

726
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,840
really interesting and I really

727
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,120
appreciate it. Uh especially slide 13

728
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,840
which is where my question was about the

729
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,440
IP landscape. Um I am generally very

730
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,760
excited about L&PS and whenever I see

731
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,000
exciting uh data for especially invivo

732
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,760
reprogramming I want to try and include

733
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,679
that in our you know our workflow.

734
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,120
Um the issue I do come back to is the IP

735
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,240
landscape. So I think you are correct.

736
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,200
Last I checked uh Madna, Fizer and Alen

737
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,279
Lam are all suing each other and uh I'm

738
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,880
I'm an organic chemist formally trained

739
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
and those structures are very similar.

740
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,080
So it's going to be a long battle. Um,

741
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,200
so what I was wondering is could you is

742
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,159
is it feasible to

743
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,799
use published IP or a published patents

744
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,919
as a training set data to guide the AI

745
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,919
models away from murky I'll call it

746
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
murky IP space right now since it's

747
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,840
still in the courts. Yeah. Would that

748
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,760
bias it too much I guess? Yeah. So

749
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,200
there's two things that you could do. So

750
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,320
thing number one you can try to scrape

751
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
that data because they often actually

752
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,000
publish activity data in their patents.

753
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
So, I've thought about scraping these.

754
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,200
It turns out to be really difficult to

755
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,919
scrape. Like, I think with every new

756
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,840
update and, you know, GPT3, 44, quad 2,

757
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,360
3, 4, or whatever, I hope that finally

758
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,039
it's going to be good enough to scrape

759
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,320
to to scrape those patents to give me

760
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,600
more training data because I think

761
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
there's probably at least as much

762
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,840
training data in the patent literature

763
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,679
um as there is in in the kind of

764
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,440
peer-reviewed literature. The second

765
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,120
question of can you steer away from

766
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,799
patent space, you know, is a good one

767
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,480
that I haven't thought about too much. I

768
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,919
I I don't know why you couldn't because

769
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,320
it would be relatively straightforward

770
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,880
as you're kind of doing your incilico

771
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,480
screen of activity to also just do a

772
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,559
similarity score to everything found in

773
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,400
the literature if again you could decode

774
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,279
those structures which current image

775
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,360
analysis is very bad at turning images

776
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
of structures into like a smile string

777
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,159
that can be further processed. So

778
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,080
there's kind of just technical

779
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,360
limitations there that if I had either a

780
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,200
giant army of undergrads or GPT7 I could

781
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,840
probably handle but I have neither right

782
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,840
now. Thank you.

783
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Question.

784
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,520
Uh, hi. Uh, I was wondering if I

785
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,760
understood correctly. The model is

786
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,279
maximizing potency. I was wondering if

787
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,159
there's challenges with safety or

788
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,240
stability that can be messed up when the

789
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,039
potency is fixed by AI because it

790
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,200
doesn't seem like there's a And if I may

791
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,640
ask a second one

792
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,880
um I can wait. I I actually forgot my

793
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,400
second one. Okay. So So you asked two

794
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,159
questions. One about safety, one about

795
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,360
stability. So think about stability. You

796
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,799
know, if you're predicting activity,

797
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,559
being unstable is probably bad for

798
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,080
activity. So I expect that's kind of

799
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,000
wrapped up in there. But you know if

800
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,640
you're talking about things like

801
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,960
manufacturability or like kind of

802
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,400
stibility during shipment yeah that's

803
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,960
like a little bit of an unknown. These

804
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,080
problems generally can be solved if with

805
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,400
enough kind of like figuring out like

806
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
the exact optimal synthesis parameters.

807
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,440
The question about safety is also a

808
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,960
really important one because um you know

809
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
when you're doing endooal escape you're

810
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,480
fundamentally destabilizing membranes

811
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,880
and this is a dangerous thing to be

812
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,240
doing and so you often see more potent

813
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,480
lipids tend to be a little bit more

814
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,320
toxic and you know there's a sense to to

815
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,159
which the relevant question is not how

816
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,919
potent are you but how large is your

817
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,520
therapeutic window even if the lipid is

818
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,200
not very potent. If it's completely

819
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,640
non-toxic you could drink it like water

820
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,679
it doesn't matter so much if it's less

821
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,840
potent. Um so you know we haven't seen

822
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,039
like this is

823
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,799
like one thing to say is there really

824
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,240
isn't data to train a model on this kind

825
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,440
of thing. So we can't really train a

826
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,679
model on therapeutic window you um

827
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,520
number two we have not actually seen

828
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,440
significantly different toxicity between

829
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,919
this the these lipids and any other

830
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
lipids. So as of now I would say that's

831
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,880
like a gap but we haven't actually

832
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,760
observed it empirically being a

833
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,279
particular issue. Um if we had huge

834
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
amounts of safety data that would be

835
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,440
great but but but we don't. Um but these

836
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,960
lipids do seem perfectly safe as best we

837
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,320
can tell. Now I remember my second

838
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:58,600
question. Um so you know we just saw

839
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,200
Mona and Verex clinical

840
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,240
trial showing some tolerability issue

841
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,159
and this has been ongoing for any

842
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,039
inhalation any delivery to long for few

843
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,960
decades now. How much better is good

844
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,240
enough? Like you're increasing potency

845
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,600
and you're saying, "Okay, this is going

846
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,240
to be three times better, five times

847
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,480
better." But can we somehow make a guess

848
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,480
of how much better is good enough? Do we

849
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,760
need thousand times better or maybe five

850
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,159
times better? So I'm going to be really

851
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,039
interested in the data that both that

852
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,480
that Vertex Arcturus and Recode who

853
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
should all be publishing results this

854
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
year if not this half of this year are

855
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,080
showing in terms of measurement of

856
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,679
transfaction as well as 4D molecular

857
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,600
therapeutics and AEV company that's

858
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,200
that's doing nebulized trials. The short

859
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,520
answer is I don't know. There's a lot of

860
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,279
complexities around the biology of of CF

861
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,159
that make this difficult. So for

862
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,360
example, they may be getting very potent

863
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,039
transffection, but they're not getting

864
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,120
transffection this rare cell type called

865
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,120
the pulmonary ionosite. And so that

866
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
maybe is distorting chloride transport

867
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,039
in a way that attenuates uh kind of

868
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,559
clinical benefit. Or maybe they'll show

869
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,000
a clinical benefit and we're actually

870
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,080
there. Like it's very hard to say

871
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,440
without that kind of data. Um

872
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,279
uh and and it also may vary by by by

873
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,520
disease. Um

874
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,919
uh sorry your question is just how much

875
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,520
better do we need to do? Yeah. Um and

876
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,960
then but then but then also regarding

877
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,960
tolerability there's been some recent

878
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
results out uh that I think have been

879
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,399
really exciting on the tolerability

880
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,200
front understanding the effect of

881
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,120
membrane rupture on uh the induction of

882
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,960
inflammation and how you can attenuate

883
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,559
that. So for example uh the use of uh

884
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,520
galactin inhibitor called thiod

885
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,520
thiodalacttoside has has now been I

886
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,279
guess in a preprint has been shown to

887
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,120
really reduce but a printer that that I

888
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,799
trust that looks like solid data has

889
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,120
been shown to really reduce inflammation

890
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,279
driven by LMPS. So the toxicity is

891
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,120
really now starting to be zeroed in on

892
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,120
and there's going to be ways to reduce

893
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,080
it. So I don't think this this this

894
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,799
stuff with uh the like the effect of um

895
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,640
glectins following membrane uh rupture

896
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,720
that may be a major component of the

897
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,200
safety concerns and it also may be

898
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,240
fixable with these inhibition inhibition

899
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,559
of glection glectin or with selection of

900
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,880
ionizable lipids that use this different

901
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,480
uh membrane repair path called escort.

902
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,399
So there's starting to be a lot more

903
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,240
known about safety concerns and how to

904
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,000
actually assay them in vitro and in vivo

905
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,320
and how we can avoid them with ionizable

906
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,080
lipid design. Thank you. Last one

907
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,200
question. Oh, thanks. I had a related

908
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,120
question. Uh so this is really

909
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,480
interesting and again you seem you know

910
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,640
very focused on on where you're going to

911
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,240
get to select based on the delivery

912
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,000
method itself but one really key

913
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,679
challenge in drug delivery is actually

914
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,039
specificity of the delivery itself. So

915
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,120
I'm curious if you've thought about for

916
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,600
this model or for future work, how can

917
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,279
you focus on on specificity of delivery

918
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,679
to different tissues without having to

919
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,399
do very specific drug delivery like like

920
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,519
in the case of inhalation here? Uh so

921
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,279
you're talking about more are you

922
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,159
talking about kind of subtypes in the

923
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,679
lung like slead celus being able to like

924
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,399
introvenous delivery? Yeah, introvenous

925
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,600
delivery for targeted drug delivery. So

926
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,240
IV delivery um you know I've I've

927
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,440
thought about it uh on the AI side

928
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,120
there's not that much can be said

929
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
because we're a little bit data poor. I

930
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
actually think uh if the person from

931
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,399
Medicine Therapeutics is here they may

932
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,320
disagree but they're not sharing their

933
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,919
data set unfortunately. Uh but they have

934
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,159
some incredible data that that I've seen

935
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,840
in other talks. So stay tuned for that.

936
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,799
Um but you know in terms of organ

937
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,320
targeting right now it's uh more about

938
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
screening. There's a little bit of

939
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,440
rational design that can be done to tune

940
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,919
uh delivery between the liver and the

941
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,039
spleen and the lung. But a lot of what's

942
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,679
being done IV is more around rational

943
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,000
design with like antibbody or peptide uh

944
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,840
or small molecule conjugates to try to

945
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,039
target particular cells. So there's a

946
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,760
lot of interest for example in targeting

947
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,200
tea cells with CD3 or CD5 antibodies or

948
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,720
whatever else. So I would say uh for IV

949
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,760
you know hitting the liver is relatively

950
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
straightforward because the liver is

951
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,279
just a sink for all nanoparticles for

952
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,159
more uh for rare tissues and more

953
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,200
difficult tissues stem cells tea cells

954
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,320
whatever else this right now I would say

955
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,720
the most promising work is being done

956
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,120
with with antibbody conjugates um but

957
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,360
you do need to you do need to have the

958
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,880
right anti the right ionizable lipid for

959
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,080
a particular conjugate it's not

960
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,840
necessarily 100% % plug and play.

961
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,840
Thank you very much, Jacob.
