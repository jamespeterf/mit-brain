1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,279
okay so here we

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,279
are

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,160
uh

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,840
hi we're just starting yeah we are a bit

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,519
late

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:37,040
okay so

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:40,600
so today we um talk about liquid Vapor

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,600
uh equilibrium in

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,280
mixtures you we have seen something

10
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:52,840
already when we did the the Gibbs phase

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,840
Rule and

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:01,559
uh

13
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:04,479
you remember that um if we have U

14
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,200
if we consider the list

15
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,680
of properties of these properties like

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,280
temperature

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,320
pressure uh the

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,520
compositions of say two phases for

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,159
example a

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,960
liquid and a

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,920
gas

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,840
phase um depending on how many

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,960
components you

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,600
have uh R is the number of

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,680
components

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,880
plus

27
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:47,520
two uh minus the number of

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:51,360
phases this was called the variance

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,280
namely the number of these variables

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,920
that are uh independently

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,360
changeable uh so that you remain in the

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,479
same kind of uh

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
equilibrium like in this case we talking

34
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,640
about liquid Vapor but you could also we

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,840
also talk a little bit about solid

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,680
liquid and and you could also do it for

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,879
solid vapor and so

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,560
on um

39
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:19,360
okay of

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,800
course the chemical

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,800
potentials as usual will play major

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,640
role as they did in order to derive the

43
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,239
Gib space rule

44
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,239
so the first uh

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,120
uh result that we want to derive is the

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,000
R's

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,400
law R's law has to do with uh and we'll

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,200
do it for the simplest situation so the

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,519
simplest situation will be one uh

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,959
like one of these two

51
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:03,120
cases uh this one is a liquid a liquid

52
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:07,200
solution with compon components one and

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,319
two for example you can think of water

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,519
as being component one and two could be

55
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,360
salt so this is salt

56
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,920
water and it is in mutual

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,640
equilibrium with a a gaseous

58
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:28,480
phase in which there is also water so

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
one and there is another component three

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,200
for example it could be

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,799
air because humid air air has some

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,720
humidity and humidity is water

63
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:48,000
vapor so this is for example salt

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:50,239
water uh and humidair moist air in uh

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,040
Mutual

66
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,640
equilibrium we are considering the case

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,120
that um we will do this as a major

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,760
example in which

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,439
the uh other

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,120
component in this case air so the

71
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,159
molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in air

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,040
are

73
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,280
noncondensible so you do not find them

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,479
in the liquid

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,759
phase and

76
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,280
conversely the other component in the

77
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:30,120
liquid phase salt is nonvolatile so you

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,120
don't find it in the vapor f

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,160
that means that for Mutual

80
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,479
equilibrium it is required only that the

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,240
chemical potential of the component that

82
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,000
can be exchanged between the two phases

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,360
be equal so it means that the chemical

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,520
potential of water in the liquid must be

85
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,520
equal to the chemical potential of water

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,240
vapor in uh the gases

87
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,680
phas and this is one

88
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,360
example the

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:11,880
other is

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:14,440
uh liquid over a solid so again think of

91
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,919
water and

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,919
salt and this is

93
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:28,280
ice okay so again salt uh we assume is

94
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,039
not um

95
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,639
freezing so it's it's a solute of the

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
liquid solution but it doesn't

97
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:42,479
freeze and

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,039
uh and therefore we need only equality

99
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,960
of chemical potential of component one

100
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,560
between this and this and this actually

101
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,520
is not a mixture it's just a pure

102
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,520
component I mean this is just pure

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,039
eyes and of course the example

104
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,800
this example is

105
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:11,479
the is very practical for example when

106
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,280
you put salt in on

107
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:18,360
the uh side

108
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,240
walks um for avoiding freezing uh for

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,880
for changing the temperature at which

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,280
freezing

111
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,800
occurs and this is also uh you put salt

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,919
in water and that will change the

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,160
boiling pond point of this of the

114
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,960
solution so when you

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:42,319
make

116
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:46,319
pasta uh you and you have salted your

117
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,199
water the boiling point is not 100

118
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,599
degrees celus is just a little bit more

119
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,599
depending on how much salt you

120
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,800
put okay

121
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,599
so so how do we derive R's law

122
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,400
as usual we only need to apply the

123
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,560
equality of chemical potentials and then

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,400
uh manipulate the equations

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,800
somehow so uh let's say that we have two

126
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,440
phases that for the moment we call A and

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,879
B just generic fa two

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,199
phases so the chemical potential of

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,360
component one in Phase

130
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,000
a we going to uh

131
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,840
assume uh to derive R's slw ideal

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,479
mixture or solution behavior for all

133
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,800
components

134
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,479
uh or actually for this component not

135
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,960
for all components for this component

136
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,319
and

137
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,759
um so this is the

138
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,639
pure uh phase a pure component one plus

139
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:58,440
the RT the log of the mole fraction of

140
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:01,639
component one in in in the phase and

141
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,759
then we rewrite the chemical potential

142
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,840
at pressure

143
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,960
p we rewrite it by integrating the

144
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,639
derivative of the chemical potential

145
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:17,639
with respect to P from P to P

146
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,639
sat Pat being the saturation temperature

147
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:26,360
at which the pure substance at that

148
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:30,039
temperature changes or boils or

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,399
freezes okay so this uh we

150
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,839
so we rewrite this

151
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,640
as chemical potential at another

152
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,039
pressure and we pick the saturation

153
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,399
pressure and then we integrate the

154
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,480
derivative and remember that the

155
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,959
derivative is just a specific

156
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,440
volume and then we do exactly the same

157
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,959
also for the other uh phase

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,959
B just change the A's in

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,640
B's then we recall that when we have a

160
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,600
pure substance this is the reason why we

161
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,160
decided to use the the saturated

162
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,800
saturation pressures when we have a pure

163
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,959
substance the saturation pressure is

164
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,120
defined precisely by that pressure at

165
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,000
which at the given temperature the two

166
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
chemical potentials of the two phases

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,120
are equal so they are in mutual

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,079
equilibrium so liquid and Vapor for

169
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,640
example uh at the boiling point uh have

170
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,480
uh equal temperature equal pressure and

171
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,560
equal chemical potential but the three

172
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,120
are not independent and uh the equality

173
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,640
of chemical potential defines the

174
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,079
saturation uh pressure at that

175
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,880
temperature so that means that this and

176
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,519
that cancel because they are equal the

177
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,959
moment we equate the two chemical

178
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,800
potentials these two will cancel and we

179
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,200
are left with just the remaining terms

180
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,480
and so these remaining terms apart with

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,279
the logarithms that be put together the

182
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,800
logarithm of becomes the logarith of the

183
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,839
ratio of the mo

184
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,880
fractions and the integral you can put

185
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,000
it in this form is the integral of the

186
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,880
difference between the

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
specific volumes of the pure phases pure

188
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,480
substance in in the two different

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,680
phases so this is uh what you would call

190
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,880
vfg for example or

191
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,760
vjf it's the

192
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,360
volume of vaporization or freezing and

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,360
so on of the pure

194
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,600
substance so this

195
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,760
connects the

196
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,320
compositions of these

197
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,920
mixtures to

198
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
properties of pure

199
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,160
substance for example if we take uh uh

200
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,720
this case

201
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:10,120
where we have a air

202
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,880
on moist air on on on salted water then

203
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,560
for air we can assume the uh for the

204
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,200
specific volume we can assume the ideal

205
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,480
gas

206
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,120
law for the liquid we can assume liquid

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,800
water assume Inc compressible fluid

208
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,440
model so that the volume is constant

209
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,519
specific volume is constant

210
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:38,959
remember these are molar specific

211
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:42,680
volumes and then you do the integral

212
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,680
here so do the integral for for

213
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,560
the this is the part that contributed by

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,360
the fact that the volume is constant so

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,279
it's just a difference in the limits of

216
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,360
integration and the other is you

217
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,360
integrate DP over P so you get the

218
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,880
logarithm of

219
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,360
P so

220
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,360
this is the

221
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,519
result now it turns

222
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,279
out

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,320
that this term

224
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,360
here is much smaller than uh than one

225
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,519
and therefore much smaller than this

226
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:25,079
other

227
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:28,160
uh value which is the logarithm of RT *

228
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:31,240
the logarithm so

229
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,040
U if you neglect

230
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,800
that and you can compute it and and find

231
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,519
that for example even for very high

232
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,760
pressures and uh uh normal temperatures

233
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,199
uh for liquid water and typical

234
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,639
temperatures you this is of the order of

235
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:52,440
less than one

236
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,639
100 which is definitely enough lower

237
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,480
than one to be neglect

238
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,760
negligible and and so you neglect that

239
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,519
if you consider it it would be called

240
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,079
what is called the

241
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,320
pointing pointing effect the pointing

242
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:11,519
contribution so what we are doing is

243
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:15,040
currently is um um normally described as

244
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,040
neglecting the pointing

245
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,600
correction and pointing is a is the name

246
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,600
of a person

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,000
so the the end result yeah this is a

248
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,320
square bracket to

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,079
many uh we find that log and log can go

250
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,720
away and you get the ratio of the mole

251
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,600
fraction of water uh in the air so

252
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,320
that's the moist

253
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,120
content over the the more

254
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,199
fraction of water in the

255
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,079
solution and here it is a solvent so

256
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,880
it's the predominant uh

257
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:14,600
uh you you could also apply it for for

258
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:18,480
pure water in this case y1f is equal to

259
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,480
one then that is equal and this is R's

260
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,560
law to the ratio of the pressure over

261
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,720
the saturation pressure of pure

262
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,360
water this is the formula you can also

263
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,480
remember then that the since the for an

264
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,839
ideal

265
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,880
gas uh mixture um ideal Gibs Delton

266
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,680
mixture of ideal gas is the partial

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,560
pressure uh of the component is equal to

268
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,839
the mole fraction times the pressure of

269
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,560
the mixture this can also be written as

270
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
the partial

271
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,480
pressure and so the partial pressure of

272
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,639
the uh component one in the mixture is

273
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,800
equal to the mole fraction in the liquid

274
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,560
times the saturation pressure

275
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,560
of component

276
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,240
one if you apply the same formula here

277
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:16,440
equation one for the case of liquid and

278
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,360
solid F and J for

279
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,360
solid so that means

280
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,839
eyes both the volumes can be considered

281
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,759
constant so they get out of the

282
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,880
integral and so you have the difference

283
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,600
so the volume of freezing the change

284
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,800
that little change in uh density between

285
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:44,440
pure water and the ice that make so that

286
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,279
the ice floats on water that's the uh

287
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,480
volume of

288
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,600
freezing and

289
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:57,560
um and so R slw become takes this other

290
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,720
form so it gives

291
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:05,079
you um the mole

292
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,079
fraction of water in the

293
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,600
solution in terms of the difference in

294
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,279
pressure saturation pressure this time

295
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,360
this is the saturation pressure of

296
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:23,560
course of the liquid ice

297
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,199
transition times that volume of freezing

298
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,759
ided by

299
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,920
RT so with this you can

300
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,920
compute uh

301
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,199
these relations and these have to

302
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,160
do with the phase

303
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:43,000
rule so for example in this

304
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,000
case we have

305
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:52,279
U since it is a binary

306
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,279
mixture it has uh just two

307
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,519
components okay

308
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,400
but of

309
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:07,600
course of course uh

310
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,839
the second Mo fraction is is one minus

311
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,640
the the the first and so you have one

312
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,280
relation between these two and the same

313
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,720
another relation between these and then

314
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,799
we

315
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,679
have the relations between the chemical

316
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,199
uh

317
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,480
potentials that uh remove two other

318
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,720
relations and so you are left with the

319
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,440
fact that the moment you fix uh

320
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,960
temperature and the

321
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,200
pressure uh everything is

322
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,480
set so the mole

323
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,960
fractions are fixed like here you cannot

324
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
change

325
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,679
arbitrarily the mole fraction and still

326
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,679
uh stay in mutual

327
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,960
equili and here also you

328
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,600
cannot the ratio of the mole fraction of

329
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:10,240
the the of the liquid and the vapor is

330
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,240
is fixed by the given temperature and

331
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,799
pressure um you can

332
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,679
U interpret

333
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:30,559
u in a molecular

334
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
way uh the r law

335
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:40,080
see R's law says uh for

336
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:43,080
example here we are considering a a

337
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,360
different situation than the one before

338
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,159
in which um not

339
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:55,200
only component one but also component

340
00:18:49,159 --> 00:19:00,159
two can go um um Can can cross

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:04,080
phase so it it can be for example the FG

342
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:08,120
case it can be both volatile and

343
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,120
condensable as this would be for

344
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:20,039
example wine wine is a solution of uh of

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,159
alcohol and and um and water and when

346
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:27,480
you boil that you'll get a vapor in

347
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,280
which you have both alcohol and water

348
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,240
but they are in different

349
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,240
uh compositions so the mo when the are

350
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,039
in mutual equilibrium the mole fraction

351
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,760
uh of alcohol in in the liquid phase is

352
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,039
different from the mole fraction of

353
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,039
alcohol in the vapor

354
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,960
phase so R's law gives you which is

355
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,440
written here

356
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,480
again partial

357
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,400
pressure of say water is equal to the

358
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,760
mole fraction times the saturation

359
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
pressure and if you have two components

360
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,039
you have two RS slw one also for the

361
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,640
second component because now that also

362
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,440
component two can be exchanged you

363
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,559
should write also the CH equality of

364
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,440
chemical potential for that

365
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,440
component so you get a second

366
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,000
equation

367
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:29,200
and you see uh here

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,840
the the the the idea

369
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,400
the molecular interpretation is this if

370
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,679
you have a pure

371
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,679
substance at

372
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,760
equilibrium um there is somehow

373
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,400
uh an

374
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,280
exchange

375
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,120
um an equilibrated balanced exchange of

376
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,600
molecules that are in the vapor phas

377
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,240
that go down in the liquid and some and

378
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,280
an equal amount of molecules that from

379
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,280
the surface surf of the liquid go up in

380
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,039
the vapor phase and this is for

381
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,240
component one and this is for component

382
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:14,159
two now when you have a

383
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,720
mixture uh you see that on the surface

384
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:23,080
you have some dark and some gray uh

385
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,000
particles so the this Dynamic exchange

386
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,520
that occurs between the the liquid and

387
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,720
occurs

388
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:35,159
only proportional to the amount of of of

389
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,200
dark particles for the dark ones that

390
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,480
are on on the

391
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,480
surface so if you assume that the

392
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,320
fraction of particles that are on the

393
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,840
surface is equal to the mole fraction in

394
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,840
the liquid

395
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:55,600
phase then you see that the the partial

396
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:00,000
uh pressure which is driving which is

397
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,360
sort of driving this exchange with the

398
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,159
black

399
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,679
particles

400
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:11,080
uh is only limited by the by a fraction

401
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,559
which is the mole fraction by the

402
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,080
fraction with which they occupy the

403
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,320
surface and equally the other ones and

404
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,080
therefore uh since the pressures add up

405
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,559
um that's the uh that's the relation

406
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:32,440
that is one way of interpreting

407
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,440
this in any case when we have the two RS

408
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,159
equations we can usefully combine

409
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:45,480
them by using the obvious fact that the

410
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:50,159
mo fractions add up to

411
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:55,520
one so for example I could add this and

412
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:58,559
that if I add these two you see y1g +

413
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,080
y2g is one so I remaining I'm remaining

414
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,720
with P so so I obtain this pressure this

415
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,360
expression that the pressure is equal to

416
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,400
this plus that and of course instead of

417
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,799
Y2 I write 1 minus YF this is called the

418
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,799
bubble

419
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:22,000
line it expresses for a given uh

420
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,039
pressure and temperature the composition

421
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,720
of the liquid

422
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,039
phase so if I give you the temperature

423
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,520
and the pressure you can compute the

424
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,039
mole fraction

425
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:37,039
y1f uh because you can go on the tables

426
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:40,440
of the pure substances for the

427
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:44,279
pat of the two substances and then with

428
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,000
this equation you you solve for YF

429
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:51,279
y1f

430
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,120
or if you would

431
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:59,039
um you if you

432
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:01,960
sum if you solve this equation for y1f

433
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,840
and y2f and then sum up so that it's

434
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,640
equal to one this is the other

435
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,440
expression that you

436
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,440
obtain this is a du line it contains uh

437
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,559
the relation that gives you uh that

438
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,840
allows you to solve for the uh mole

439
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,600
fraction of component one in so the

440
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,399
composition of the

441
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:30,360
vapor at

442
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,360
uh in the two-phase stage

443
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,000
okay and of course once you have the the

444
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,880
B the bubble Line This is really an

445
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,200
equation of a line so you see that if

446
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,760
you plot pressure versus mole

447
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,840
fraction and in this case we're talking

448
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,960
about if you're doing this equation here

449
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,360
it's the mole fraction of the

450
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,880
liquid uh you get you get a straight

451
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,000
line that we call the bubble line and so

452
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,760
for a given temperature and a given

453
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,200
pressure you go here and read the mole

454
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,360
fraction of the

455
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,840
liquid the DU

456
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:14,399
line is not a straight line because it's

457
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:18,080
one / P that is linear in

458
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:20,080
y so it has this shape and so for a

459
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,919
given uh for that temperature and the

460
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,080
given pressure you go down here and read

461
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,399
the mole fraction of the vapor of course

462
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,640
you you can eliminate pressure from the

463
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:33,799
system of these two equations and then

464
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,039
you get a direct relation between the

465
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,679
composition of the vapor phase and the

466
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:41,600
composition of the uh liquid

467
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,399
phase where

468
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,120
the where what counts is the ratio

469
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,840
between the saturation pressures of the

470
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,559
two substances which is called the

471
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,559
relative

472
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,520
volatility and here is a plot so this is

473
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:05,039
y f y1f this is y1

474
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:09,159
G and this is how that equation

475
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,720
looks of course remember that here if

476
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,679
you have if we have written

477
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,159
this for both substance one and

478
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:20,159
substance

479
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,360
two uh it it means that we have assumed

480
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,320
that at all

481
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,880
compositions the liquid behaves as an

482
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,480
ideal uh solution

483
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,640
is

484
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,600
ideal solution yes and

485
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:41,600
so this is a very strong assumption

486
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,440
because most uh liquids do not uh behave

487
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,919
like

488
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,480
that but still this is a sort the

489
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,960
starting point so that's how the bubble

490
00:26:49,480 --> 00:27:00,240
line and the D line uh look for uh an

491
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,240
ideal model completely ideal model

492
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:12,120
and that is enough to give an idea

493
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:16,200
what what is done when we when we do

494
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,520
distillation um you see this plot is

495
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,679
done at constant

496
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,520
temperature because it's easy because

497
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,399
you fix the temperature you go and read

498
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:29,840
the saturation pressures from these

499
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:32,840
lines of course I can do also

500
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
uh

501
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,720
numerically a plot in which I fix the

502
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,159
pressure and then for each temperature

503
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,480
so if I fix the

504
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:50,080
pressure for each temperature there uh I

505
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,919
have to go and read the values that will

506
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,640
give me the mole fractions and I do a

507
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,799
plot and a plot will generally not

508
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:04,279
produce uh straight lines any any longer

509
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:04,279
if it is a plot at fixed

510
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,640
pressure this is more useful because um

511
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,559
mostly uh you you boil things at at a

512
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,399
fixed

513
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,760
pressure so here's the uh

514
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:29,159
idea so we got the the bubble

515
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:32,120
line um in the D the D line sorry um

516
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,919
the D line here and the bubble line here

517
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,919
so uh

518
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:46,080
we suppose you start with a mixture in a

519
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:50,399
liquid phase at this composition say

520
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:56,519
50/50 and uh I hit it up at certain

521
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:59,039
point I reach the bubble line and uh the

522
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:02,000
first bubble gets

523
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,720
uh boiled

524
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,480
off that bubble is in equilibrium with

525
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,720
my saturated liquid and has a

526
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:13,600
composition which is

527
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,960
here it has a different composition and

528
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,799
we computed by that formula that we have

529
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,320
uh derived based on the

530
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,360
relative

531
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,840
volatility of course you can express the

532
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,200
relative volatility as ratio of

533
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,440
pressures but it's it's also related to

534
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,000
the ratio of the saturation temperatures

535
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,640
because this T sat of p is the inverse

536
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,159
function of P sat of

537
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:47,919
T okay if I keep U uh heating

538
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:50,120
up for example I have an equilibrium at

539
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,240
this

540
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,399
temperature and for an equilibrium at

541
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,279
this

542
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,080
temperature the the bubble line gives me

543
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,279
the mole fraction of the liquid and the

544
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,960
the due line gives me the mole fraction

545
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:04,399
of the vapor again for following this

546
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,559
this

547
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:12,039
expression if the temperature goes

548
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:16,000
up up to here I have saturated

549
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:20,000
Vapor which is in equilibrium with the

550
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,279
first or say last drop of uh liquid so

551
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,519
this saturated Vapor then if I still hit

552
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,519
it up it will go up

553
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:35,000
okay so the idea is this if

554
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:38,600
I if I start with a composition like

555
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,600
50/50 and I want to

556
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,240
separate what I could do is to go up to

557
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,960
this temperature here like an

558
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,600
intermediate temperature between the

559
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,760
temperature the saturation uh liquid

560
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,760
temperature and the uh saturation Vapor

561
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,639
temperature and notice

562
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,679
that where as for a pure

563
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:04,279
substance

564
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,720
the

565
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,519
the the DU line and the bubble line

566
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,159
coincide and there is only one

567
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,720
temperature at which uh the pure

568
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:21,600
substance becomes liquid and is also uh

569
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:25,200
saturated so if you so this uh lens

570
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:29,399
shaped thing will reduce to

571
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,399
just a line

572
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,039
but

573
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:37,399
here uh the boiling occurs over a range

574
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:39,880
of temperatures between this and

575
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:44,080
that this is not only for liquid and

576
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,440
solid for example in also uh Metals if

577
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,440
you go

578
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,760
metalurgy this would be solid this would

579
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,039
be liquid and this would be the

580
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,559
solidus uh temperature and that's the

581
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,799
liquidous temperature and this Gap uh

582
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,200
is is like

583
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,279
here okay so let's say we we we we put

584
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,880
the

585
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,919
temperature we are at the temperature

586
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:15,120
intermediate between the liquidus and

587
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:19,399
the vaporous so to speak temperature

588
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:23,279
then you see that the two phases are

589
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:27,880
one uh enriched in component two and the

590
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,880
other en reached in component one

591
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,600
so this is what happens in one stage of

592
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,360
a distillation

593
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,799
column then what you do is you take the

594
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,720
liquid and you set it you send it down

595
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,639
to another

596
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,679
stage which works at a different

597
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:53,519
temperature and then you you take uh the

598
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,639
the vapor and you send it up to uh

599
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,600
condense into the

600
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:04,639
uh uh upper

601
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:07,600
stage and so on so that uh

602
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:11,559
eventually you can

603
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,320
um you see since you in the upper level

604
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,880
you

605
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,279
collected a mixture which is more rich

606
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:24,120
in in

607
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,120
in in um in

608
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:31,559
alcohol then

609
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:35,039
you could uh play the same game go to an

610
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:39,760
intermediate temperature like this one

611
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:43,840
and then you generate an even more

612
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,080
enriched um vapor and so on you can

613
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,399
continue as much as you need in order to

614
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:56,000
obtain um up to

615
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:59,240
99% uh for example this is how they get

616
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,480
96 uh

617
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,480
volume percent alcohol that is used to

618
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
make

619
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,040
liquers

620
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,159
okay all right so this is for

621
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,480
distillation

622
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,760
principle now

623
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,800
another thing that can be explained by

624
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,599
ral's

625
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:31,399
law is as I mentioned this idea that uh

626
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,399
this fact

627
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:41,040
that when you add salt on water that

628
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,119
water will freeze at a lower temperature

629
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,040
than zero

630
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,839
Celsius or when you add salt in water

631
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,280
that water will boil at a higher

632
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,280
temperature than 100 degrees

633
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,440
celsus how do we derive that okay okay

634
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,599
we start from the routs law for the

635
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,680
specific case so this is the the routs

636
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:11,560
law for the uh liquid eyes case that we

637
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,560
have seen couple of slides

638
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:18,760
ago and we

639
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,760
take the differential of

640
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:27,320
this and

641
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:30,800
then realize that uh when we take uh the

642
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:34,000
different itial of

643
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Pat we

644
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:40,079
actually this is a pat of the pure

645
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,599
substance so for the pure substance we

646
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:49,240
can remember the Claus claperon relation

647
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:52,400
that gives you the slope of this curve

648
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,720
on the PT diagram this this is the the

649
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,319
saturation pressure curve and the slope

650
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,400
of that curve is the is given by the

651
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,079
closes claperon relation and it is

652
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,760
related to the enthalpy of a change of

653
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,000
phase divided by the volume of the

654
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,440
change of phase it's it's actually it

655
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
should be the entropy of the changes of

656
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,720
phase divided by the volume but the

657
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,079
entropy of the change of phase is equal

658
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,400
to the enthalpy over the temperature of

659
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,040
the change of

660
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,800
phase so you use this in this

661
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,319
relation

662
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,760
neglect

663
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:33,079
um this term

664
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:37,200
here if which is good if if you have a

665
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:40,119
dilute solution therefore the mole

666
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,960
fraction is close to one and therefore

667
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,440
the logarith is close to

668
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,520
zero and you're left with these three

669
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,880
terms then if you consider that you're

670
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,400
not changing the

671
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,920
pressure so if you remain at constant

672
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,839
pressure and change the

673
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:03,440
composition of uh of the

674
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,200
solution this relates this tells you how

675
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,760
the temperature will change so

676
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,200
essentially from this equation DP you

677
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,000
can compute the derivative of t with

678
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:16,440
respect to a change of mole fraction of

679
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,280
constituent one but the change of mole

680
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,200
fraction of constituent one is also

681
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,240
equal to the negative of the change of

682
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:28,079
the constituent two this case the

683
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,680
salt and uh and and then you have a

684
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,920
H and

685
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,000
RT so in the end you

686
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,480
find that

687
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,680
the if you add a little bit of salt to

688
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,800
the liquid

689
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,839
solution the temperature at which you

690
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,160
have equilibrium therefore the freezing

691
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,160
uh

692
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,960
temperature is

693
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:59,240
changes from before by an amount that is

694
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,119
related by these things RT squ the

695
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,400
enthalpy so all properties that you can

696
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,359
look up for the pure substance with a

697
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,480
minus sign so this is the uh freezing

698
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,960
point

699
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,960
depression uh

700
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,640
case and you can you can also plot it on

701
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,400
this diagram so if you have a

702
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,480
solution

703
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:30,520
U here I enlarge this area so the black

704
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:34,839
curves are the pure substance if you add

705
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:38,839
a little bit of salt in the solution

706
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:43,400
then this black curve shifts to the blue

707
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:43,400
curve at lower

708
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:51,240
temperature and then also the same for

709
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:55,040
the other side for the

710
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,960
uh for the other case liquid over Vapor

711
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,200
so

712
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,200
boiling of a uh salted

713
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,839
solution here we have to start from the

714
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,640
rout law written for these two phases f

715
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,400
and

716
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,480
g which is this one again we do the

717
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:18,560
differential again we use the clus clap

718
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,800
relation and again we obtain uh a

719
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,920
partial derivative of T at constant

720
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,040
pressure

721
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:31,440
uh how that boiling temperature changes

722
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:34,400
when you add a little amount

723
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,839
of component two which is the salt this

724
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,680
time you have a plus sign the

725
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:41,000
ingredients on the left hand side that

726
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,440
look similar except that of course you

727
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,200
have to put

728
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,920
here the enthalpy of vaporization

729
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,480
whereas here you have the enthalpy

730
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,640
of

731
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,720
melting and the plus sign so the curve

732
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,079
the shift is on the right so the boiling

733
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,079
temperature is

734
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,240
higher

735
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,960
actually

736
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,440
um

737
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,040
these

738
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,040
boiling and freezing

739
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:24,119
effects can also be

740
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,880
used as means to measure and are

741
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,960
actually used as means to measure the

742
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,240
Sal content for example you take sea

743
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,920
water and if you want to measure the

744
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,560
salt content you run the experiment of

745
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:42,440
freezing it and boiling it and then uh

746
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:47,160
with that you can compute uh you see

747
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:51,480
here by measuring the delta T and

748
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:56,359
uh that is related to the amount of uh

749
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:59,000
of um of salt that is salt content and

750
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,520
therefore you you infer from that

751
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,119
measurements those measurements

752
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,119
these composition and salt

753
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:15,400
content

754
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:18,839
okay okay the problem is that of

755
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,839
course ideal

756
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,680
mixtures are good

757
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,960
models for the gasos

758
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,200
phases not so good for the liquid

759
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,560
phases and therefore not so good for the

760
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,800
liquid equilibrium cases we are

761
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:43,319
interested in because uh the reality is

762
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,319
more complex than the ideal

763
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,440
models so we remind ourselves of some

764
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,319
results that are useful uh any in any

765
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,960
problem with mixtures it's going to be

766
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,240
useful here

767
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,480
and they are going to be useful also

768
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,880
from I think the next time we will start

769
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,359
the systems with chemical

770
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:14,119
reactions and these and these

771
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,200
expressions are uh important namely that

772
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,440
the the properties are given by the

773
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,839
weighted sum weighted on the amounts of

774
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,839
the partial

775
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,559
properties the lower case with this with

776
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,559
with a single subscript

777
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,599
and then these partial properties can be

778
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,119
related to

779
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:42,839
the specific properties of pure

780
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:46,599
substances if you add what we called the

781
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,599
um the mixing

782
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,680
property but uh now what I want

783
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:59,760
to uh go back to is this result that we

784
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:02,040
haven't uh um used yet it's the D

785
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,960
margules

786
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,200
relation that we obtained when we did

787
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,040
this for the simple for the simple

788
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,040
system it was one of the

789
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:21,040
various say byproduct of this

790
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,040
derivation so the do margus

791
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,119
relation can is is this one

792
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:39,119
and is important when you try to uh

793
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,559
develop uh models for non ideal behavior

794
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,079
of the stable equilibrium State

795
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,720
properties of

796
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,319
mixes why is it important because it

797
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,960
imposes

798
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:53,079
um uh in rules about the interrelations

799
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,359
that must

800
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,599
exist you see this is a system of

801
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,760
equations it's not just one

802
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,760
there is one for every

803
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,359
component and so it's not that

804
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:12,800
you you see when you want to uh model

805
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:17,400
properties of substances you have to uh

806
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,400
come up with

807
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,319
correlations for these functions

808
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,920
and you might be tempted to use any sort

809
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,960
of

810
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:41,119
analytical uh form of these inter

811
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,200
relations but do margules says no or at

812
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,000
least you you may try but you should

813
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,880
check the consistency with this relation

814
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,880
because not all relations are good for

815
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,359
that purpose because some

816
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,359
violate this

817
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,839
condition actually this condition

818
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:03,800
remember that mu I comma J is the

819
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,920
derivative of the chemical potential of

820
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,680
component I with respect to the amount

821
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,319
of component

822
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,680
J and so it is a second derivative of

823
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:17,200
the Gibs free energy with respect to two

824
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,079
different uh um

825
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,079
components or also equal

826
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,200
components now you can view this uh

827
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,880
system of this system of equations as a

828
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,160
homogeneous uh system of linear

829
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:45,160
equations in the unknowns

830
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:47,440
n where uh mu i j is the Matrix of uh

831
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,920
the linear

832
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,400
coefficients and if you if you go back

833
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,520
into your math courses you will find

834
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,400
that the system of homogeneous equations

835
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,079
has a solution only if the

836
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,640
determinant of the Matrix of the

837
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:07,720
coefficients is equal to

838
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,720
zero so but this

839
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:17,240
determinant in this Matrix is the Matrix

840
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:20,319
that is that we called the uh H because

841
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:23,400
you see it's the Matrix of the second

842
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,720
derivatives and its

843
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,520
determinant is also something that we

844
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,800
have encountered it's the

845
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,119
Jacobian of the chemical

846
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,680
potentials with respect to the

847
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,280
compositions of course done at constant

848
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,559
T and

849
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,440
P so you need that Jacobian to be equal

850
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:48,079
to zero so that is the condition so you

851
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,480
cannot arbitrarily select these

852
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,760
functions you have to check that that

853
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,760
Jacobian be equal to

854
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,240
zero for example

855
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,880
as you

856
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,880
know we have

857
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:14,599
decided to call this functional

858
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,599
relation uh the

859
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,480
ideal so and in fact we're going to call

860
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,240
this

861
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:28,240
uh new I

862
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:37,599
idea of t p and Y this is a particular

863
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,599
functional

864
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,359
relation so we have to

865
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,920
check that um it

866
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,720
satisfies the do

867
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,960
marulas theor or

868
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,559
relation so here is the ideal

869
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,559
mixture

870
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,599
assumption uh so in order to do this uh

871
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,839
this derivative Computing this

872
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:15,960
derivative you have to

873
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:15,960
be a bit careful in do in doing those

874
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,920
derivatives

875
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,839
uh I think I forget now if we have done

876
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,000
this already but uh um the the key Point

877
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,640
here is that you have to take the

878
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,400
derivative of mu with respect at fixed

879
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,400
temperature and pressure so this doesn't

880
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,920
contribute it's only the logarithm of

881
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,559
the mole

882
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:45,240
fraction so the logarithm of the mole

883
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:50,200
fraction you have to take its

884
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,200
derivative with respect to the uh

885
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,480
njs okay so NJ now NJ

886
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:03,000
it's easier to write it this way so I'm

887
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,839
taking the derivative with respect to

888
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,799
NJ of the logarithm of the mole fraction

889
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:12,559
the mole fraction of component I is n

890
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:15,440
i divided by the

891
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,720
sum of all the NS

892
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,720
let's use another subscript

893
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:26,119
K all right so that

894
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,319
means that sometimes you find uh you

895
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,680
have a contribution

896
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:33,920
ution of the numerator When J is equal

897
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:39,440
to

898
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:44,640
I and that's why I use the chroner Delta

899
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,640
and then uh that contribution is simply

900
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,640
uh what one over the mole

901
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:58,280
fraction okay something like that

902
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:15,440
and sorry not uh correct it's and

903
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,240
subai because it's the

904
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,799
logarithm the derivative of the

905
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,559
logarithm is one

906
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:25,400
over the the

907
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:28,359
argument and then

908
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,720
uh sometimes

909
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,440
the derivative picks up something from

910
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,000
the denominator the denominator this

911
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,799
could be viewed as that is a constant so

912
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,720
that is a log minus log of the of of

913
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:47,040
this so it would be minus

914
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,040
one over

915
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:54,960
n yeah so that's written here now that

916
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:58,520
you've taken this this

917
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,000
derivative you can substitute itute into

918
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,359
here so you sum over

919
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,359
n and verify that indeed that is equal

920
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:09,480
to zero

921
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:12,880
identically so

922
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,000
obviously people have been careful in uh

923
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,880
uh D people and also ourselves when we

924
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,680
derive this we did it using the rules of

925
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:27,559
the game and therefore it does uh obey

926
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:29,920
the uh the marulas D marulas relation

927
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,440
but when you when you start uh uh

928
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,640
correlating experimental data for non-

929
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:40,480
ideal

930
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:44,680
Behavior you have to be uh careful in U

931
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:47,880
cooking up uh functional relations that

932
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,880
are U

933
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:54,079
compatible and this uh if you remember

934
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:58,000
now that so

935
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:01,480
um here it is so if we write we're going

936
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,160
to decide to write uh the

937
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:07,599
actual chemical potential as a sum of

938
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,440
the ideal

939
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,839
plus excess so in other words we we are

940
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,079
going to call excess chemical potential

941
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:19,119
the difference between the actual

942
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:21,000
chemical potential and what uh uh and

943
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,200
this ideal

944
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,640
one so essentially we're going to

945
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:31,680
say for the real

946
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:34,920
uh substance for for the real

947
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,920
mixture we

948
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:41,920
need to Define how the behavior departs

949
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:46,720
from

950
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,720
ideal and this is called excess chemical

951
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,240
potential or remember also

952
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,240
this more

953
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:59,799
the uh

954
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,040
chemical potentials of the pure

955
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:06,000
substance are

956
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,000
equal to the Gibs free

957
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:15,599
energy so the to the specific GS free

958
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:18,599
energy this will come

959
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,599
up

960
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:27,359
also uh

961
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:30,839
since we have defined uh these

962
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,839
properties of uh of

963
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,160
mixing by the way we Define them it

964
00:53:35,319 --> 00:53:41,680
turns out that what we decided to call

965
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,960
the excess chemical potential is equal

966
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,880
to the difference between the enthalpy

967
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,079
of

968
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,960
mixing and the entropy of mixing

969
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,960
multiplied by the

970
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,280
temperature not quite

971
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,640
only that part of the entropy of mixing

972
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,839
that is not already included in the RT

973
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:12,880
log of

974
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:17,200
Y so you see here we call that the Delta

975
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:23,200
s x so it it is an

976
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:25,920
excess entropy of mixing because in the

977
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,160
ideal solution there is a mixing effect

978
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,720
that counts for that remember the

979
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:34,520
surprise discussion uh counts with that

980
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,040
R log of of Y this is the surprise and

981
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,839
this is an

982
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:44,040
entropy a part of the

983
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:47,280
entropy of of the mixing entropy it's

984
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:51,119
the only mixing entropy that we

985
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:56,880
have uh under ideal behavior and you may

986
00:54:51,119 --> 00:55:00,599
have some extra some excess one

987
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,559
so that's why we call we say here

988
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:06,720
chemical potential

989
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:09,680
excess is equal to the entire enthalpy

990
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,960
of mixing because for the ideal mixture

991
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:16,280
there is no enthalpy of

992
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:20,079
mixing and only this uh excess part of

993
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,079
the entropy of

994
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,480
mixing

995
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,480
Okay so with that in

996
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:35,960
mind of course the another thing that we

997
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:39,760
should remember is that the Gibs free

998
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:43,359
energy if we are interested in the Gibs

999
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,200
free energy of our entire mixture that

1000
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,200
is equal to

1001
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,640
um to

1002
00:55:53,240 --> 00:56:03,079
this and so if you want you can also

1003
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:05,839
Define parallel with the fact that we

1004
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,720
decided to write the chemical potential

1005
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:13,119
as

1006
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:18,599
mui ideal plus mui excess you can also

1007
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,599
plug that into here and obtain

1008
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:28,240
a overall mixture uh gives free energy

1009
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,240
as a sum of an ideal part and an excess

1010
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,559
part with that in

1011
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:41,920
mind here is for example for a binary

1012
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:46,200
mixture let's

1013
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,200
fix this limit for

1014
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,280
ourselves binary

1015
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,240
mixture uh here is the expression for

1016
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,680
the um

1017
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:00,200
specific gives free energy so now if I

1018
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:04,079
take this

1019
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,079
G and divide by

1020
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:13,359
n that gives me G Over N

1021
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,599
okay of course that summation becomes

1022
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:19,400
the mole fractions weighted chemical

1023
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:24,960
potentials and this becomes

1024
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,960
G Plus g x

1025
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,799
now

1026
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:44,319
G is therefore the weighted sum of the

1027
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,720
ideal chemical potentials weighted on

1028
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:49,079
the mole fractions and the ideal

1029
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,079
chemical potentials are these

1030
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:58,520
ones so if I take that let's see if I

1031
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:01,160
can do this game like this take the

1032
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:04,799
weighted sum of these

1033
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:08,359
ones that gives me

1034
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,359
G small

1035
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:15,520
ID okay so you see that in

1036
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,000
this

1037
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:21,720
summation I have two contributions one

1038
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,280
is the weighted sum on the mo fractions

1039
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,000
of the pure component chemical

1040
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:29,760
potentials which are equal to the pure

1041
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:32,799
component gives three energies and that

1042
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,440
is this plus

1043
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:38,440
this because in this case binary mixture

1044
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,839
the sum is just limited to two

1045
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,359
components okay and then I have this

1046
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:47,319
this other summation that is here it's

1047
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:48,799
RT times the sum of Y log y That's the

1048
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:52,400
entropy of

1049
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:57,520
mixing isobaric

1050
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,520
mixing okay so that's the G

1051
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,720
and these are the ideal chemical

1052
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,720
potentials and then we recall

1053
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:12,119
that now below here I have listed some

1054
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,119
of the

1055
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:15,119
historical

1056
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,119
um guesses or sort of um

1057
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,119
semiempirical uh theories that have been

1058
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,119
developed

1059
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,119
in order to come

1060
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:36,839
up uh with ways of representing the

1061
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,640
excess part so the the non ideal part of

1062
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:43,280
the behavior of

1063
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:45,720
mixtures the simplest

1064
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,720
one by

1065
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,720
margules see this is 19 18

1066
00:59:52,799 --> 01:00:00,200
1895

1067
00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:00,200
yeah my grand father was 1889

1068
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,440
so he was six years

1069
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,000
old uh

1070
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,000
okay so

1071
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
GX

1072
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:20,240
uh is so it's so it's assumed to be like

1073
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,799
like symmetric a single parameter which

1074
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:26,799
may depend on temperature and

1075
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:30,880
pressure but the dependence composition

1076
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,880
is just the product of the two more

1077
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,559
fractions and if you do

1078
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:42,280
the uh the proper derivatives in order

1079
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:46,079
to to obtain the the the excess chemical

1080
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:49,079
potential that derives from

1081
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,760
that you find that the chemical potent

1082
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:53,920
the excess chemical potential of

1083
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:58,480
component one is equal to that function

1084
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,480
to that let's call it Con Conant

1085
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:06,039
a constant in terms that it doesn't

1086
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:08,039
depend on composition times the square

1087
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:11,720
of the mole fraction of the other

1088
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,720
component and the same

1089
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:23,280
here if you go down below here uh I have

1090
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:26,680
written an expression that um we

1091
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,480
have derived y

1092
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,440
ago that

1093
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:34,480
relates

1094
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:36,960
the uh enthalpy of mixing to the

1095
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,960
chemical

1096
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,480
potential now

1097
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:51,079
actually since for the ideal uh chemical

1098
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,079
potential there is no enthalpy of

1099
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,359
mixing and

1100
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:05,799
okay if I if I take this expression here

1101
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:11,240
and uh uh do this

1102
01:02:05,799 --> 01:02:11,240
derivative I obtain let's

1103
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,440
see uh so that's

1104
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,680
a

1105
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:22,160
[Music]

1106
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,160
Y2 over

1107
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:28,359
t with

1108
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,359
respect to one over

1109
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:33,000
T so

1110
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:42,960
it's so it's a so it's it's equal to the

1111
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,960
chemical potential itself yeah there it

1112
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,520
is because you divide by T div and take

1113
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,000
the derivative with respect to one / T

1114
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,440
that's just the one / T So derivative

1115
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,359
some simply

1116
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:59,319
one okay so

1117
01:02:56,359 --> 01:03:04,000
it means that this so the the chemical

1118
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:07,880
the enthalpy of mixing is a Y2 so in the

1119
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,880
limit when Y2 is equal to

1120
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:17,960
1 it means that the constant a

1121
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,960
represents the the enthalpy of

1122
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:24,039
mixing and remember the

1123
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,720
enthalpy the mixing yeah the enthalpy of

1124
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:30,839
mixing is u

1125
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:35,480
um is the change in in enthalpy when you

1126
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:37,000
add a little bit of of that of substance

1127
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,839
one

1128
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:45,279
into

1129
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:48,599
a a a mixture when in which uh the

1130
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:52,359
predominant component is

1131
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,359
two that's why we

1132
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:57,720
evaluate we evaluate it at uh

1133
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:02,799
um at Y2 Y2 equal

1134
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:08,960
1 but you can also find the same for the

1135
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,839
component one so it turns out that

1136
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:17,039
constant a is also equal to the to the

1137
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:20,079
mixing enthalpy of component two in in

1138
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:23,520
pure so essentially this says that the

1139
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:27,400
marulas one parameter model is able to

1140
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:30,079
modeling only liquid mixtures in which

1141
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:33,240
the effect of adding component one to

1142
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:36,039
Pure two is equal to the effect of

1143
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,920
adding component two to Pure one so in

1144
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:41,200
other words this

1145
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:45,359
mixture uh is very symmetric molecules

1146
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,359
are very uh similar to one

1147
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:52,839
another so he developed a two parameter

1148
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:55,039
model is slightly more complicated but

1149
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:57,640
at least I have two parameters and these

1150
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,039
two parameters turn out to

1151
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:03,400
be related to The Mixing enthalpies of

1152
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,400
the two

1153
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:12,480
components which makes more sense

1154
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:15,760
because uh if I have a bunch of water

1155
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,359
and put some alcohol in it I obtain a

1156
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:23,039
different effect than if I had a bunch

1157
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:23,039
of alcohol and I put some water in it

1158
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,160
and so this is margul two parameters van

1159
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:37,000
lar also is a two parameter some sort of

1160
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,000
an inverse of marus 2

1161
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:43,920
parameter it

1162
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:46,160
also of course

1163
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,160
satisfies the do and

1164
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,160
margus

1165
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:56,559
condition and again these A and B are

1166
01:05:52,520 --> 01:06:01,240
related to the delta when you write it

1167
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,240
this way are related to The Mixing

1168
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:12,720
enthalpies but two

1169
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,039
parameters for many many mixtures are

1170
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,880
not enough

1171
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,000
because molecules may be very different

1172
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:23,440
you may have long molecules small

1173
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,880
molecules you have to account for the

1174
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,359
fact that maybe a long molec is

1175
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:34,359
surrounded by many small molecules and

1176
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:34,359
so you need more parameters for

1177
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:41,680
reality and people over and over have

1178
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,480
developed models with more parameters

1179
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,359
they all satisfy the D margus relation

1180
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,760
for example this

1181
01:06:46,359 --> 01:06:53,880
one was considered by gugenheim and then

1182
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:56,799
became famous under the name of redlick

1183
01:06:53,880 --> 01:07:00,920
ker uh this other

1184
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:06,079
one was developed by Wilson it's not the

1185
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:10,839
same Wilson as the uh Cloud

1186
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:10,839
chamber and based on this

1187
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:19,760
model uh developments and improvements

1188
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,760
of the Wilson model by prits and

1189
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:26,799
co-workers you have uh the models that

1190
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,640
you found you find now in your softwares

1191
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:29,640
that do

1192
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:42,200
modeling which have which have several

1193
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:45,640
uh par parameters which are

1194
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,720
related these epsilons are related to

1195
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:51,799
the Leonard

1196
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:55,839
jnes potential so to to the strength

1197
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:57,079
with which molecule one is attracted Ed

1198
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:00,520
by molecule

1199
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:02,039
one and this is molecule one attracted

1200
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:05,520
by molecules

1201
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:09,440
two and two by

1202
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:12,760
two and so you see there is some uh the

1203
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,920
physics the the physics behind this

1204
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,560
model uh is

1205
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:21,120
still related to the fact that we're

1206
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,600
trying to describe intermolecular forces

1207
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,600
and their

1208
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:29,600
effects and these are the specific

1209
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,600
volume over the pure uh

1210
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,880
components

1211
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:45,120
so in practice you

1212
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,040
describe chemical potentials and

1213
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:53,719
therefore it GS free energy uh of a

1214
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:58,279
mixture in this uh Way by adding up

1215
01:08:53,719 --> 01:09:00,600
contributions so here are some examples

1216
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:03,400
I mean examples of uh how these

1217
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:07,600
contributions look as function for a

1218
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:12,319
binary mixture as function of U uh the

1219
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,319
mole fraction or of component

1220
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:20,319
one for

1221
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,319
example

1222
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:27,359
um just the term y log y

1223
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:32,719
is this pinkish curve

1224
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,359
here if you

1225
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,359
add also this other

1226
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:46,719
term and of course it depends on on what

1227
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,839
assumptions you take for

1228
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:53,199
the for the GI free energies of the pure

1229
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:55,840
component here I assumed zero for

1230
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:59,960
component two and

1231
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:04,000
uh is this number here maybe 0

1232
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:08,400
point five or or or

1233
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,600
six for component one just to make this

1234
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,239
so

1235
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:15,120
this this is the linear part the first

1236
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:17,520
two terms are linear in in the mole

1237
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:21,000
fraction and that's the blue

1238
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:24,320
curve so you add up the blue curve and

1239
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:29,040
the pinkish one and you get the red

1240
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:32,600
curve that is g

1241
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,600
ideal just like

1242
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,719
that and then here I

1243
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,640
plotted the marulas one parameter that's

1244
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:45,400
the

1245
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:51,360
green margul has two parameters the

1246
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:51,360
black and Van the orange

1247
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:04,080
now when you add

1248
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:06,800
up the ideal and the excess gives three

1249
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,600
energy see this is negative this is

1250
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,880
positive they add up and here is what

1251
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,760
you take you you

1252
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:19,199
obtain these are for the three cases

1253
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,520
marulas one parameter two parameters one

1254
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:24,520
lar you obtain shapes that are

1255
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,520
non-trivial

1256
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,400
and

1257
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:34,080
actually in some cases that also they're

1258
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:38,080
also no good in the sense that they

1259
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,080
violate the stability

1260
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,280
conditions

1261
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:52,040
because the second derivative of uh

1262
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:56,120
G must always be

1263
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:59,159
positive we we'll come back to this

1264
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,960
uh in in a short

1265
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:07,520
while um so here we will find that there

1266
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:10,360
is where where the the convexity is uh

1267
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,159
second derivative is negative this will

1268
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:15,280
have unstable

1269
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:17,840
States and uh this will drive us to

1270
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:20,159
exactly the same uh ideas that we have

1271
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:24,280
seen for the Vander valal case for the

1272
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:28,320
pure substance un unstable States and

1273
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,320
also stable states are

1274
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,719
possible but we postpone that for for a

1275
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,520
while when we are in the business of um

1276
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,760
mixtures there are other terms that I

1277
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,440
only want to mention because they are

1278
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:57,760
used in the by the practitioners

1279
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,450
and that might be confusing so I want to

1280
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:03,120
link to what uh we're

1281
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:07,040
[Music]

1282
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:09,280
doing these are called for the

1283
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:13,560
condensed

1284
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:16,040
phases we use activities and activity

1285
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,840
coefficients it's just another way of

1286
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:23,000
writing of of of of of writing the

1287
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:28,120
chemical potential so to

1288
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,120
speak you could Define the activity this

1289
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:34,120
way so you take uh the chemical

1290
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:34,120
potential this

1291
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:41,679
one you

1292
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:45,000
subtract the same at some reference

1293
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:50,600
conditions of pressure and

1294
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:53,440
composition so not necessarily the pure

1295
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:57,040
uh the pure

1296
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,040
substance divided by

1297
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,880
13 that

1298
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,520
means that essentially you rewriting

1299
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:09,520
your chemical potential as a term

1300
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:13,920
evaluated at those reference

1301
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:17,000
conditions plus RT log of the activity

1302
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,560
so that you have an an equation that

1303
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,400
resembles this

1304
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:24,639
one except that here you have the

1305
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,880
activity and here you have taken uh a

1306
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,800
reference

1307
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,880
chemical potential not for the pure

1308
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:35,239
substance but for the mixture at

1309
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:38,920
some uh uh conditions that you decide to

1310
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:38,920
be reference useful as a

1311
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,880
reference and you can also Define the

1312
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,480
activity coefficient which is the ratio

1313
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:50,320
of the activity to the mole

1314
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:55,560
fraction so that here you

1315
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:59,239
have uh the logarithm of Y

1316
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:02,360
which represents the ideal

1317
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:05,239
part of the contribution and the non-

1318
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:09,800
ideal or the

1319
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:12,679
excess is sort of all contained in this

1320
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:16,000
activity

1321
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:18,920
coefficient so that's just changing

1322
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
names defining variables but the

1323
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:25,000
substance of the matter is what we've

1324
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
done

1325
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,600
uh in in the

1326
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:41,679
same way people have uh sometimes used

1327
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:41,679
fasi this is used for for uh the gaseous

1328
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:50,280
phases so Fugi

1329
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:52,199
is um play the

1330
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:55,719
role

1331
01:15:52,199 --> 01:16:00,159
uh of sort of a general

1332
01:15:55,719 --> 01:16:04,560
the partial pressures

1333
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:07,360
but the idea is that

1334
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,800
here you

1335
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,800
you so you

1336
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:17,440
define you see this relations let start

1337
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:20,159
from this relation here uh the chemical

1338
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:23,760
potential you write it again as usual

1339
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:25,960
like we did we do we

1340
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:29,800
did uh

1341
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,800
as we take as reference the pure

1342
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:38,120
substance then you you have rt log of

1343
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:41,960
Y okay and then you have plus RT log of

1344
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:45,920
p over p 0 plus RT log of so essentially

1345
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:50,400
you you you rename uh the

1346
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:55,960
excess chemical potential in terms of

1347
01:16:50,400 --> 01:17:01,400
this uh fugacity uh coefficient

1348
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:04,880
or if you uh want to start from the

1349
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:08,280
chemical potential you define the

1350
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:13,360
fugacity by selecting again a reference

1351
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:17,440
uh uh condition for your mixture not

1352
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:20,679
necessarily like we do here the pure

1353
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,679
substance by

1354
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,960
selecting uh you select this coefficient

1355
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:32,360
this

1356
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:36,159
this this this this prefactor here has

1357
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:41,040
a something that in the limit of ideal

1358
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:43,080
gas behavior reduces to the partial

1359
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,760
pressure so the

1360
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:48,080
fugacity in those limit is the partial

1361
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:52,600
pressure times the exponent of

1362
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:56,840
this okay so again just this is just

1363
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,840
because I wanted to mention it

1364
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,560
for example if you compute the

1365
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:06,159
activities for the marulas van and

1366
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:10,719
marulas 2 parameters here are the

1367
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:14,199
expressions and here are

1368
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:18,159
their for the van L this is I think this

1369
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:18,159
is for the one L

1370
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:26,719
um how the activity depends on mole

1371
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:28,560
fraction and on that parameter that

1372
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,520
characterizes the model or the

1373
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:33,639
parameters A and B that

1374
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,639
characterize the

1375
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,159
model and that

1376
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,840
means that when we talk about liquid

1377
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,360
Vapor

1378
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:51,560
equilibrium for example let's suppose we

1379
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:54,720
use the vanar

1380
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:57,639
model and you remember that we have to

1381
01:18:54,720 --> 01:19:01,080
[Music]

1382
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:05,120
apply uh if we have two substances that

1383
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:07,760
are both volatile and uh

1384
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:12,880
condensable we have to apply twice the

1385
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,920
routes law now routs law rites for for a

1386
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,639
for

1387
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:20,400
a an non ideal

1388
01:19:16,639 --> 01:19:22,840
mixture where you substitute the mole

1389
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:25,320
fraction with the activity the mole

1390
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,400
fraction of the for for the components

1391
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,920
in the liquid with their activities and

1392
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,120
we've given the expressions for the

1393
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,520
activities in the previous slide also

1394
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:38,159
for the vanar so if

1395
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:40,719
you if you do that

1396
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:43,440
substitution here is what uh the

1397
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:48,000
equations of the

1398
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:51,000
um Bubble line is and this is for the DU

1399
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
line

1400
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,560
they used to be uh one of them used to

1401
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:04,239
be a straight

1402
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:06,639
line but with this uh non ideal

1403
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:09,920
model uh it

1404
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,920
becomes very

1405
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:18,480
different and the DU line also becomes

1406
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,480
sort of

1407
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:27,159
interesting so just two parameters

1408
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:29,880
introdu use a lot of structure and the

1409
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:32,920
behavior of your

1410
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:37,960
mixture including the possibility of

1411
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,960
this which is um called the

1412
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:48,440
aotop the aotop is a a condition in

1413
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:54,040
which you go from

1414
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:54,040
liquid to uh vapor

1415
01:20:55,960 --> 01:21:01,199
uh and that change is not across a

1416
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:04,400
finite temperature

1417
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:09,960
difference but at a single temperature

1418
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:13,280
so it behaves as if it were a pure

1419
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,880
substance like few substance boils and

1420
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:19,320
condenses at the same unique

1421
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,480
temperature but this occurs only at that

1422
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:24,000
particular composition at other

1423
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:26,639
compositions instead you have a range of

1424
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,159
temperatures so the temperatures the

1425
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,159
temperature of the

1426
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:38,400
U liquidus is is

1427
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:39,480
is is different than than of the uh of

1428
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,480
the

1429
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,480
vaporus

1430
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:51,679
okay uh this is

1431
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:54,560
done by combining these two you can

1432
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:57,040
construct a plot at a constant temp

1433
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:03,159
temperature but you can also the same

1434
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:03,159
equations construct the plot at constant

1435
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:11,360
pressure

1436
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:13,679
okay and of course you can eliminate the

1437
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,239
pressure between the two and

1438
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:18,800
construct for a given temperature or for

1439
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:21,440
a given pressure the relation that you

1440
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,560
have between the composition of the

1441
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,520
vapor phase and the composition of the

1442
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,520
liquid phase

1443
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:35,760
so these are all things that you can

1444
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:40,960
Implement in an Excel file and so on and

1445
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,960
very easy if you have few

1446
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:54,560
parameters uh there is

1447
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:58,440
also a Lenard John model

1448
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,440
of the mixture of the binary

1449
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:03,280
mixture so

1450
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:10,960
here this model is

1451
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:13,760
taken again this article on Wikipedia

1452
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:15,719
from which I take these plots very

1453
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:20,600
nicely uh

1454
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:20,600
done it explains that you can

1455
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:28,120
assume for the sigma you remember that

1456
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:31,719
the model of in the Leonard mod model

1457
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:35,560
lard Jones model Sigma is a

1458
01:23:31,719 --> 01:23:38,840
representation of the

1459
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,719
the the diameter essentially of the two

1460
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,679
of the

1461
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:47,760
particle so when they Collide the two

1462
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:51,840
centers of the two spheres are at a

1463
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,840
distance which is equal to the their

1464
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:58,000
diameter if you have uh spheres of

1465
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:00,719
different

1466
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,760
sizes the

1467
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:06,639
diameter at which they Collide is sort

1468
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:09,520
of the the sum of the

1469
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:12,639
radi so the radi is a half of the

1470
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,280
diameter so the sum of the halfs is just

1471
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:17,800
the

1472
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:20,120
average diameter of the of the two

1473
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,120
proper

1474
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:27,159
diameters so you assume

1475
01:24:25,239 --> 01:24:29,320
a ler John's

1476
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:32,360
curve uh or

1477
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:35,520
potential characterized by a sigma one2

1478
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:37,719
for the for the uh interaction between

1479
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,960
two unlike

1480
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:42,639
particles that is equal to this

1481
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:47,520
mean

1482
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:50,679
value and then for the depth of the

1483
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,679
Leonard John's

1484
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:58,040
valy you use um

1485
01:24:55,320 --> 01:25:03,159
the geometric

1486
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:06,600
mean of the S of the pure component

1487
01:25:03,159 --> 01:25:09,159
ones but then you also use an adjustable

1488
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,159
parameter

1489
01:25:14,119 --> 01:25:21,679
C now the

1490
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:25,480
geometric if assume if if C is equal to

1491
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:29,920
one this geometric uh uh

1492
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:32,960
mean uh gives you the equivalent of the

1493
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,520
ideal uh solution

1494
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:40,119
model and in fact you

1495
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:42,440
get that the bubble line is straight is

1496
01:25:40,119 --> 01:25:48,159
a straight

1497
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:48,159
line and this is with C is equal to

1498
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:58,760
one uh if you change instead

1499
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,880
C to like greater than

1500
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:05,320
one you

1501
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:08,679
get real a non ideal mixture Behavior

1502
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:13,199
with an aotop at this

1503
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:16,960
composition if you change C from 1.2

1504
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:20,800
to 85 it goes on the other side so it's

1505
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:23,800
an isotrope uh upper isotrope lower

1506
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,800
isotrope

1507
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,679
and

1508
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:36,400
also if

1509
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:38,880
you play with the ratio this is wrong

1510
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:44,080
this should be a Epsilon 2 over Epsilon

1511
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:49,920
one of course I need to correct that so

1512
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:54,840
if you change that from this one to very

1513
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:59,159
different you may find a

1514
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:04,080
critical region in other words that you

1515
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:10,199
could allow you to go from

1516
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:14,560
liquid to Vapor without a phase change

1517
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:17,199
similarly to what happens in a pure

1518
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,040
substance or if you have if you go above

1519
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:22,920
the

1520
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:27,280
critical uh point you can you can take a

1521
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,280
liquid to very and vice

1522
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,800
versa

1523
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:44,199
so this case is

1524
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:47,199
one see for example

1525
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:47,199
here

1526
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:55,239
um in which you have a

1527
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:57,360
um well if you were in liquid liquid

1528
01:27:55,239 --> 01:28:00,560
this would give you partial visibility

1529
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:03,560
but we'll do that in another in

1530
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,560
another

1531
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,840
occasion

1532
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:14,840
okay so now let's talk about a bit of

1533
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,840
the uh stability

1534
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:29,400
conditions so I as you uh as we have

1535
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:31,760
seen we can go see the business here is

1536
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:34,360
to go from the properties of a pure

1537
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,000
substance to the properties of the other

1538
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:39,600
substance and all the way to all the

1539
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:45,560
compositions in

1540
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:45,560
between and when we uh when we do these

1541
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:51,119
uh diagrams

1542
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:54,520
here everything is

1543
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:59,080
fixed by the condition this is a binary

1544
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:01,719
composition so is fixed by the fact

1545
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:04,719
that

1546
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:04,719
mu1

1547
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:15,320
F uh must be at

1548
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,320
TP y let's say one

1549
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:23,040
YF so for component one in the phase

1550
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,320
F I have to have the same chemical

1551
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,920
potential of the of that component in

1552
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,920
the phase

1553
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:34,760
G

1554
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:38,560
okay and that's one condition of of

1555
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:40,719
chemical of um Mutual stable equilibrium

1556
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,719
the

1557
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,520
other uh

1558
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:52,239
m2f um

1559
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:06,000
yeah well let's let's call it again one

1560
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:08,360
one F in the let's choose the for

1561
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,719
variables the mole fraction of one of

1562
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:12,199
them

1563
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:14,800
otherwise but I need to impose the

1564
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:16,960
condition for uh equality of the

1565
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,920
chemical potential also of the other

1566
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:24,040
component so mu2 must be equal to

1567
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,880
mu2 okay so I have a system of two

1568
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:28,840
equations

1569
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:31,960
here and that system of two

1570
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:35,239
equations can be

1571
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,239
solved in

1572
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,520
general to give

1573
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:50,119
me

1574
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,719
this to give me the comp for a given

1575
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,880
temperature and pressure I can solve

1576
01:30:55,719 --> 01:30:59,800
this system for the unknowns that are

1577
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,920
the mole

1578
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:06,320
fractions of component one in the gasius

1579
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,320
and in the vapor

1580
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:20,239
phase so here I have pressure and

1581
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:23,239
temperature I fixed the pressure and the

1582
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:24,679
temperature and then that system of

1583
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:27,560
equation

1584
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:29,360
gives me the mole fraction of the liquid

1585
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:33,280
and the mole fraction of the vapor so I

1586
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:35,600
have this surface so that equation here

1587
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:38,760
gives me is an equation

1588
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,560
of of this surface here actually this is

1589
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,159
on the liquid and on the vapor so it's

1590
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,080
on the other side but you can do it for

1591
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:48,280
all the

1592
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:50,360
phases and you have these gaps here

1593
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,280
these empty spaces between these

1594
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:57,560
surfaces which doesn't represent any uh

1595
01:31:54,280 --> 01:32:01,199
um State because any stable State

1596
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:04,760
because if you are there this system

1597
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:08,440
likes to find stable equilibrium by

1598
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:13,400
separating and generating the two uh

1599
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:13,400
phases so that's uh the

1600
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,639
idea and uh yeah I think we we stop here

1601
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:27,679
because there's not enough time to do

1602
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:31,159
hry law uh but we can um yeah we so next

1603
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:33,520
time we will finish up this part and we

1604
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:36,520
start the systems with chemical

1605
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,520
reactions
