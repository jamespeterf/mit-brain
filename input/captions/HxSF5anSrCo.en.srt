1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Our

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,360
next speaker is uh Kevin Bradshaw. He is

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,400
senior vice pres president of data

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,720
center strategy at FM which is an

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,279
insurance company that is an ILP member

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,080
and I work with FM actually had the

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,480
original idea to put on a workshop

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
dealing with data centers because it's a

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,439
obviously with Kevin it's someplace they

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
focus on and uh it was supposed to be

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
one company and then it turned into a

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
much bigger thing. So thank you Kevin

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
for giving me something to do all

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,880
summer.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
>> No problem.

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,480
>> So let's hear it for Kevin Brad.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,480
>> Yeah. Thanks.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,960
So, I'm uh Kevin Bradshaw. Um and I work

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,760
for FM. And a lot of people probably

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
wondering who's FM? What's FM? So, FM is

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,879
a commercial property insurance company.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
Uh we we don't insure cars. We don't

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,239
insure liability or personal. It's only

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,400
commercial property. Primarily focused

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,680
on the bigger industries. Uh we ensure a

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,600
lot of uh paper companies and and power

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,320
generation companies, tons of

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,680
manufacturing companies, uh lots of

29
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,080
mining, lots of real estate, and yes, we

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,640
do insure MIT. That's one of our clients

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,119
also. So we just ensure the the

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
commercial property and uh we provide

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,240
services for it, which I'll get into in

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
just a minute.

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,960
Um,

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
so you're probably sitting here

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
wondering, well, before I go there, I

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,799
just tell you on from a market size,

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
we're a little over10 billion a year in

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,880
annual premium

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,960
and we have um the u about 40% share of

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
the US market. We're the largest in the

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,479
in in the US and uh and then worldwide.

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,920
We're also extremely large uh company

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,479
for commercial property insurance.

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,560
So, you might be wondering, well, why

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,439
what in the wide world of sports is an

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
insurance guy after that as that

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,560
presentation? What's what is an

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,799
insurance guy doing up here talking

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
about data centers? Well, I got some

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,560
good news. I'm towards the end of the

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,720
agenda and the day is almost over

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
and I'm going to even better news is I'm

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,800
going to do this in 15 minutes. I've

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
already taken a couple. All right. So,

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm going to leave you with three

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
impressions related to insurance of

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520
these physical assets that are being

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
built out there.

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,239
And um I mean, you've probably been

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
reading the press. I mean, I just the

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
last one I just saw as they're

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
estimating by the end of the decade over

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,239
7 trillion dollar of investment into

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
building out of data centers around the

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,239
globe.

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
So, there's a ton of money pouring in.

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,920
There's a lot of l new construction

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
going on and these things are getting

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,319
bigger and bigger and bigger.

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
So the first impression I I want to give

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,519
you from an insurance, a property

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,800
insurance

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
is you can have losses, you can have

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,599
fires,

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,000
you can have equipment breakdowns,

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,440
um, and you can have big storms come

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
through, you can have earthquakes,

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,640
wildfire, and all this. And guess where

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,360
they're building a lot of data centers

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,159
in a lot of those areas. Okay? So they

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,720
obviously they need insurance.

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,080
So when it comes to losses um if you

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,760
only go back because this is a really

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,159
young industry to be relatively okay you

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,319
go back you know last 20 25 years and we

88
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,799
have about 50 clients right now 50 data

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,400
center companies um and we have uh um

90
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,879
you know several thousand locations that

91
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,120
we insure. Um, but they're not that old

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
and it's the good news is they've

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
they've built them to modern

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,480
construction techniques, modern and

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,480
they've got really nice clean

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,400
facilities. Um, they put good fire

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
protection in. They put gaseous systems

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
underneath the subfloors. They put all

99
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,280
kinds of protection in. So, they know

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,760
what they're doing when they build these

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,000
facilities, which has led to pretty

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
benign loss history. Haven't seen a lot

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,720
of losses. Not a lot of really not a lot

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,720
of big fires, a lot of big equipment

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,120
breakdowns. You're not seeing that. And

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,519
you know, we haven't seen a lot of

107
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,120
NATCAT, you know, the wildfires and

108
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,799
winds, none. They haven't really taken

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
out much data center. So, the loss

110
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,639
history

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
is uh is pretty good in this industry.

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,600
And it's because I think that these

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
things are built pretty resilient to

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,800
begin with.

115
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,680
But there's always a butt.

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,960
But we did have a big loss this year. We

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,440
had some um lithium ion batteries and a

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,400
an exterior battery banks or whatever

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,560
caught on fire and the loss is well over

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,759
hund00 million.

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,600
So these big fires can happen. So if you

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,520
start marrying up how many new data

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,520
centers are being built, where they're

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,880
building them, even though we've got

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,840
good not much frequency in loss, and

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
we've finally had a severe loss, what do

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,479
you think insurance companies are

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
predicting for the future when it comes

129
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,840
to losses?

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
Then we're going to be paying clients a

131
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,680
lot of money if we start having losses

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
in this industry.

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,120
So, I want to leave you on that

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
impression is is right now, keep

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
building them safe. Keep building with

136
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,479
all the protection, good construction,

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,199
be mindful of where that where you're

138
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,600
putting it, and you can get away pretty

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,280
good without having huge huge insurance

140
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,160
premiums, and you can have your your

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,479
property insured.

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Which brings us to the next impression I

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,320
want to leave with you.

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,000
And that is the in my 39 plus year

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,240
career,

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,800
the the biggest challenge I've seen the

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,400
insurance industry ever have is going on

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,720
right now. And that's the ability to put

149
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
enough capacity

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
on a program to be able to actually

151
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,160
ensure the exposed risk for these

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
companies that are owning and operating

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,120
these equipments.

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,639
I'll tell you a little story.

155
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,080
6 months ago when I was working on this

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,800
strategy and um a typical company like

157
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,120
ours will put on a on a contract policy

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
will have a billion dollars of capacity.

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
Your limit of liability for the policy

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,600
for a fire, an explosion, billion

161
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,479
dollars pretty much covers any single

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,160
location having a bad loss. You know,

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,280
you got enough insurance to cover the

164
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,199
whole loss. Okay? You're not left bare

165
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,720
when the insurance company finishes

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,319
paying.

167
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
So, a billion dollars, maybe a billion

168
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,960
and a half. Some companies maybe a

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
little bit more than that, up to$2

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,199
billion. That was pretty much the

171
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,000
industry standard.

172
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,560
And then two months ago, I was giving an

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,759
update to our executives

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
and one of the things they wanted me to

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,120
do is what are some of the biggest

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,759
challenges you're having as you stare

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
into the future for ensuring these data

178
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,639
centers and all this construction going

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
on?

180
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,919
And I put on the board, I said, 'Well,

181
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,000
we're starting to get requests for 5

182
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,479
billion in in capacity.

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,039
And um

184
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,960
that is hard to put together right now.

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,639
Near impossible.

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
You can't get enough insurance companies

187
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
and reinsurance companies who are

188
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
reinsuring the insurance companies. You

189
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,240
can't get enough capacity built in the

190
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,039
entire insurance market to be able to

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,800
put $5 billion of limited liability on a

192
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:28,479
policy. Okay.

193
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Now, two weeks on or well two months on

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:36,479
today, we're getting requests for 10,

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:39,360
15, and $25 billion in capacity.

196
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,360
And folks, it's not out there. There's

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
no way you can put it together. So, the

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,319
CEOs of all the insurance companies and

199
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,520
the reinsurance companies and the

200
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
private equity uh groups and the brokers

201
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,280
are all getting together trying to

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,120
figure out what kind of solution

203
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
without god forbid asking the government

204
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,759
to pitch in would you have if you had

205
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,520
really catastrophic losses.

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,400
Now, the reason you want this capacity

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
I'll give you an example of a location

208
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,680
million square feet. Now, that's a big

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,639
building, right? one story big million

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,240
square feet that's a big building you

211
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:20,319
can shove about 300 to 400,000 GPUs and

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,479
about 10 12 15 20 halls into a million

213
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
square foot building

214
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
but think about it it's one building one

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
exposure

216
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
if you had a fire run away and ran out

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
of water you could spread it from hall

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,800
to hall to hall you could actually do

219
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,320
that and that's how insurance companies

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,320
view the maximum foreseeable loss

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,320
so this particular facility has about

222
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,519
$20 billion worth of value in just the

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,880
GPUs. Not counting the building, not

224
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,399
counting the infrastructure, the

225
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,240
cooling, not counting the the the the

226
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,120
gas turbine sitting outside, none of

227
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,880
that. So the overall site is 30 $40

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
billion

229
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
and that's a million square feet.

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
But if you've seen some of these other

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,560
projects like Fermy south of Amarillo,

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,320
they're going to invest $250 billion

233
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,519
into a single campus full of this stuff.

234
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,200
So the biggest challenge in the

235
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,720
insurance industry is coming up with a

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
solution.

237
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,760
Okay? And I and I don't I don't know

238
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,360
what it's going to be, but so so what do

239
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,640
you do about it? Well,

240
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
you know, the big companies, the big

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,839
alphabetic companies and the and the

242
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
developers and the architects and all

243
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
them, they need to start, you know,

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
thinking about how do you

245
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,279
compartmentalize a campus?

246
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
How do you build more buildings? And I

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,000
know nobody wants to hear we got to

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
build more buildings. We'd rather just

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,920
put it in a big building because that's

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
more expensive.

251
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,320
But what are you going to do if you

252
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
can't insure it and you have no

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,480
insurance? You're bare.

254
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
What happens is whoever's loaning you

255
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,399
the money to do it isn't going to give

256
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
you the loan.

257
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,360
So that's the dilemma that we're facing.

258
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,640
So insurance capacity is the impression.

259
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
Someone was telling me just a little

260
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,279
earlier that the limiting factor on data

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,680
centers is power. It might be insurance

262
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,600
before long.

263
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,279
>> And lastly, I think it's it's is to

264
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
build these facilities very very

265
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
resilient. I already said that they

266
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,480
build them pretty good now. They're

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,079
pretty well put together. They're clean.

268
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,760
They put protection. They don't fuss

269
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,000
about getting protection in there. Um,

270
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,399
but you got to but the the the industry

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,160
is evolving. And I'm sure all day long

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,920
you heard about what's coming next. What

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,880
what's what's the next thing in cooling?

274
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,240
What's the next thing in Well, every

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,200
time you introduce something new like

276
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,680
that, you're creating a new exposure

277
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,279
that our research people, we have a

278
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,040
couple reps from our research people.

279
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,519
What we do as our research group of

280
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,240
about over a hundred research scientists

281
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,800
is we look for loss prevention and we do

282
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,040
research to figure out what kind of

283
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,640
protection or what kind of construction

284
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,839
materials or what kind of things you

285
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,320
could do to make it resilience to loss

286
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,120
whether it's fire loss equipment

287
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,640
breakdown loss wind loss on the roof

288
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,360
whatever. So we're we got a lot of

289
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,800
research going on. Matter of fact, these

290
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,880
guys have 21 over 20 research projects

291
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,040
specifically for things that are going

292
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,680
into data centers right now that we're

293
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
working on. Now, how does that get to

294
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,360
you? Pretty simple. Once we do the

295
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,440
research, we give it to our engineering,

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
which is represented here, and they

297
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,399
develop guidelines and data sheets and

298
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
standards on how best to protect it,

299
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,760
which materials not to use, which

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,360
materials to use, and then how to

301
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
protect it.

302
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,399
And if you go on uh correct me if I'm

303
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,839
wrong, but if you go on fm.com,

304
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,680
those data sheets are available to

305
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
everybody. We don't keep those

306
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,800
confidential. We share them with the

307
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,000
world. We got data sheets on um data

308
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,519
centers, on turbine generators, gas

309
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,920
turbines, roof systems,

310
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,440
fire protection, gashes, fire protection

311
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,480
systems,

312
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,560
um gas detection, you know, those

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
things. So we got full of data sheets.

314
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,079
But with what's changing in this

315
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
industry so fast, we have to have the

316
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,000
research because we got to keep evolving

317
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,079
the protection guidelines for that.

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,079
Once we have the standards and we put

319
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,839
together our procedures, we have a over

320
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
a thousand engineers who go out in the

321
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,800
field and help clients uh understand the

322
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,959
hazards they have uh give them

323
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
recommendations, challenge them. And we

324
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,079
got a lot of people now starting to work

325
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,320
on construction projects trying to get

326
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,639
in early to make sure the developers and

327
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
the designers and the builders are

328
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,079
putting in the right protection, using

329
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,519
the right materials, using the right

330
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,760
equipment to make sure it's well

331
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,120
protected.

332
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
So with that, I got those three

333
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
impressions.

334
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,480
Losses aren't happening. Haven't been

335
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,639
happening, but they're going to happen.

336
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,040
Second impression is we're running out

337
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,839
of insurance capacity. And the third one

338
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,560
is build it right. Build build it

339
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,560
resilient to loss.
