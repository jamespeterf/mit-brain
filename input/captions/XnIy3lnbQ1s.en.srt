1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,600
okay uh thanks for that great

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:07,839
introduction uh actually Yugi's talk was

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:12,240
a great uh uh introduction also for what

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,719
I want to talk about uh so traditionally

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,560
uh CO2 uh is first uh captured into a

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,880
pallet reactor into calcium carbonate

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,439
and then uh into high Purity CO2 when

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,199
when we c on it and then it's passed to

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,400
this gashes electrolyzer into Co or

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,160
other products C2 products so what I'm

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,840
going to tell you today is a way to

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,320
convert uh liquid to liquid so is

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,840
captured as a bicarbonate uh hc3 1 minus

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,719
and then uh is turned into this uh

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,719
highly concentrated alkaline metal uh

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,120
for example potassium um formate uh

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,000
liquid and uh as Yuki mentioned uh there

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,920
is this problem of carbon efficiency of

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,079
the current room temperature

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,000
electrolyzers and and and one big

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,559
problem is with the crossover from the

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,439
castled uh so a lot of the an exchange

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,439
membranes uh couldn't stop the carbonate

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,880
from car uh from cross over because

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,080
carbonate 2 minus is an anine and uh the

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,240
other issue is is actually

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,520
thermodynamics how do you maintain

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,479
steady state pH as you're operating this

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,119
electrolyzer so uh what we try to show

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,520
is that is indeed possible by uh

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,119
engineering the uh partial pressure of

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,880
CO2 uh and by selecting the membrane to

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,320
achieve a stat State operation and get a

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,240
very high carbon deficiency uh from this

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,720
CO2 capture uh potassium bicarbonate

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,840
liquid to uh potassium formate liquid

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,759
and uh uh as you see here uh when you

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,560
have uh this uh carbon capture uh Fe

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,240
stock uh some of it uh after the

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,039
electrolyzer most of it is actually

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,439
unreacted and some of it even cross over

42
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,560
to the anod side and so you re really

43
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,799
waste a lot of the carbon uh just

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,520
captured because of the inefficiency and

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,039
because of the design of the

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,440
electrolyzer uh what we have done is to

47
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,400
use a near neutral uh pH instead of

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,200
alkaline uh pH and use a Katon exchange

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,519
membrane instead of a bipolar membrane

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,800
or a uh Anon exchange membrane and it's

51
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,440
very important uh to maintain uh this pH

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,319
balance uh in steady state operation as

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,080
Yuki mentioned if you're actually uh

54
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,319
consuming the uh hydroxy in the in the

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,920
solution then that's actually not a uh a

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:44,280
steady state operation so by uh uh

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,640
engineering the uh overhead space so one

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,760
thing is you have to make sure uh the

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,920
partial pressure of CO2 uh is not uh the

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,959
air condition but it's a 1 atm then uh

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,440
you have a lot more of this pink stuff

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,640
which is the monovalent hc31 minus

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,360
instead of co32 minus and that's

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,599
actually key for uh maintaining this pH

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,400
balance so uh we demonstrate uh in uh

66
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,680
dilute uh potassium uh bicarbonate Fe

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,840
stock uh initially we show that uh when

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,200
we uh operate the castle light in an an

69
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,920
open air uh in free circulation then the

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,319
uh formate yield is very low 6% meaning

71
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,799
that uh you know for all the uh

72
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,720
potassium uh bicarbonate we only have 6%

73
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,280
conversion into form M that's not good

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,560
but uh when we have a sealed bottle uh

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,480
to maintain a a a high uh partial

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,640
pressure of CO2 overhead then uh we can

77
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,400
enhance that to 94% and the proof of the

78
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,239
uh uh formate product is both in the uh

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,519
MMR as well as uh in the uh xrd after

80
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,920
crystallization and then we increase it

81
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:06,720
to 1 M of potassium bicarb bate uh and

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,760
we get an yield of 96 97% for potassium

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
bicarbonate and for sodium bicarbonate

84
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,480
is

85
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:18,359
93% uh the fire efficiency uh is uh

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,479
still uh not very high uh is only uh 30%

87
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,639
but that's uh greatly improved by uh

88
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,240
putting in a 3M uh feast stock so this

89
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,360
is very concentrated uh potassium

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,280
bicarbonate and we get uh very very high

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,400
conversion version so we get eventually

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,080
the formate weight percent is uh 16

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,240
weight per of the liquid so uh it's

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:45,039
nearly 100% conversion uh and we get so

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:48,039
much uh uh potassium formate uh that

96
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,479
that we can uh just uh uh evaporate the

97
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,600
the water and we can get a solid uh

98
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,880
potassium formate Fuel and we can repeat

99
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,120
uh this for 100 hours over you know we

100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,919
can exhaust the Fe stock through this

101
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,919
complete version for four Cycles in this

102
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,360
kind of uh lab scale

103
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,240
electrolyzer now once you have uh the

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,919
potassium uh formate uh you can put it

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,080
in uh this uh uh direct formate Fu cell

106
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,560
so this is not our uh pattern this was

107
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:25,080
uh uh 13 years ago that people show just

108
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,360
by throwing this pum formate into the uh

109
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,000
this alkaline solution you can uh get a

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,800
a decent uh power out put so if we

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,680
compare with uh the standard which is

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,319
hydrogen Fu cell uh now uh there is uh

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
methano economy ammonia economy but both

114
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,840
methano and economy uh uh both meth and

115
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,759
ammonia are kind of toxic uh methano

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,280
also have a poisoning problem so in

117
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,639
direct meal Fu cell you really uh get a

118
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,800
very low power uh output uh in contrast

119
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,800
in the direct formate F cell uh you are

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,919
not as good as the hydrogen but uh it's

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,319
quite a bit better than a mthal direct

122
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,680
methal Fu

123
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:13,319
cell and uh good thing about uh this uh

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:19,240
uh formate uh uh Alkali metal formate uh

125
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:21,759
salt is uh it's really uh uh safe so I

126
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,840
want to draw analogy to water

127
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,280
electrolyzer and hydrogen fuel cell so

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,360
we know that uh in the uh water

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
electrolyzer you supply electricity you

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,759
get

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,759
uh hydrogen gas on one electrode and

132
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,400
oxygen gas on the other electrode in the

133
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,120
fu cell we recombine them and we get

134
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,960
electricity out now on a per molecule

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:48,720
basis uh you get uh about uh 5.9

136
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:52,360
electron volt per reaction uh now if you

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,319
look at this uh uh between the uh carbon

138
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,319
capture product potassium uh uh

139
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,919
bicarbonate uh so this is like the water

140
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:06,120
uh with the uh reduced fuel which is the

141
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,160
potassium formate then all is left I

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,400
mean all that's different is O2 so it's

143
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,199
complete analogous uh this is like water

144
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,560
and this is like hydrogen on a per moo

145
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,680
basis this is actually more energetic is

146
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,919
6.9 electron volt per per reaction now

147
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,800
of course uh there's a lot of baggage

148
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,520
right so there is a potassium cation and

149
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,400
there is also a uh CO2 in there so it's

150
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,280
on a per weight basis is much less

151
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,560
energy efficient than

152
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,319
hydrogen uh but the benefit is uh it's

153
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,680
really uh safe and stable so there are

154
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,039
actually people who have look at molten

155
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,919
uh uh formate salt uh and they find that

156
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,879
it does not corrode carbon steel uh uh

157
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,319
you know even in molten form for 2,000

158
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,879
hours and in fact you have these uh

159
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,199
formate salts for example this sodium

160
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,639
copper formate in organic salt in a lot

161
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,919
of the Heritage objects and you can

162
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,639
pretty much kind of uh digest this uh uh

163
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:10,599
Sal and you wouldn't have a problem this

164
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:14,919
is sort of the uh MSDS uh safety uh

165
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:18,440
sheet uh it's actually used as a uh

166
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,599
deicing salt uh potassium uh or sodium

167
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,520
formate is it's uh very safe

168
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:27,440
nonflammable

169
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:30,240
non-toxic uh and so uh uh again uh on a

170
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,560
per molecule basis it's uh it's is quite

171
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,279
uh quite good now what about uh you know

172
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,680
uh in an engineering setting uh so we

173
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,719
are comparing uh always with the

174
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,760
hydrogen now uh hydrogen gravimetrically

175
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,640
is of course very good but it has to

176
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,600
have a big uh auxiliary component so

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,160
this is a Toyota Mirai uh hydrogen uh uh

178
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,040
tank and to store five kilogram of

179
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,680
hydrogen uh you need uh uh this uh uh uh

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,519
90 kilogram of carbon fiber polymer

181
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,600
composite to store it at 700 atmosphere

182
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,200
so compared to this tank uh this uh salt

183
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,440
you know you can just dig a tank in your

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,600
backyard dump it inside uh it's uh about

185
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,000
onethird gravimetric energy density as

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,320
this tank uh and about 70% volumetric

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,800
energy density as this tank so uh uh we

188
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,399
think this is uh pretty pretty

189
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,360
advantageous and uh the other question

190
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,040
we have is you know uh where do you get

191
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,720
so much uh uh sodium hydroxide or

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,600
potassium hydroxide uh now traditionally

193
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,079
you get this from the Chlor alkal

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,399
electrolyzer process but in that process

195
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,160
you also get chlorine gas so if you

196
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,839
imagining you know uh kiloton sorry

197
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,279
gigaton scale to replace all the fossil

198
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:58,040
fuel uh economy we need a lot of

199
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:02,160
potassium or or sodium uh hydroxide and

200
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,920
so one idea is to uh mine the alkaline

201
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Bal rocks so there are a lot of these

202
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,360
kind of volcanic rocks with excess

203
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,680
potassium oxide or pottassium hydroxide

204
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,320
so you don't take it from uh let's say

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,200
sodium carbonate because to do that you

206
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,160
have to release CO2 back to the

207
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,120
atmosphere so we look for rock which

208
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:23,880
have this excess of alkalinity uh inside

209
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,959
and you also have this kind of advanced

210
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,720
weathering schemes where you have also

211
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,880
this

212
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,360
insoluble alkaline uh oxy side so the

213
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,800
idea is to pump CO2 inside and the uh

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,680
soluble part you pump out to drive this

215
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,399
uh formate economy but then the uh

216
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,519
insoluble part you just leave it as a

217
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,079
permanent uh

218
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,720
sequestration uh now we also now

219
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,200
developing Catalyst uh for this both the

220
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,760
fuel cell and as well as for the

221
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,320
electrolyzer because right now uh the

222
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,200
round the trip Energy Efficiency is

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,160
still pretty poor is around only uh less

224
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,680
than 30% so uh what we're trying to do

225
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,120
here is to use AI to look for

226
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,720
multicomponent catalyst so here we have

227
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,000
this precursor where and we do the high

228
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,959
temperature treatment to get this High

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,600
entropy Catalyst and then we do this

230
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,240
automated uh three electrode kind of uh

231
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,000
catalysis

232
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,440
search uh we are also using this method

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,160
for uh battery electrolytes as well and

234
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,600
what you see here is actually a

235
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,800
semi-automatic where there's still a

236
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,480
human after we have this uh

237
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,000
multicomponent liquid electroly still

238
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,519
drop it on a Co cell for electrochemical

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,320
testing we're also doing quite a bit of

240
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,920
generative Avi looking at literature to

241
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,920
come up with uh better uh formulations

242
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,720
uh so combining experimental data with

243
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,240
computational

244
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,720
data and uh in this space uh we have

245
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,600
actually encountered quite a bit of

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,000
challenges uh so juren who was the

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,560
student who put together this workflow

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
found that there's still a lot of

249
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,519
irreproducibility even though we use

250
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,600
automation uh in the in the system

251
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,320
because there's still uh actually I'm

252
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,279
going to show I mean if I have time I'm

253
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,360
going to show you why there's still a

254
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,560
lot of uh uncontrollable factors uh even

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,959
though it's fully automated so there is

256
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,480
also issues with reconfigurability so

257
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,440
the current robotic workflows are pretty

258
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,320
rigid and pretty subcritical in size so

259
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,959
different automated Labs need to connect

260
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,959
with each other and you need to

261
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,440
interoperate and exchange data and

262
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:31,519
samples and so forth uh but after after

263
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,680
about two years I eventually we're able

264
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,199
to sort of look at catalysts which have

265
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,199
multiple elements and if you look at you

266
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:42,079
know human uh cataly search usually

267
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:44,760
people stop at four to five metallic

268
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,680
elements uh because human mind kind of

269
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,120
get confused uh Beyond uh you know four

270
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,040
or five Dimensions but the computers

271
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,360
with active learning have have none of

272
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,440
those so we're able to do uh this eight

273
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,360
dimensional search and this actually uh

274
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,120
received a uh best student award in this

275
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,480
Europe's

276
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,720
conference and uh the last slide is also

277
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,560
in terms of modeling uh recently we're

278
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,880
able to come up with so-call universal

279
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,160
potential that allows us to study tens

280
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,360
of thousand atoms so much more

281
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,519
computation efficient than traditional

282
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,000
quantum mechanical calculations but yet

283
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,440
at uh density functional Theory kind of

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,240
accuracy and able to simulate the whole

285
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,120
periodic table so uh on computational

286
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,240
front we also have uh this uh deep

287
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,920
learning driven uh fundamental modeling

288
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,720
approach that can combine with the high

289
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,920
throughput uh Catal search and then

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
hopefully that is integrated with Device

291
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,199
level and and sort of drive this kind of

292
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,160
format economy so the final sort of uh

293
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,279
uh slide is just to show that this is

294
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,360
analogous so we try to achieve a steady

295
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,560
state pH electrolyzer that does this

296
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
inorganic uh kind of you can think of

297
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,560
this as as water and this is the

298
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
hydrogen gas but there is an

299
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,519
electrolyzer and F cell so I think we're

300
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,720
able to show this can be a closer cycle

301
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,860
so with that I'd like to thank you and

302
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,960
welcome any

303
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,960
[Applause]

304
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,600
questions have questions on on pigeon

305
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,320
hole questions from the

306
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,320
audience please raise your

307
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,040
hands any questions any comments

308
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,959
oh if there are no questions then okay

309
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,959
we have a

310
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,279
question thank you and it's a very

311
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,440
similar question to the one I had before

312
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,480
this is an absolutely fascinating you've

313
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,079
proposed potentially there's this

314
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,839
alternative and you have some

315
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,639
some data to to support that what will

316
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,519
it take to bring that to an industrial

317
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,000
kind of scale and is it really a

318
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,120
technical barrier or is it more of a

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,399
politics and Regulatory barrier at that

320
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,040
point so right now it's still uh

321
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,399
relatively low TRL so what we have is we

322
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,639
have a few centimeter by few centimeter

323
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,560
electrolyzer and uh we need to increase

324
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,480
the temperature and also the overhead

325
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,440
pressure to uh uh increase the current

326
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,440
density right now is 0.1 ampere per

327
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,759
centimet squared to be really uh

328
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,440
competitive against hydrogen for example

329
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,720
we need to be uh one or two amp per cm

330
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,800
squar and we think to do that we need to

331
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,079
engineer the Catalyst we also need to go

332
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,040
to higher temperature and pressure and

333
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,800
so uh sort of situating in a university

334
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:47,720
lab we do have issues with you know we

335
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,440
need funding and and also you know uh um

336
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,759
I would say a multidisciplinary approach

337
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,720
uh to increase the you know intensify

338
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,759
this process right now it is uh still at

339
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,759
a university lab level

340
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
question any more

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,160
questions where oh I have a question uh

342
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,519
can you read the question the screen uh

343
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,519
Professor

344
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:25,000
Julie how much energy needed uh gig per

345
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:29,839
Tong uh so uh we are uh as I said uh

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,600
about uh 30% efficient so this is much

347
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,880
less than hydrogen cycle so whatever

348
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,399
hydrogen number you get uh you sort of

349
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,440
need to multiply that by maybe a factor

350
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:45,680
two so uh so right now the round trip

351
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Energy Efficiency is is quite low still
