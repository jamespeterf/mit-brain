1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,320
Okay. So let's continue discussing uh

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
the proof of burgans production theorem

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
and how it's similar and different from

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,439
the corresponding statement in the final

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,039
field setting. Um so just as a quick

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,920
review because we are going to keep

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,920
working uh with this concept uh a delta

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,880
S C

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,880
D set

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,760
is a subset

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,840
of let's say the unit ball

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,440
or maybe the unit cube. It doesn't

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,239
really matter. So it has to live in some

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:57,719
bounded region of space such that

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,719
if we intersect X with a ball

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,280
and look at the delta covering number,

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,840
this is controlled by well first of all

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,200
this tolerance constant C then the

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,200
radius of the ball to the power s

20
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:19,360
and then the size of all of.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
So it is a spacing condition and

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
although this is not part of the

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
definition

24
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,720
it's convenient to imagine that the size

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,799
of x is maybe delta to the minus s

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,560
although it doesn't have to be but it is

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,240
in the setting of bugans projection

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,479
theorem as I stated it

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,119
and speaking of bugans projection

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,520
theorem as I stated it let me state the

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,360
version well not the version it's really

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,159
exactly the same theorem I stated last

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,000
time but using this language. So,

34
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
Borgans projection theorem again. So,

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
it's really exactly the same statement

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,799
just using this language

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,960
and rescaling.

38
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,960
Suppose that X is in the unit B2

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,280
and is a delta oh sorry quantifiers. So

40
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,599
given

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,640
t between zero and two

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,160
is strictly positive at most one there

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,920
exist or there exist two parameters

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,959
epsilon and ea positive depending on t

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:34,400
and s so that the following happens

46
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:39,040
if x is a delta t delta to the minus ea

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,360
uh set in R2 2 with

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,160
size

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,599
delta to the minus t

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,130
and d the set of directions

51
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,760
uh let's say in 01

52
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:58,599
[Applause]

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,599
is a delta s delta to the minus ea set

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,560
then there exist a direction

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,080
in our set of directions

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:17,360
such that if you look at the minimum

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,680
over all subsets of X which are dense in

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
the sense that the delta covering number

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,400
is at least delta EA this tolerance

60
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
parameter

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,560
times the delta covering number of X and

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,440
we project

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,560
the subset then no matter how I choose

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,519
the subset

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,760
We get a gain over the between quotes

66
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,239
trivial bound which is less trivial in

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
this setting but nevertheless

68
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,760
uh this is at least delta to the minus t

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,640
/ 2 minus epsilon. So epsilon is how

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,040
much we gain and delta to the minus ea

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,040
is our tolerance.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Okay, this is really the same theorem as

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,480
last time. Last time x was in the radius

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,400
r and it was a union of unit balls but

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,319
we just scale it down by a scale of 1 /

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,680
r and by the equivalences for measuring

77
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,599
the delta covering number that I

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,760
mentioned last time this is really the

79
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,760
same statement.

80
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Okay.

81
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,240
Okay. Okay, so last time we saw that the

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,120
following is true even though we didn't

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,120
actually prove all of it.

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
Last time we saw that there exist a

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,960
polomial

86
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:43,040
uh which is just x1 x2 x3 - x4 x5 x6 or

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:47,000
okay that works. So exist a polomial

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,000
such that for every

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,400
s between zero and one

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
and okay I didn't state it this way last

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
time but maybe let's introduce also the

92
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,320
two parameters here last time I stated

93
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
it with just one parameter of course you

94
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,639
can just take epsilon and it to be the

95
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,120
same by taking the minimum so the whole

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,160
statement if you replace epsilon or and

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
ora by a smaller number is still true so

98
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
we could just take the minimum and have

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
just one parameter but I sort of want to

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
distinguish them because they play

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,039
different roles. Okay. So there exists

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,320
epsilon anita such that

103
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,840
if a is

104
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,840
delta

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,759
s delta to the minus ea

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,120
set

107
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,400
maybe contained in 01

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,560
and maybe let's assume also that the

109
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:47,360
size of a is delta to the minus s then

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
the size grows by applying this polomial

111
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,639
Okay. And we discussed that uh this is

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
not enough to iterate because in order

113
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
to iterate we need to know that Q of A

114
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,560
also satisfies these assumptions and

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,120
this is not clear at all and in fact is

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,120
not true. So need to improve

117
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,759
to

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,360
Q of A contains

119
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:25,199
a delta S plus epsilon delta to the

120
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,479
minus EA set.

121
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,600
If we knew this then we could iterate

122
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,520
and keep growing. So keep adding epsilon

123
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,039
and because epsilon is continuous in s

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
we can get as close to delta to the

125
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,160
minus one as we want.

126
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,319
Okay. So uh today we will discuss how to

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,560
do this. So let me say that it's not

128
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,199
going to be the same epsilon and ea. So

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,000
they're going to they're going to yeah

130
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,000
they will become much smaller

131
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,600
but same order of quantifier. So there

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,800
exist s for every s there will exist eta

133
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,800
and epsilon. So that this is true.

134
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,360
Okay. So this is what we are going to

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,160
mostly discuss today and hopefully then

136
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,400
go briefly over how to uh finish the

137
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
proof. But I would say this is the main

138
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,880
difference with respect to the finite

139
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,199
field setting where we don't have to

140
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,800
worry about any of these. Okay. So

141
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,000
before coming back to this we'll take a

142
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,000
detour and then uh we'll come back. So

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
let me state a lema with some basic

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,039
properties

145
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,840
of delta s c sets.

146
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,000
Suppose that x

147
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,960
is a

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,960
delta s c set in any dimension.

149
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,199
Then we make the following two fairly

150
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
easy but important observations. So

151
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,880
maybe I should have done this last time

152
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,599
to get some intuition about what this

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,840
concept does. First of all, X is large

154
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,560
at all scales. So the row covering

155
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,479
number of X is at least C to the minus

156
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,520
one row to the minus S for every

157
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,520
row between delta and one.

158
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,120
I mentioned in passing last time that

159
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,360
this is true for row equals delta, but

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,280
in fact it's true for every row.

161
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,720
And two, this concept is robust and

162
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,960
they're passing to subsets. So if X or

163
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,120
maybe Y is a subset of X and the delta

164
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,039
covering number

165
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,919
is let's say 1 / K times the delta

166
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,039
covering number of X

167
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:46,519
then Y is

168
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,519
delta S C * K set.

169
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,800
So the constant C gets worse by

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
the parameter measuring how dense Y is

171
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,040
in X always using delta covering

172
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
numbers.

173
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,989
[Applause]

174
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,080
Okay. So the proof of this is fairly

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240
simple. So let's do it. We have to prove

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,080
something. Well, we need to show that

177
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,279
the row covering number is something. So

178
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
the definition of the row covering

179
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,720
number is the smallest number of row

180
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,560
balls needed to cover the set. So let's

181
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,560
cover the set by row balls.

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,839
And let's see how many balls we need. So

183
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,839
let's say we cover the set by

184
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,440
m balls of radius row.

185
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,839
Well then the delta covering number of

186
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,240
a. So the delta covering number is

187
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,240
subjective. Something which will be very

188
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,640
will come out repeatedly today. And this

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,880
is just because if we have a delta cover

190
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,040
sorry a row cover sorry a delta cover we

191
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,760
are covering by reduce delta now if we

192
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,200
have a delta cover of each of these we

193
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,839
can put them together and we get a delta

194
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,160
cover of this. So for this reason the

195
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,399
delta covering number is sub additive.

196
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,880
Okay, so the delta covering number of a

197
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,360
is at most

198
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,640
the sum of the delta covering numbers of

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,640
a intersected with these balls.

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,600
But by definition of delta covering set,

201
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:24,640
each of these is at most c row to the

202
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,399
s times the delta covering number of a.

203
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,320
So we have a uniform upper bound that

204
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,839
only depends on row. So the center

205
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
doesn't matter. So this is just the

206
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,760
definition of

207
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,839
a being a delta c set.

208
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,600
Okay. So this is at most m c row to the

209
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
s

210
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
delta covering number of a. So we see

211
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,200
that we can cancel out the delta

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,320
covering number of a and we get the

213
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,680
claim one.

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,000
So we get that m is at least

215
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,600
what is on the right hand side there.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,720
But the smallest possible M is by

217
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,720
definition the rock covering number.

218
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Okay.

219
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,320
Okay. And two is even easier.

220
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, uh we have to show that y is a

221
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:26,079
delta uh dc of course should be s.

222
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
So we have to y satisfies the definition

223
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,480
of delta covering number. So of delta is

224
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:36,360
set. So we intersect with the ball

225
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,360
of radius row.

226
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,839
Well y is contained in x. So this is at

227
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,560
most

228
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:50,079
the same thing with x instead of row.

229
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,760
But x is a delta s set. So this is at

230
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,279
most

231
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,600
c * row to the s times the delta

232
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,680
covering number of x

233
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
but the delta covering number of x is at

234
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,959
most k times by the delta covering

235
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,920
number of y by assumption.

236
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,120
So this is at most ck

237
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:16,160
row to the s delta covering number of y.

238
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:21,320
So we have checked that y is a

239
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,320
delta s ck set.

240
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,680
Okay. So what what information have we

241
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
gained regarding our task? So we need to

242
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,800
show that q of a contains a delta s plus

243
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,079
epsilon delta to the minus ea set. Well,

244
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,639
if it contains such a set, then Q of A

245
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,440
must satisfy the conclusion of the first

246
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,079
part of the lema. So the row covering

247
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,600
number of Q of A has to be large. We

248
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,639
have proved that the delta covering

249
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,079
number is large. But it is necess it is

250
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,720
ne it's not sufficient but it's

251
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,360
necessary to show that Q of A grows at

252
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,279
every scale. Right? We want to show that

253
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,200
it contains a delta T over 2 plus

254
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,760
epsilon

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,160
something set. So it needs to be large

256
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,160
at all scales.

257
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,499
[Applause]

258
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,800
Okay. So uh we see that

259
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,800
we need

260
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:33,040
q of a a scale row to be larger than row

261
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,360
to the minus t / 2 minus minus epsilon

262
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,200
for every row between delta and one and

263
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,200
a purely we only know it for delta. So

264
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,680
what we discussed last time is that this

265
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,680
is true for delta

266
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,320
and again this is not sufficient. Yes

267
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,760
that say row to the minus s minus

268
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,800
epsilon

269
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,959
>> row to the okay so now okay so this this

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,279
is was a general statement about delta

271
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,360
sets and now I'm going back to what we

272
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,040
are trying to achieve.

273
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,120
Oh sorry s yeah yeah so there is sorry

274
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,320
yeah so this is still not buggans

275
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,760
production theorem we are working with

276
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,600
just one setting 01 thank you

277
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,320
okay um

278
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,399
we need this to be true

279
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,360
and okay so one could think that we have

280
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,240
it for free because why can't we just

281
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,680
apply

282
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,680
what we know at scale row

283
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,760
So this is a question for you. So why so

284
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,320
again uh this is necessary is not

285
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,000
sufficient but okay let's try to focus

286
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,680
on getting this first. So why why do why

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,279
don't we get it for free?

288
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
So what is the difference between row

289
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,920
and delta?

290
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
So that's the assumption that we have

291
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,519
over there.

292
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
Yes,

293
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,880
>> because we don't know that a

294
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
sum.

295
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,639
>> Well, okay. So, the assumption is that a

296
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,440
is a delta s something set. And you're

297
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,320
right. We don't know that a is a row s

298
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,959
something set. Uh there is another thing

299
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,720
that could be a bit worrying. I would

300
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,399
say is less worrying which is that delta

301
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
to the minus epsilon is not row to the

302
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,760
minus epsilon.

303
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
We would need row to the minus epilon.

304
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,360
Delta to the minus epsilon is much

305
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,040
bigger. This last thing is not so

306
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,680
serious because we can always

307
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,440
okay the last thing is not so ser okay

308
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,839
okay neither of them is so serious in

309
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
some sense but okay the second one maybe

310
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,160
we'll come back to discussing later but

311
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,480
it is less serious the main issue is

312
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,480
that okay so we don't get this for free

313
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,279
Because

314
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,600
a needs not be

315
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,279
and delta row delta to the minus epsilon

316
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,440
set.

317
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,440
Okay. And we also would need row here.

318
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
But let's ignore this for a moment. And

319
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
my parameters are all wrong. Row s delta

320
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,240
minus epsilon set.

321
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
And also okay even if we did uh we still

322
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,320
have the issue that this is necessary

323
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,320
but not sufficient.

324
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,519
So this condition is necessary but not

325
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,600
sufficient for Q of A to contain the

326
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,160
delta S plus epsilon delta to the minus

327
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,839
EA set.

328
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,920
Okay. So we are going to overcome these

329
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,639
two issues by passing to what is known

330
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,639
as uniform sets. So now we make a new

331
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,519
detour and we are going to study uniform

332
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,160
sets and so uniform sets and

333
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,839
uniformization come up all the time in

334
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,640
studying these type of problems not only

335
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,839
in this proof. So maybe will come up

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,839
again later in the course but it is what

337
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,000
we are going to use to overcome these

338
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,000
two issues.

339
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,360
Okay. So,

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,160
Okay. So let's start by defining what a

341
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,160
uniform set is. So definition

342
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,559
um okay so maybe before definition

343
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,559
uh let's

344
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,480
let's do some notation so we can write

345
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,240
the definition.

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,320
So this is from last time but recall

347
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:21,000
that I was denoting the delta

348
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,000
to be the delta mesh cubes.

349
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:35,039
So we split RD into cubes of side length

350
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,160
delta and one of them has a vertex at

351
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:42,559
the origin.

352
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,120
Okay. So let's define dta of a set x

353
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,160
to be the cubes. This is in any

354
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,400
dimension. So the cubes that are heat by

355
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,480
x.

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,039
So these are the q cubes of sin f delta

357
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,039
with heat x.

358
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,120
And let's define a box counting version

359
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:15,600
of a delta covering number by looking at

360
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,280
this. So uh let's define x delta star to

361
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,039
distinguish it from the delta covering

362
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,559
number

363
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,559
to be the cardality of this set.

364
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,640
How many delta cubes the set hits. And

365
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,880
we discussed last time that up to a

366
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,400
multiplicative constant that could

367
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,320
depend on the ambient dimension but we

368
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
don't care. This is really the same as

369
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,760
the delta covering number. So in some

370
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,440
sense they are the same but in order to

371
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,200
work with uniform sets is this version

372
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,919
is better

373
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,919
as we will see.

374
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,520
Okay. So we are counting how many of

375
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,520
these are hit by the set X and we can

376
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,679
compare cubes with balls. And this is

377
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,320
why these two things are comparable as

378
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,919
we discussed last time.

379
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:09,200
Okay. Now we can give a definition

380
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,120
of uniform sets. So a set x and now our

381
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,440
reference bounded part of space is going

382
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,440
to be the unit ball not the unit ball

383
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,200
the unit cube not the unit ball the unit

384
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,520
cube. So 0 one to the d

385
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,640
is

386
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,640
delta m uniform.

387
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Okay. What is delta is a parameter in

388
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:36,760
01. So it's a number in 01 and what is m

389
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,760
a natural number

390
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
and you should think so I will maybe

391
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,039
come back to this but you should think

392
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,120
that delta is fixed but m is not. So we

393
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,240
fix delta and let m go to infinity

394
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,080
something like this. So we're going to

395
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,159
fix delta and then m will grow. But this

396
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,159
is just a definition.

397
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,159
if

398
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,559
uh the following happens.

399
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,720
So for every jet

400
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,720
between zero and n minus one

401
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,760
and for every

402
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:22,679
cube of

403
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,679
size delta to the j that intersects x.

404
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,679
We look at how many cubes of the next

405
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:34,159
generation hit X and the next generation

406
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,320
is delta to the J + one cubes.

407
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,640
So for every

408
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,120
scale delta to the J. So we're going to

409
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,640
look at scales delta to the J. For every

410
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,039
cube of one of these scales that

411
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,039
intersects the set, we look at

412
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:04,640
How many sorry star how many cubes

413
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:07,200
of the next generation scale hit X and

414
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,200
this is some number that depends on the

415
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,480
scale J but it doesn't depend on the

416
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,480
particular cube Q.

417
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,360
Okay, let's draw a picture. So,

418
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,760
let's draw a picture to understand

419
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,760
what's going on.

420
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,760
And I guess we actually want delta to be

421
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,919
not just a number in 01 but actually a

422
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,679
diadic number. Okay, this is a

423
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,919
definition. So but in practice want to

424
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,080
get a diagic number. So things are

425
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,280
nested. Okay, so let's draw a picture to

426
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,440
understand what's going on. Suppose that

427
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,039
delta is 1/2

428
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,000
and we are in dimension two.

429
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:11,159
Okay, so uh we look at okay we have a

430
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,159
set X. Let's say that X hits this three

431
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,360
diadic squares of first level but it

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,360
doesn't hit this one. Then R0 will be

433
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,360
three.

434
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,440
There is only one cube of first level

435
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,760
which is the unit cube by the assumption

436
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,799
that Q lives in the unit cube. So the

437
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,039
unit cube has size delta to the zero and

438
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,000
x hits just one of those because it's

439
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,360
contained in the unit cube. Okay. Now we

440
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,320
split each of the surviving squares

441
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,240
again diagically.

442
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640
And what uniformity means is that the

443
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,480
number in each of these three cubes that

444
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
are hit by x is the same for all three

445
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,720
cubes. But the actual cubes could be

446
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,200
different. So for example

447
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,720
X could hit this one, this one, this

448
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,120
one, this one, this one and this one.

449
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,600
So this is a possibility and in this

450
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,159
case R1 will be two.

451
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,320
So every of these three cubes that

452
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:15,440
survive survived in the first generation

453
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,200
hit two cubes of the second generation.

454
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,400
And what is important is that it is two.

455
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,039
Two and two. The same for all the cubes.

456
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,120
This is what makes it uniform.

457
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,039
Okay. Now we could keep going. So maybe

458
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,320
in the next generation every one of

459
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,559
these will hit just one.

460
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,159
It could be anywhere.

461
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:40,880
Okay. Then R2 would be one. Okay. Is it

462
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:44,480
clear what a uniform set is?

463
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,440
Okay. So uh we can see the set x as a

464
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,520
tree where the root is the unit cube.

465
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
The vertices of first level. So the

466
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,360
children of the unit cube are the

467
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,640
squares of size 1/2 hitting the set. The

468
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,640
cubes of size

469
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,279
1/2 square. So delta square will be the

470
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,279
children of the

471
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,440
vertices of the first level and so on.

472
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
Yes. How does this work when delta isn't

473
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,159
the reciprocal of an integer and you

474
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,000
have this kind of data

475
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,440
>> otherwise things don't line up exactly

476
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,520
it's not the end of the world but in

477
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,960
practice okay in practice we will see

478
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,120
that we are free to pick delta

479
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
satisfying certain well at this stage

480
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,919
delta could be anything but yeah we are

481
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,520
going to pick delta by addic

482
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,840
no not just reciprocal of an integer but

483
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,640
reciprocal of a power of two just just

484
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,320
in case yeah otherwise things are not

485
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,000
exactly nested and this picture is not

486
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,799
as neat okay so these numbers are Okay,

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,240
we call them so we can view as a tree X

488
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,880
as a tree and for this reason we call

489
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,880
them branching numbers.

490
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,360
Okay, I'm having a very bad Blackboard

491
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,279
management.

492
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,679
So let's show this again for a second.

493
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:14,400
So in general

494
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:18,880
if we have a row s delta sorry a delta s

495
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:22,720
c set it does not need to be a row a row

496
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,640
s c set but if the set is uniform it is.

497
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,200
So this is one big advantage of working

498
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,200
with uniform sets. So let's say so this

499
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,200
will

500
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,880
overcome this issue and also actually

501
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,120
this issue. If the set is uniform then

502
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,760
this condition is not only necessary but

503
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,440
sufficient

504
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,240
for the set to be

505
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,600
yeah so I if we knew that Q of A is

506
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,919
uniform which we don't but okay we we we

507
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,720
have to work a lot to actually make this

508
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,559
work for us but if we have a uniform set

509
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,600
then both of these issues are overcome

510
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:09,039
so if the set is uniform and it is a

511
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,520
delta SC set it is a row is slightly

512
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,840
worse C set

513
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,480
and if the set satisfies that is large

514
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,640
at every scale then it is a delta SC

515
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,880
set. So both of these issues are

516
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,480
overcome by working with uniform sets.

517
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,720
Okay, let let me state

518
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,840
how it works.

519
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,840
So let okay lema.

520
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,840
So let x

521
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,880
the be delta m uniform

522
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,440
and the delta big delta to the m.

523
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,240
So again at some point we are going to

524
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,080
fix big delta and then this is not a

525
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,679
restriction. This is really not a

526
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,480
restriction because delta will be a

527
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,880
constant. So if delta small delta is not

528
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,320
big delta to the m we sandwich it

529
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,799
between big delta to the m and big delta

530
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,200
to the m plus one and work with those

531
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,200
powers. So this is not a big

532
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,200
restriction.

533
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,480
Then if

534
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,080
the size of X is large,

535
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,399
let's say 1 / C

536
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,320
row to the minus S

537
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,640
for every row. But in fact, we don't

538
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,200
even need every row. Let's say for every

539
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,240
row in one delta

540
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,200
delta to the M. So we only need this to

541
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,360
be true for powers of delta. But the

542
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,919
point is if we know that the size of X

543
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,480
is large at every scale then

544
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,399
X is

545
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,000
delta

546
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:09,600
S

547
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,320
and not quite C set but uh

548
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,480
well up to some constant that depends on

549
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,240
delta but because delta will be fixed at

550
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,240
some point this is harmless.

551
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,240
So for uniform sets

552
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,320
it is sufficient to be large at all

553
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:33,320
scales for the set to be a delta s c

554
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,320
set.

555
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,159
Okay. And what was the other issue that

556
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:46,279
we wanted to overcome? It's it's

557
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,279
oh okay and this one as well.

558
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:55,600
And if

559
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:58,559
X so X is a uniform set. If X is a delta

560
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:05,039
S c set

561
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:07,039
then X is a row S and again

562
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,720
not quite C but we lose something that

563
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,480
depends on delta. So we are happy

564
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,240
set

565
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,240
for every row between delta and one.

566
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,120
Okay, maybe an exercise for you is to

567
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,039
think about why both of these claims are

568
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,120
false if we don't assume that the city

569
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,320
is uniform. It does have to be uniform.

570
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,520
It's not true in general.

571
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,080
>> Any questions?

572
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,600
>> Yes.

573
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,880
>> I was a little bit confused like if acts

574
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,039
like

575
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,000
in the world that would cover like you

576
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,240
said like one problem is like X is not a

577
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,960
row S something.

578
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:56,480
>> Yes. Um what if like like if f if x was

579
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:58,080
like row s that's why does that imply q

580
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,080
x

581
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,080
has

582
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,799
>> okay so what we saw last time is that if

583
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:14,080
a is a delta s c set if forget about

584
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,960
what is the c then q of a at scale delta

585
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,679
grows.

586
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,799
>> Yeah. Well,

587
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:25,279
that is true for every delta. So if the

588
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,880
original a was also a

589
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,679
row s c set, then we could apply what we

590
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,399
did last time with row instead of delta

591
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,399
and get this conclusion.

592
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,240
the polomial is fixed. So in the order

593
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,600
of quantifiers, so maybe this is still

594
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,200
on some board. Yeah, you see the

595
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,799
polinomial comes first. The polinomial

596
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,240
is fixed. So it's actually a a minus a a

597
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,519
>> the polinomial doesn't depend on s

598
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,880
doesn't depend on row doesn't depend on

599
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,960
c doesn't depend on anything. It's a

600
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,600
completely universal polinomial. So it's

601
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,679
really a a minus aa or

602
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,679
>> there are other options.

603
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,679
Yeah.

604
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,320
Okay. Um,

605
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,200
okay. So now we are seeing both dilemma

606
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,600
and you sort of see why dilemma will be

607
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,480
helpful. Although one has to be careful

608
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,559
and we will be careful because

609
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,799
in order to

610
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,919
uh overcome this we need a to be a row s

611
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,279
something set. So if a was uniform we

612
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,080
would be happy. But for the second one

613
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,159
we need q of a to be uniform. Not a but

614
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,679
q of a. So to overcome one issue we need

615
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,120
a to be uniform. To overcome the other

616
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,440
issue we need q of a to be uniform. So

617
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,919
we still will have work to do. But okay

618
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,080
let's go step by step and let's prove

619
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,080
this lema.

620
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,279
And the proof of dilemma will also help

621
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,840
us understand and sort of work with

622
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,840
uniform sets.

623
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,480
Okay. So the idea is to do everything

624
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,640
just at the scales powers of delta and

625
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,320
any other scale we can sandwich between

626
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,480
powers of delta because delta is a

627
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,120
constant the sandwiching will only lose

628
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:47,760
a constant depending on delta. So uh for

629
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:51,960
the first okay let me just give it

630
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,960
letters A and B.

631
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,170
[Applause]

632
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:07,480
So for a um well let's consider row some

633
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,480
power of delta

634
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,720
then uh what is so we have to look at

635
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,560
the intersection of a with a ball of

636
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,359
radius row but instead of a ball of

637
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,720
radius row let's use a cube of size row

638
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,800
and again we can always pass between

639
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,240
cubes and balls losing only constants

640
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,520
and this makes sense because we want to

641
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,800
use the assumption that the set is

642
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:32,800
uniform okay so let's take a 2 in

643
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,760
delta

644
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,599
d delta to the j of

645
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,359
I guess I called it x.

646
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,359
Okay, we fix one of the scales delta to

647
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,399
the j. We fix a cube that intersects the

648
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:52,480
set and

649
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:54,399
what is this delta is delta to the m.

650
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
So here we are jumping from scale delta

651
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,599
to the j to delta to the m. When we jump

652
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,720
from scale delta to the j to delta to

653
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:07,200
the j + one,

654
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,119
we have r j + one children.

655
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,119
Each of those children has r to the j +2

656
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:18,160
children

657
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,240
and so on up to r m minus one

658
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,920
with the star. So you see what I have. I

659
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,839
want you to have the star. Without the

660
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,839
star we this would be true up to

661
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,839
constants.

662
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:36,960
Okay, so every time we go down one

663
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,400
scale, every cube splits into R

664
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,040
depending on the scale number of

665
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,440
offspring. And the point is it doesn't

666
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,680
matter where the set is with the number

667
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,560
of offspring is fixed but the assumption

668
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:53,200
that the set is uniform.

669
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:57,040
Okay. So let's write this as R1

670
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:00,040
R MUS1 divided by R1

671
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,040
RJ.

672
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,680
What is the numerator?

673
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,640
Sorry, zero. We start at zero.

674
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:23,280
What is the numerator?

675
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,880
>> Yes.

676
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,240
>> The delta not covering number of x

677
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,880
because we start at the top and we go

678
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,440
all the way down to the bottom.

679
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,640
So the numerator

680
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,520
is the delta covering number of a.

681
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,520
And what is the denominator?

682
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,680
Sorry, actually we start at J because of

683
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,599
the way we define things. So we stop at

684
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
J minus one. So J J J J J J J J J J J J

685
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,160
J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J

686
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,720
J J J J J J J J J J + one I think now is

687
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,440
correct. Yes denominator just the del

688
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,040
capital delta to the j covering of a

689
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,960
>> exactly this is the

690
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,160
delta to the j covering number I guess

691
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,760
we would start

692
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,720
because we split into r o uh children

693
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,880
then r1 and so on and if we stop here we

694
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,680
stopped at the scale delta to the j big

695
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,560
delta to the j okay and now we use the

696
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,599
assumption in part a the assumption is

697
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,359
that sorry I keep switching around a and

698
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,400
x

699
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,599
the assumption is that this is large so

700
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,400
the fraction is small so the assumption

701
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,839
is that so this is smaller actually a

702
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,560
constant because now I'm going to go

703
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,119
back to standard delta covering numbers

704
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,119
uh this is c

705
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,240
row to the s

706
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:01,599
delta covering number of n

707
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,160
x sorry

708
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:08,720
so we are done.

709
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,880
So we took a cube of size

710
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:16,320
uh delta to the j sorry

711
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,000
delta to the j. So this is row s. So we

712
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,880
took a cube of size delta to the j. So

713
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,119
delta to the j is our row and we show

714
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,240
that the delta covering number of that

715
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,880
is a constant row to the s and the delta

716
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,040
covering number of x.

717
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,040
Okay. So this shows

718
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,680
X is a

719
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,680
delta C set

720
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,800
at scales

721
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,599
one delta

722
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,119
delta to the M.

723
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:03,760
So it satisfies the condition of being

724
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:09,079
delta S maybe 01. O of C O of 1* C at

725
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,079
these scales. But then we sandwich

726
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,960
a scale row

727
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,119
in delta 1 between two of these

728
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,680
and we are going to lose some power of

729
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,920
delta

730
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,079
by this sandwiching. We are going to

731
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,240
lose a power of delta in the constant.

732
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,800
So this is why the constant in the claim

733
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,800
depends on delta.

734
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,480
Okay, an exercise is to fill in these

735
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,240
details. But hopefully this convinces

736
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,560
you that this the claim is true.

737
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,560
Any questions?

738
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,839
Okay. And the second part of the lema

739
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,720
say is that if the original set was a

740
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,720
delta s set then it is also a row

741
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,720
slightly

742
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,119
worse c set.

743
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,119
Okay. And um

744
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,560
it is a very similar argument.

745
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,000
Okay. So it is really the same argument.

746
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,800
So we do exactly the same thing again

747
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,200
except that now instead of delta we have

748
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,320
to write row. Okay let's do it again but

749
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,320
it's it's basically the same argument.

750
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:18,079
Okay. B. So assume

751
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,800
that row is delta to the J. Otherwise we

752
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,800
sandwich before

753
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,480
maybe delta to the J zero.

754
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,720
Okay. And then we have to look at x

755
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,040
intersection. Okay. So now we take a j

756
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,720
uh which is

757
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,520
at most j0 because we have to see what

758
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:56,720
happens when we intercepted x with cubes

759
00:41:51,520 --> 00:42:00,480
or balls of size larger than row. Now

760
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:05,079
and let's pick a cube

761
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,079
well of size larger than row.

762
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,400
Then we intersect X with Q. And now we

763
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,760
look at

764
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,440
the row covering number.

765
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,839
But it is exactly the same story as

766
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:27,160
before. So what is this? This is R J0

767
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,160
blah blah blah R J minus one.

768
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,880
>> Does it start at RJ and goes to RJ 0us

769
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,880
one?

770
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Yes.

771
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,400
Okay. And this is R1

772
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:58,079
RJ 0 - one.

773
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,880
Sorry. R0 R 0* R0

774
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,880
R J minus one.

775
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,079
And this is

776
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:11,240
the covering number at scale delta to

777
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,240
the J0

778
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,599
divided by the delta covering number at

779
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,599
scale delta to the J.

780
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:34,480
And because the set is a

781
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,200
delta s c set this is at most after a

782
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,960
constant because I'm going to now delete

783
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,680
the star

784
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,680
uh this is at most

785
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,640
c

786
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,440
let's write it like row to the

787
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,440
sorry

788
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,680
Okay, let's try to do this correctly. So

789
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,280
what is this? So here we start at the

790
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,400
top and go up to scale delta to the J0

791
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,119
which is row. So this is actually a the

792
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,400
original set

793
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,480
At scale row,

794
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,359
we start at the top. We go down to scale

795
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,040
delta to the j zero.

796
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,640
>> A or f.

797
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,720
>> Sorry, sorry about that. X. I should

798
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,880
just call it a and then but if I call it

799
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,560
a in the statement then I will write x.

800
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,160
So it's not going to work. It's x. There

801
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:46,319
is just one set which is x.

802
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:50,800
Okay. and the denominator is a delta

803
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,119
to the j covering number of x. Okay, in

804
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,960
the numerator I just write uh the row

805
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,960
covering number of x without the star

806
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,079
and for the denominator we use a

807
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,560
previous lema. So uh we previously see I

808
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,760
think it's not in any board anymore or

809
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,599
maybe it is yeah it is there we saw that

810
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,319
if we have a delta SC c set then the row

811
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,240
covering number is at least row to the

812
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:22,680
minus s divided by c. So we use that at

813
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,680
this scale. So this is our R.

814
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:35,119
Okay. And so

815
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,920
uh so this has size

816
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,160
r equals delta to the j. So we have

817
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,480
shown what we wanted.

818
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,960
So now if we replace

819
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,319
cubes by balls and we interpolate

820
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,200
scales. So we use just powers of delta

821
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:56,319
we get that

822
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:59,040
x intersection evol of radius r

823
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,440
row covering number is at most a

824
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,720
constant at most a constant that depends

825
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,480
on delta that comes from the sandwiching

826
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,160
the original constant that is here then

827
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,240
this is actually row to the minus s in

828
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,000
the denominator

829
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,079
r to the minus s in the denominator so

830
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,079
we get r to the X and then the row

831
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,200
covering number of X and that's the

832
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,720
definition of being a row

833
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,760
is

834
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,760
slightly worsey set

835
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,760
questions.

836
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,000
Okay. So we have seen that uniform sets

837
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,319
are much better behaved. We can

838
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,079
well first of all if it is a good set at

839
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,960
scale delta it is a good set at coarser

840
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,880
scales as well and also it's enough to

841
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,480
know that the set is large at all scales

842
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,440
to know that it has this spacing

843
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,560
condition. So how do we find uniform

844
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,359
sets? So this is the content of the next

845
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,160
lema which is simple but extremely

846
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:10,359
important and has uh lots and lots of

847
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,359
applications all over the place.

848
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,599
in particular for what we are trying to

849
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,599
do.

850
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,599
Okay, let

851
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:52,240
little delta be big delta to the m

852
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:55,680
and let x be a subset of 01 to the d.

853
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,400
So we assume nothing about x and what

854
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:03,680
the lema says is that x contains a dense

855
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:06,560
between quotes uniform subset.

856
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,480
Okay. Uh so what does what does dense

857
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,839
mean? Well, it means different things in

858
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,079
different settings. So, I'm going to

859
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:15,359
prove a slightly more general versions.

860
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:20,400
So, let mu

861
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:23,400
be a subaditive set function

862
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,400
finitely

863
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,079
set function like like a measure. But

864
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,160
the only aim I assume is that mu of a

865
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,680
plus b is less or equal than mu of a

866
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,680
plus mu of b. nothing nothing else.

867
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,599
And

868
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,119
a very good example to keep in mind

869
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,559
which is one of the examples where this

870
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,800
is useful but not the only one. This is

871
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,760
why I state a more general version is

872
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,800
that mu of B can be the delta covering

873
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,960
number of P.

874
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,040
So this is not a measure because it is

875
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,240
not additive. It is extremely far from

876
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,240
additive but it is sub additive.

877
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,400
Okay. Then uh there exists

878
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:16,480
y which is contained in x which is

879
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:20,200
well two things happen. One is that y is

880
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,200
delta m uniform

881
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,200
and the second thing is that y is large

882
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,119
measured by mu.

883
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,280
mu of y

884
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,240
is large compared to what compared to mu

885
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,440
of x. So mu of x could be anything. We

886
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,400
don't know what it is. Mu is something

887
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,000
very general. Okay. And we do lose

888
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,680
something. We lose something like 2

889
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,680
delta

890
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:49,079
log 1 / big delta 2d sorry 2d is the

891
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,079
ambient dimension

892
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,960
to the m to the minus n.

893
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,160
Okay. Okay, so here the point is that

894
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,520
the scale is delta to the m and here we

895
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,599
have log of 1 / delta to the m. So we

896
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:14,520
lose something exponential but if delta

897
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,520
is small is a very small exponential.

898
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:22,000
Maybe let's write it in this equivalent

899
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:29,040
way. This is delta to the minus

900
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:34,319
sigma mu of x where sigma is logarithm

901
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:37,359
of 2d logarithm of 1 / delta.

902
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:41,640
So it's a double log

903
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,640
divided by log of 1 / delta.

904
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,920
So if we make delta small enough, we can

905
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,520
make sigma arbitrarily close to zero. So

906
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,400
in practice at some point we are going

907
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,480
to choose this delta so that this is

908
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,760
small enough for our purposes and from

909
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:02,200
that point on delta will be fixed but m

910
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,200
will not so m will go to infinity.

911
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:13,200
Okay. Uh proof of dilemma

912
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,800
says delta to the minus sigma m. Is it

913
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,319
just delta to the minus sigma

914
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,319
>> plus sigma m? Sorry.

915
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,800
Yeah.

916
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,440
Yeah. So the measure, it doesn't have to

917
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,079
be a measure, but the measure of Y is

918
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,800
not much smaller than the measure of X,

919
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,960
but not much smaller. Okay. Depends on

920
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,119
your point of view. So we do some we do

921
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,200
lo do some exponential thing. But this

922
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,960
sigma is as small as you want by

923
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,680
choosing delta small enough. Yes. So you

924
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,680
said we we fix sigma fixing delta and

925
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,760
then we let go. So does that not

926
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,559
>> Yeah, it blows up. So it's not a Yeah,

927
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,160
it's Yeah, it blows up, but it blows up

928
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,400
like a power but the power is

929
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,960
arbitrarily small. Sorry. Ah, sorry. Bad

930
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,440
day with typos.

931
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:08,480
Delta to the sigma.

932
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:13,280
So small delta is big delta to the m. So

933
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:16,960
big small delta is big delta to the m.

934
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:20,559
So this okay sorry about this. So this

935
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:24,359
is delta to the sigma

936
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,359
by definition of sigma

937
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,319
and actually it is delta to the minus

938
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,640
sigma.

939
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,079
Sorry this is delta to the minus sigma

940
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,200
by definition. This is the definition of

941
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,839
sigma. So this is delta to big delta to

942
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,559
the sigma n. Big delta to the sigma n is

943
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,160
small delta to the sigma. So yes as n

944
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,559
goes to infinity delta goes to zero.

945
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,119
This goes to zero but it goes to zero as

946
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,319
a power which is arbitrarily small. So

947
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,079
this is the way which you think about

948
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,319
this

949
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,240
sorry

950
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:58,720
is it is it correct now.

951
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,520
Okay. Okay. Okay, so the proof is I'm

952
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,400
clear clever pigeon holing starting from

953
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,640
the bottom of the tree. Okay, so the

954
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,640
proof is trim the tree starting from the

955
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,640
bottom.

956
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,469
[Applause]

957
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:58,599
Okay. So we have the set X and let's

958
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,599
call it XM and we are going to construct

959
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,000
by pigeon holding from the bottom we are

960
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,440
going to construct

961
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,400
a nested sequence of sets

962
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,640
all the way down to X0 and this is going

963
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,400
to be our Y that we are looking for

964
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,079
okay so let's explain I'm going to

965
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,440
explain how to construct X minus one and

966
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,359
then we just continue the same way by

967
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,839
induction ction.

968
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,520
Okay, so we have XM which is X really

969
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,800
and

970
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,640
okay. So,

971
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,640
so we have all the cubes of size delta

972
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,880
to the n minus one that intersect the

973
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,160
set but the branching numbers could be

974
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,480
different. So this could be four, this

975
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,040
could be one, this could be two, two,

976
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,480
and so on. And we want want them all to

977
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,319
be the same. So we are just going to

978
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,880
pigeon hold the sort of the most popular

979
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,400
value and okay because there are too

980
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,640
many values we are going to do it

981
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,319
diadically. So that's basically the

982
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,640
proof. Okay. So let's write it down. Uh

983
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:04,720
so let

984
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,359
x m n minus one l

985
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,839
be the union

986
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:12,640
of all the q's

987
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,480
which are squares

988
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,280
of level

989
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,680
n minus one that intersects the original

990
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,440
set

991
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,720
such that the branching number so the

992
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:29,760
number of descendants of generation

993
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:33,359
M so Q intersection X delta to the M

994
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,359
star covering number is roughly 2 to the

995
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,359
L.

996
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,800
Okay. And what are the possible values

997
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,599
of L? Well, it could be zero because

998
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,520
there is at least one because the cube

999
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,160
intersects X. There is at least one

1000
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,640
descendant. And uh the largest it could

1001
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,599
possibly be. So the largest 2 to the L

1002
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,720
can be is

1003
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,680
delta to the minus D.

1004
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,760
So each time we go down one generation

1005
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,839
uh we subdivide into relative scale one

1006
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:18,160
over delta and we have D dimensions. So

1007
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:19,760
L ranges from zero to the logarithm

1008
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:25,640
of

1009
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,640
well the logarithm of 1 / delta.

1010
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,559
Okay. So we pigeon hole. So okay mu is

1011
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,000
sub additive. So you see that this is

1012
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:38,480
what we use. So mu of x is this these

1013
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:42,720
sets cover x. So mu of x is at most the

1014
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:45,280
sum over l of mu xm.

1015
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,839
So it is x but let's write it as xm. So

1016
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,880
it's clear how to continue inductively x

1017
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:54,880
-1 l

1018
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,480
and l takes d log one / delta possible

1019
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,440
values.

1020
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:07,200
So there exists

1021
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:09,920
some L such that mu of X minus one L has

1022
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:15,280
measure at least maybe let's put a tilda

1023
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:19,880
just in case 1 / the log of 1 / delta

1024
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,880
times the measure of X.

1025
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,440
Okay. And so what the situation now? Now

1026
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,920
we know that the number of offspring is

1027
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,440
constant up to a factor of two. So here

1028
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,520
there could be seven, here there could

1029
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,040
be eight, here there could be five.

1030
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,079
Well, in that case we are going to keep

1031
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:41,040
the four with the largest mass which

1032
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:44,680
again we can do by sub additivity of mu.

1033
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,680
Okay. So inside

1034
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,920
each uh Q

1035
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,680
which is a subset of these. So the ones

1036
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:02,559
that survived keep

1037
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,559
2 to the L

1038
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,559
cubes

1039
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,760
exactly 2 to the L. So there are between

1040
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:13,599
2 to the L and 2 to the L plus one. we

1041
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,760
give exactly 2 to the L cubes of size

1042
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,520
uh delta 2D.

1043
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,160
Okay, by doing this we lose another

1044
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,280
factor of two. So this is why we have 2d

1045
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,720
log of one over delta. Maybe should be

1046
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:29,200
four or something like this. But of

1047
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:32,319
course it doesn't matter. Okay. And

1048
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:36,839
let x n minus one

1049
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,839
be the union of all of those.

1050
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Okay, so first we do diadic pigeon on

1051
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,559
holding because if diatic pigeon holding

1052
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,400
things are constant up to a factor of

1053
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,000
two then I trim against to make it

1054
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,640
exactly constant then I only lose a

1055
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:57,280
factor of two. So by doing this

1056
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:59,680
now uh we have our set xm minus one

1057
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,760
and the size sorry the size in terms of

1058
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,200
the measure so the measure could be the

1059
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,359
delta covering number but it could be

1060
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:10,799
other things. So the measure of x n

1061
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:14,000
minus one is bigger than 1 / 2 the

1062
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:16,799
log one / delta

1063
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,440
time the measure of x

1064
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:22,880
and this set is now uniform at the last

1065
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:27,200
scale. So every

1066
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:31,720
every Q

1067
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,720
that intersects this new set

1068
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:41,559
has some fixed number. Let's call it R N

1069
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,559
minus one descendants.

1070
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,319
So this will be two to the L for the L

1071
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,319
that we pigeon hold.

1072
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,760
Okay. And now we take X minus one and we

1073
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,200
keep going up until all the way up to

1074
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,599
the top until we get X0. And then we

1075
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,599
have to convince ourselves that X0

1076
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,599
works.

1077
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,480
Okay. So uh one thing is clear every

1078
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:40,559
time we iterate we lose this factor. So

1079
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:45,079
we lose this factor m times and that was

1080
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,079
the second part of the claim.

1081
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,119
and the second claim is that uh the Z Y

1082
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:08,000
is uniform.

1083
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:10,240
Well, uh every time we do this, it

1084
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,480
becomes uniform from one scale to the

1085
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,640
next and the only thing that needs to be

1086
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,760
observed is that this is preserved. So

1087
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,839
when we go up from scale n minus one to

1088
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,400
scale n minus2 we don't mess up the

1089
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:27,400
uniformity that we already had and okay

1090
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,400
let me do a proof by picture. So

1091
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,359
let's say that in the first stage we

1092
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,880
chose these two these three

1093
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,559
cubes

1094
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,200
and each of them has the same number of

1095
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,119
descendants.

1096
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,200
In the next stage we might remove some

1097
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,119
of these

1098
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,559
but it doesn't matter. So the ones let's

1099
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,240
say that we remove this one in the next

1100
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,319
stage. So the ones we keep still have

1101
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,480
the uniformity. So we don't destroy the

1102
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,799
uniformity as we that we already obtain

1103
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,240
in at finer scales when we go to coarser

1104
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:01,240
scales. So it is uniform.

1105
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,040
Okay. So

1106
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,799
this is the proof that given any set we

1107
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,119
can find a dense in this set then up to

1108
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:22,160
delta to the sigma subset which is also

1109
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,079
uniform and well by taking mu to be the

1110
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,799
delta covering number it is literally

1111
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:29,359
dense in the standard way but sometimes

1112
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:31,440
it's convenient as we will see or maybe

1113
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,040
not depending on time uh it is

1114
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,240
convenient to take other muses this is

1115
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,240
why I stated it in this Any

1116
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,599
questions? Again, all of the tools that

1117
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,599
we have been discussing today are useful

1118
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,520
not just in this proof but all over the

1119
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,920
place in projection theory. Yes,

1120
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:51,920
>> I'm not being confused like by this

1121
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:54,079
construction. Yeah, I can believe um uh

1122
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,559
on like

1123
01:02:54,079 --> 01:03:01,440
uh on level one everything uh the the

1124
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,839
degree is the same. But if you do

1125
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,000
induction for each sub tree, you can

1126
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,319
only guarantee that the degree inside

1127
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,640
each sub tree are the same. You cannot

1128
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,640
guarantee the degrees between different

1129
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,799
sub trees are equal. Right?

1130
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:18,160
>> What do you mean different sub trees?

1131
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:20,319
>> Uh like like first you you divide this

1132
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:22,799
this unit cube into four cube and you

1133
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:26,720
choose the three yellow ones and these

1134
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:30,319
three yellow ones have the same uh same

1135
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,520
same number of smaller boxes. But then

1136
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:35,680
then yeah like as my understanding you

1137
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,839
kind of do inductive argument for each

1138
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:41,440
of the three yellow boxes.

1139
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,960
>> No we start from the bottom. So what is

1140
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,799
yeah what is confusing you? You're

1141
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,640
thinking about starting from the top

1142
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:48,400
>> and you cannot start from the top

1143
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,200
precisely because of what is confusing

1144
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,839
you.

1145
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,680
>> If we don't I mean it's you cannot make

1146
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,200
it work but we start from the bottom.

1147
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,680
And this is exactly why we start from

1148
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,599
the bottom.

1149
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,520
>> Okay. when we go from the bottom to the

1150
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:02,160
top everything every uniformity that we

1151
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,359
gain is preserved when we keep iterating

1152
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,359
moving in the up direction.

1153
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,359
>> Okay.

1154
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:14,160
>> Okay. So in the remaining uh 14 minutes

1155
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,640
let's try to go back and see how all of

1156
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,880
this helps us deal with the issue that

1157
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,880
we had.

1158
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:36,280
[Applause]

1159
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,280
Maybe let's keep dilemma.

1160
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:12,200
Okay. So, let's go back. So, now we go

1161
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,200
back to our goal.

1162
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:24,799
So, a

1163
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:28,640
is a delta s. So this c is delta to the

1164
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:30,240
minus ea but that's not where the issue

1165
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,599
lies. On the other hand, if you want to

1166
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,039
write the things correctly, you have to

1167
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,119
keep track of many parameters and how

1168
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:40,119
they change and I'm not going to be able

1169
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,119
to do that today. So let's ignore this.

1170
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:49,240
So we know that Q of A

1171
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,240
has large size at scale delta.

1172
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:01,680
Okay. So the first thing we do is uh

1173
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:04,400
we replace so Q of A is AAA minus I AA.

1174
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,920
So by using same similar techniques or

1175
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,559
basically the same techniques that you

1176
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,039
already used in the finite field setting

1177
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:15,359
uh we can get the following conclusion.

1178
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:20,039
There exists one a in a such that a plus

1179
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:20,039
little a grows.

1180
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,440
Okay it's not the same epsilon. So every

1181
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,440
time I write epsilon is a different

1182
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,440
epsilon.

1183
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,039
Is that okay? Or do you want me to write

1184
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:33,280
epsilon one or

1185
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,720
we we lose a lot. So this epsilon we

1186
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:39,599
lose a lot. Okay. Uh so this is similar

1187
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:42,720
to the final field setting. This uses uh

1188
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,480
ras triangular inequality.

1189
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,200
I guess the main thing it uses is pluner

1190
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,880
rouia and as I explained last time all

1191
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,960
of these things are still true for delta

1192
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,520
covering numbers.

1193
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,520
So it uses plunic

1194
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:01,119
triangle inequality

1195
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,920
and I guess maybe some double counting.

1196
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:06,240
So I'm not saying this is trivial but I

1197
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,640
hope you did something similar in the

1198
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:12,119
final field setting.

1199
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,119
Okay, great.

1200
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,720
Okay. Uh second we can assume that a is

1201
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:25,280
uniform. Maybe okay maybe this should be

1202
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,200
so first we assume that a is uniform and

1203
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:32,200
sec second we do this maybe this is

1204
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,200
better so a is uniform

1205
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:41,000
and okay so we have to choose

1206
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,000
at this stage delta small enough

1207
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,559
um

1208
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,720
so

1209
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,119
here okay so here the mu is just the

1210
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:54,160
delta covering

1211
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,440
So we apply the uniformization lema.

1212
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,520
So we start with the delta SC set. Now

1213
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,079
we pass to a uniform subset. The uniform

1214
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,079
subset is dense up to a factor delta to

1215
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:07,039
the epsilon not epsilon delta to the

1216
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:09,680
sigma where sigma is as small as I want.

1217
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,319
Dense subsets of delta s sets are still

1218
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,319
delta s sets by the lema that we saw

1219
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,799
before. This is why we can assume this.

1220
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:18,560
Now this constant is going to become

1221
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,159
worse by a factor delta to the minus

1222
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,480
sigma

1223
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:26,520
because that's the density.

1224
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,520
So C gets worse

1225
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:34,679
by delta to the minus sigma but sigma is

1226
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,679
arbitrarily small.

1227
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,440
So I'm going to ignore it.

1228
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,279
So you have to keep track of all of

1229
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,040
these parameters but they are not the

1230
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,920
real issue. You have to be careful but

1231
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,000
they're not the real issue. Okay. Then

1232
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,759
this a still satisfies the assumptions

1233
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,239
of what we did last time. So this is

1234
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:55,120
really the first step and so we know

1235
01:08:52,239 --> 01:09:00,040
that a for the uniform one a a minus a a

1236
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,040
grows. So already this grows.

1237
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:08,640
Okay. And

1238
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:10,640
but a is uniform. So in fact uh

1239
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,239
because a is uniform by dilemma that we

1240
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,480
used about uniformity this is true at

1241
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:15,480
every scale.

1242
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:37,560
So in fact we have this at every scale.

1243
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,719
Okay. The third thing that is going to

1244
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,920
be important is that a priority we only

1245
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,920
have one a in a but in fact once we have

1246
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,679
it for one a in a we have it for almost

1247
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:56,640
all a in a. And maybe you have seen this

1248
01:09:53,679 --> 01:10:01,120
sort of uh argument in the finite field

1249
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:04,600
setting. But this is true for

1250
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,600
almost all

1251
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:14,640
a and a because uh we define a bad to be

1252
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:18,080
the points in a such that the conclusion

1253
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,560
we want. So the second step is not true.

1254
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,560
it doesn't hold.

1255
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,600
And if this set is large, we can apply

1256
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,600
the same argument to this set and get a

1257
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,600
contradiction.

1258
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,480
So a dense subset of a delta S set is a

1259
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,159
delta S slightly worse C set. How much

1260
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,400
worse the constant is depends on how

1261
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:52,400
dense a body is. So if a body is too

1262
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:56,800
dense we get a contradiction. So it

1263
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:59,920
cannot be too dense. And this means that

1264
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:03,560
very few A's are in are bad. So almost

1265
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,560
all are not bad.

1266
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,840
Well, the step just two

1267
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,640
two a bad

1268
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,640
and we get the contradiction.

1269
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:56,400
Okay, the first step is maybe the key

1270
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:58,480
step. So we are going to upgrade the

1271
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:01,760
second step to not just saying that a

1272
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:05,440
plus little a a is large but so what is

1273
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,960
a plus little a is pi a of a * a. So we

1274
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,520
are going to upgrade this to say that

1275
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,800
this is still true true if we pass to a

1276
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:16,800
dense subset of a * a. So first step

1277
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,560
if

1278
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:24,560
x is contained in a plus a and it is

1279
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:28,159
dense in the sense that the delta

1280
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:30,239
covering number doesn't okay so at some

1281
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:32,400
point there should be a parameter it

1282
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:34,640
completely ignoring maybe at this step

1283
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,640
we want something like it aa square

1284
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,640
dense

1285
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:47,080
then if we reject X, we still have

1286
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,080
growth

1287
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:54,239
and in fact at all scales or almost all

1288
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,000
scales. Maybe instead of epsilon the

1289
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:58,560
grow the growth will be epsilon over two

1290
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,360
but there will still be growth.

1291
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:04,080
So okay let me try to explain uh the

1292
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,719
first step in the last five minutes. So

1293
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,960
this is really as we will see the

1294
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,920
absolutely key step. We need to make

1295
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,080
this estimate in the second step robust

1296
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,800
and they're passing to then subsets and

1297
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,880
we will see maybe next time why this is

1298
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,080
what we really need to do in order to

1299
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,719
conclude what we want. Okay. So suppose

1300
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:28,280
that one is in a and this is just for

1301
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,280
notational simplicity.

1302
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,840
Okay. So there are two possibilities.

1303
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,840
One.

1304
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,840
Okay. So we want to show that there

1305
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,560
exist an a with this property. One a in

1306
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,560
a with this property.

1307
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,520
I guess step three should maybe be a

1308
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,679
later step. So or maybe we want to apply

1309
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,960
it at at many steps. So many steps we

1310
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,360
prove that something exists but once

1311
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,360
something exists actually almost all

1312
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,120
elements in a have this property. Okay

1313
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,800
let's say we want to prove that so at

1314
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:12,880
this stage we want to get one little a

1315
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,960
in a so that this is true. Okay so maybe

1316
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,840
we are lucky and the first thing we

1317
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:23,800
choose and let's call it one works well

1318
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,800
if it works it works. Okay so first case

1319
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,760
a equals one works.

1320
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,440
So it has this property.

1321
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,080
Well, if it works, it works. We are

1322
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,080
done. So let's assume that one doesn't

1323
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,080
work.

1324
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,640
What does it mean that a equals 1

1325
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:54,000
doesn't work? It means that there exists

1326
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:56,480
some x in a * a which has size

1327
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,199
bigger than delta to the ea square or

1328
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:05,159
something like this times the size of a

1329
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:05,159
time a but the projection is small

1330
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,960
okay uh we have to do this for every row

1331
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:13,040
but okay let's let's let's do it one row

1332
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,960
at a time and next time I will ex let's

1333
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:17,840
do it for delta next time I will explain

1334
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:20,480
how Why is true for for every delta in

1335
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,000
some sense?

1336
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,120
Okay, let's assume that for the

1337
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,520
particular scale delta there is no there

1338
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,520
is no growth.

1339
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,880
Well, this reminds you of what?

1340
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:39,080
So there is a theorem that you've seen

1341
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,080
before that this should remind you of.

1342
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,400
So we are projecting

1343
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,880
sorry and a is one actually a is one. So

1344
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:54,080
this is just the sum.

1345
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,600
So we are so if if one one is in a

1346
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,800
either it is good if it is good we have

1347
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,960
proved what we want because something is

1348
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,679
good or it's not good. If it's not good

1349
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:05,040
this is what it means by definition of

1350
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:09,040
not being good

1351
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:12,560
bsg. So this is exactly the assumption

1352
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:17,040
to apply value toic hours.

1353
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,199
So a has size delta to the minus s.

1354
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,440
Here we have a dense subset of the

1355
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:24,800
product set

1356
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:27,520
which has small partial subset. The pi 1

1357
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,120
image is small. It doesn't grow. So

1358
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:33,719
these are exactly the assumptions that

1359
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,719
we need to apply valuic hours.

1360
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:47,120
Okay. And I ran out of time. So uh so we

1361
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,320
are in the middle of the most important

1362
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:52,960
argument. So uh maybe on Tuesday, sorry,

1363
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:56,400
you will see me again. I will start with

1364
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,800
step four from the from the top. But

1365
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,560
maybe as an exercise you have five days,

1366
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,360
you can try to imagine how this will

1367
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,440
continue. So at least try to well just

1368
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,520
write down what is the outcome of aloxic

1369
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,960
hours and try to think how we can use

1370
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:13,600
that to eventually get what we want. At

1371
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:15,760
least this claim then I will explain how

1372
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:20,600
this claim together with uniformization

1373
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,600
lema allows us to conclude what we want.
