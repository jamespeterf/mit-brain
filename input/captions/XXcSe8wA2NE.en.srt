1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,279
first just to give you uh a quick

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,399
overview of the work that we're doing in

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,639
the MIT climate and sustainability

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,240
Consortium um we're a group of 14 member

5
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:14,360
companies that are from different

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,960
sectors who are working with each other

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,279
and the MIT Community to try to rapidly

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,560
scale climate and sustainability

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,119
Solutions uh and so our members are from

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,800
a variety of different sectors ex

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,720
centure uh Amazon Apple Cargill Dow

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,480
PepsiCo IBM Verizon

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,440
and we intentionally do that because we

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,000
listen to them about what are their

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
challenges when it comes to achieving

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,879
their climate and sustainability goals

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,000
um and then we help work with them on

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,920
ways that they can work with each other

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,239
and then also with the MIT Community to

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,359
co-create Solutions uh and just like you

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,000
heard from some of our former speakers

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,760
here we love to have industry working

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,680
with uh MIT researchers to help make

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,039
their work uh kind of more relevant

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,200
um and more likely to have impact and

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,880
then to be be able to be scaled so um

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,640
and the way in which we do our work we

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,080
identify a variety of different topics

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,360
uh on which um our members have set our

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,720
priorities and these range from things

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,479
like transportation to circularity

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,439
climate Finance nature-based Solutions

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:29,119
Computing uh social dimensions and um

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,079
and then when when uh the work happens

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,360
through uh a variety of different means

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,479
one is that we invest in um seed Awards

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,040
to the MIT Community these are are

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
faculty and graduate students and

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,000
postdocs who we invest to work on

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,119
projects with our member companies and

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,640
the other way is that we fund uh

42
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,479
postdoctoral impact fellows um and they

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,600
are experts in one of those areas and

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,680
their their job is to understand the

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,280
landscape at our member companies on

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,520
these topics and then also um within the

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,200
MIT Community to try to help make those

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,079
uh connection so um so today we're going

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,719
to hear from three uh posts here at MIT

50
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,920
two of who are mcsc impact fellows and

51
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,000
another who's working on a topic uh

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,720
that's still very relevant to climate

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,680
and Computing in particular um and we're

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,879
going to hear about the work uh that

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,519
they're they're doing uh and then I'll

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,239
come to close at the end so um our first

57
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,480
presenter is Dr Nan Basher and he is a

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,080
mcsc impact fellow working uh on

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,400
Computing and he'll talk about how

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,760
that's both the

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,480
impacts of computing how we decarbonize

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,000
that while also um trying to determine

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,760
solutions that Computing can help to

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,760
create so thanks very much no

65
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:52,760
[Applause]

66
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,760
one just one second

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,840
hi everyone um I am Nan Basher I am the

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,720
Computing and climate impact fellow at M

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,720
CSC uh I also work with the sale group

70
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,720
with Christina deletro in mitc sale I'm

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,280
a computer systems researcher by

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,680
training and today I'm going to talk

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,440
about the climate and sustainability

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,480
implications of generative

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,840
AI so there has been a lot of talk about

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,239
how AI Data Center need a lot of power

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,680
and that is true here we have a graph

78
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,640
where power demand is on y- AIS and

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,280
different quarters are of like recent

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,680
years are on x-axis we see that uh

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,599
before pandemic the demand was growing

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,079
but slowly during pandemic it kind of

83
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,239
slowed down but since um the

84
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,640
introduction of generative AI tools it

85
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
has

86
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,640
skyrocketed and if these numbers are

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,959
like for North American data centers and

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,680
this is the capacity for data centers

89
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,360
that is already under construction and

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:16,000
not the one that are being requested or

91
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,320
the even the ones that are um um being

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,759
basically operated right now so let's

93
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
take a look at the numbers from a

94
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,400
different perspective if you look at a

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,720
more uh global scale and particular to

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,360
um hyperscaler companies like Google

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,440
Microsoft uh they have massive projects

98
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,360
going on uh throughout the world and you

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,360
have these like uh 2,000 megawatt of

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,880
capacity just in Sweden and Norway for

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,440
Google alone and while these are more

102
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,120
region specific and Company specific

103
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,800
numbers here is uh a high level trend of

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,080
ICT industry at the global scale if you

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,120
see and if you look at these numbers

106
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,400
from 2005 to 2018

107
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,759
the demand kind of remained constant

108
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,520
like from 2010 to 18 it only increased

109
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,320
by 6% and the reason was that there were

110
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,479
these massive efficiency gains in

111
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,479
computer systems Hardware became

112
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,960
efficient people moved from uh on premus

113
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,479
data centers that are typically

114
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,720
inefficient to these cloud data centers

115
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,360
which are much more efficient so that

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,280
curbed that demand but all of those

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,600
efficiency gains have physical limits

118
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,039
and we are approaching those limits and

119
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,960
at the same time we have this

120
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:40,199
exponential increase in demand and it is

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,000
projected that by 2026 our demand will

122
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,880
go

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,759
from

124
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,840
2,200 terawatt in 2018 to almost 1,000

125
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,960
terawatt and beyond that any prediction

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,000
is uh mute because like you cannot

127
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,080
really um predict what is going to

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,440
happen Beyond like one or two years

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,479
so to understand this problem what is

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,680
going on we um I worked with um this

131
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,520
amazing set of researchers uh across MIT

132
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,880
on understanding what is driving this

133
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,639
growth and what are the implication and

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,759
how can we uh support a more responsible

135
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,960
development in generative

136
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:27,039
AI so for that basically uh we set out

137
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,520
to understand what are the key drivers

138
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,520
uh behind this growth so there is is

139
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,639
like in paper we outline like more uh

140
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,479
detailed drivers such as gains in Energy

141
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,199
Efficiency computer became cheaper

142
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,919
training bigger models became easier

143
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,840
there is this consolidation of AI

144
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:48,680
capabilities there is this perceived

145
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,680
benefit and so on but I think the major

146
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,319
uh driver has been this incomplete

147
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,800
consideration of value where people just

148
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,680
look at what AI is going to do for their

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,800
business and uh themselves and how

150
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,400
transform ative it is going to be even

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,440
though it is just an expected value not

152
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,319
the realized value but they don't really

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,440
uh look at the not so bright side where

154
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,120
you don't consider the impact on climate

155
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,520
or on people that don't have a vice on

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,919
this table uh that is discussing the

157
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,240
growth in

158
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,919
AI so what should we do about it so we

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,400
proposed in that paper that we we should

160
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,800
have a framework for assessing the

161
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,840
benefits and costs of generative AI

162
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,879
Technologies to inform or enable

163
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,919
stakeholders and decision makers to

164
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:47,919
decide okay is this a valuable

165
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:50,319
application of generative AI or not

166
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,759
rather than applying it to anywhere and

167
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,120
everywhere and it requires estimating

168
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,159
costs and benefits and requires

169
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,720
multi-stakeholder engagement and an an

170
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,879
ex example I show this like tradeoff

171
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,080
metrix for example that you have

172
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:11,400
societal benefits to be gained from um

173
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,680
generative Ai and then there are climate

174
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,759
impacts and total emission impacts so if

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,400
you for example make um some Energy

176
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,360
Efficiency improvements and the energy

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,120
per task goes down but the total

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,360
emissions Jon Paradox and all would

179
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,200
probably go up having um big Tech

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,919
control the generative AI makes it

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
probably more accessible just like

182
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:42,399
Google search was to a lot more people

183
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:46,519
but it may also restrict or resist to

184
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:50,920
regulation and uh other form of um

185
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:54,519
measures that enable a more sustainable

186
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,000
development so with this we call for

187
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,000
like people who are stakeholders

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,680
including policy makers Civil Society

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,279
uh computer scientists like myself and

190
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,240
uh other uh any other stakeholders to

191
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,519
come and decide okay how are the

192
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,360
decisions currently being made what do

193
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,160
they need um to make better

194
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,120
decisions and how can

195
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,320
we populate this framework that we are

196
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,800
talking about of benefits and cost to

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,839
enable those decision makings and for

198
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,959
that I set out to do my part which is I

199
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,760
am a computer systems person so my what

200
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:40,760
I do is that sense what is the impact of

201
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,560
computing figure out how to reduce it

202
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,480
and then develop systems that deploy

203
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,200
those optimization at scale and for this

204
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,440
talk I wanted to list out or map out

205
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,720
basically all the costs that are

206
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,200
important but things got very

207
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,120
complicated very quickly and I stopped

208
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,720
so this is not a complete picture this

209
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,519
is probably not even an accurate picture

210
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,200
but this just shows you that the when it

211
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,839
comes to just quantifying the cost of

212
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,839
like materials carbon water energy and

213
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,800
any other kind of like uh metrics that

214
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,440
may use to quantify environmental or

215
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,880
social or any other kind of costs there

216
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,600
are so many angles and variables and the

217
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,240
major problem in most of these uh

218
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,480
efforts is the lack of data for example

219
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,279
if I want to quantify how much um and

220
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,959
for gpt3 training took or like the most

221
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,839
advanced GPT 4 or something what it took

222
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,839
I may have an estimate of onetime

223
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,720
training for that cost but I don't know

224
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,639
the development effort that went into

225
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,760
training that model or how they are

226
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,959
regularly fine-tuning that model how

227
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,720
much is the Environmental cost on that

228
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,880
so a lot of things are hidden behind

229
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,320
these uh proprietary

230
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,959
um like controls and even if some of the

231
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,240
data about environmental impacts is

232
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,920
available it's uh in the basically

233
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,000
behind pay walls that may not be

234
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,279
accessible to researchers so given that

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,440
um I am just like saying uh in in terms

236
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,959
of this that before we go on uh

237
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,920
developing uh framework we need to

238
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,720
estimate these costs well and for that

239
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,760
uh broader

240
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,639
engagement from industry stakeholders

241
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,560
would be helpful in terms of informing

242
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,040
us where the costs are coming from and

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,200
how we are going to um um better

244
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,160
quantify them and what do they need in

245
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,399
terms of U decision making from our side

246
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,120
and with that I will conclude my talk

247
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,450
and at the end of the session I will be

248
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:59,159
happy to take us

249
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,159
[Applause]

250
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,240
all right thank you noan um our next

251
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,160
speaker is Dr Bjorn lutan and he is a

252
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,920
post-doctoral associate in Earth

253
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,200
atmosphere and planetary Sciences

254
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,959
department and he's working on a project

255
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,839
that's actually um one of mit's climate

256
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,880
Grand Challenge Flagship projects called

257
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,800
bringing uh Computing to The Climate

258
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,240
challenge I know it's bc3 I always I

259
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,519
remember which order the CES are um but

260
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,639
which is a really neat way that he'll

261
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,920
talk about to make a digital PL twin of

262
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,920
our um of the climate and one of the

263
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,360
neat things is that this is not an mcsc

264
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,720
project per se but we have set up

265
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,720
discussions between researchers on his

266
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,839
team and some of our member companies

267
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,199
from insurance and Computing sectors to

268
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,959
figure out how is it that we can apply

269
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,560
what they're doing to support decision

270
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,480
making so we'll be curious for your

271
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,480
feedback on that too so beorn please

272
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,629
[Applause]

273
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,560
okay hello everybody so I will be

274
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,639
sharing with you sort of a research

275
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,199
exert from our bc3 team which we label a

276
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,760
cautionary Tale on deep learning climate

277
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:24,320
emulators and climate

278
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,560
emulators um in a nutshell are we have a

279
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,199
very computation expensive um climate

280
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,800
model that has created a large data set

281
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,320
and now we want to find fast

282
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,320
approximations to that why would we want

283
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,120
to do this right now um some of you

284
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,560
might have heard of the CIP assemble or

285
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,240
SSP scenarios um these are assumptions

286
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,839
on co2 methane emissions black carbon

287
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,680
sufur dioxide um basically assumptions

288
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:54,839
on how they could um behave in the

289
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,680
future so there's a business as usual

290
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,360
scenario um there's a negative carbon

291
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,920
emission scenario the green one the SSP

292
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,759
126 basically internationally we have

293
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
agreed on four to five of those

294
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,079
scenarios that are the most important

295
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,519
scenarios to explore with the climate

296
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:17,240
models that um International climate

297
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,839
modeling centers have developed

298
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,079
so researchers around the world ran

299
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,160
their climate model there's about around

300
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,800
about a 100 climate models uh in the

301
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,639
world for these scenarios and that gives

302
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,160
us the body of um global temperature

303
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,480
predictions or

304
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,000
precipitation um projections uh for 2030

305
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,079
2050 ahead the issue with that approach

306
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,759
is that every time you run a climate

307
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,600
model it takes about two weeks on 20,000

308
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,519
CPUs that's the equivalent of hundreds

309
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,839
of thousands of dollars just in the

310
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,519
compute cost to run a single climate

311
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,519
model for a single scenario so that's

312
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,320
why we only have five scenarios and that

313
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,720
what makes it really hard for example to

314
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,480
find out um let's think about

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,600
uh what would be the impacts of uh

316
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,800
nature-based Solutions increasing

317
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,639
Wetlands we would have to ask our friend

318
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,600
at the climate Computing Center to run

319
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,160
their model uh spend $400,000 on compute

320
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,160
to really find that out so what if we

321
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,639
can take all the data we have created

322
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,120
and find fast approximations to that and

323
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,399
that is sort of the goal of this bc3

324
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,360
team and today we'll explore one

325
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:30,600
particular research paper out of that so

326
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,319
um these climate emulators some of them

327
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,199
exist already I want to point out mit's

328
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,920
model called nroads where um you can

329
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,480
explore sort of the impact of what if we

330
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,440
dramatically curb deforestation reduce

331
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,079
it and how would that impact Global

332
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,079
temperature change this model is really

333
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,800
great it can run on your your your

334
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
laptop after the session you can Google

335
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,360
nroads but what it cannot really give

336
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,920
you yet is local impacts they're working

337
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,519
on that um but that is one of the big

338
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,480
challenges of these climate emulators so

339
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,560
how do we emulate the effect of climate

340
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,240
policies onto local climate impacts for

341
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,040
that we need to understand that earth's

342
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,120
climate is a chaotic system so let's

343
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,759
take for example one of these scenarios

344
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:19,279
the SSP um 245 and we run one climate

345
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,279
model and then we take the average of

346
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,839
the temperature that the climate model

347
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,000
predicts we average that over every year

348
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,720
and

349
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,199
a we average that over every year and um

350
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
over over the full globe and that gives

351
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,360
us the global temperature change so here

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,199
you can see the global temperature

353
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:42,839
change uh might be might be 2.5

354
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:44,519
degrees um and um now what you can see

355
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,399
though are these Wiggles in here and

356
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,880
these Wiggles are interannual

357
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,600
oscillation things like elino mjo um

358
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,639
these are unpredictable they're chaotic

359
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,959
um so if in fact if we run the model

360
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,160
again here we run it five times more in

361
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,920
black and you can see every time these

362
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,439
are at completely different locations so

363
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,400
climate emulation climate modeling

364
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,919
becomes a a a statistical problem where

365
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,880
it's more important to think about the

366
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,079
means and the standard deviations rather

367
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,520
than the exact trajectory so if we run

368
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,280
this 50 times then we can really see

369
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,280
very nicely this mean temperature uh

370
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,199
Trend increasing and we can even see

371
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,640
things like uh this this this like here

372
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,559
that was a volcano eruption that put out

373
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,200
a lot of sulfur dioxide so 50

374
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,679
realization uh the more realizations the

375
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,960
better we can understand the climate

376
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,440
mean so now we want to think about how

377
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,520
can we approximate this data with a

378
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,520
machine learning model so that we can

379
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,200
for example train the model on three of

380
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,799
these scenarios and then validate it on

381
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,240
the fourth one in the middle and then

382
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,960
test it on sort of all scenarios in

383
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,520
between that one could

384
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,320
imagine so for that in machine learning

385
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,840
often the first way is to create a what

386
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,679
we call a benchmark which gives us a

387
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,919
standardized data set and metrics where

388
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,480
scientists agree on uh so that if one

389
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,320
method is better on the metrics that are

390
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,640
in this Benchmark then that means it is

391
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,440
a better method so one of those

392
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,679
benchmarks exists it's called the

393
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,200
climate bench version um 1.0 and in this

394
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,360
case uh they have again these five

395
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,760
emission Pathways they ran one climate

396
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,799
model called the nor esm model three

397
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,039
times per emission pathway and then the

398
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,159
they were only able to run it three

399
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,960
times and we will find out later why

400
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,480
that was an issue um and then the the

401
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,200
target of the machine learning model is

402
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
to predict the assemble mean

403
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,080
particularly the Machine model is tasked

404
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,280
given maps of black carbon and maps of

405
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,120
uh surfur dioxide and Global cumulative

406
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,440
CO2 emissions and methane emissions um

407
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,280
of let's say the year

408
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,320
2050 the target then becomes given these

409
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,480
four input uh data points to predict the

410
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,080
temperature change annually averaged

411
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,640
over the year

412
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,080
2050 and currently deep learning methods

413
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,000
are being cited as the best models on

414
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,280
the stand Benchmark so I think there's a

415
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,919
lot of excitement uh we need bigger

416
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,919
machine learning models um to be better

417
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,600
but in in in our work we took maybe one

418
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,000
two three steps back and said what if we

419
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,000
do this with linear regression so we fit

420
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,640
one linear regression model that is the

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,760
easiest possible it just takes

422
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,080
cumulative CO2 emission as input

423
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,480
ignoring methane uh black carbon and

424
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,320
sulfur dioxide and predicting what is

425
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,280
the global temperature that's that's two

426
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,480
parameters that we're fitting there and

427
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,200
then from the global temperature we fit

428
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,320
one um one linear regression model per

429
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,200
grid cell to focus the local temperature

430
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,880
given the global temperature and in fact

431
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:56,559
now if we have um the full table sort of

432
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,880
across climate variables and then across

433
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,280
models we can see that the best model so

434
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,320
far which is we call it a foundation

435
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,799
model that has 100 million parameters

436
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,360
and has similar technology what's behind

437
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:12,000
an llm that you can use so their model

438
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,120
had some score some error and then the

439
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,520
linear regression model had actually

440
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,840
lower score had a better score on

441
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,679
surface temperature precipitation and on

442
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,720
precipitation so we were quite shocked

443
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,080
by that why would this linear regression

444
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,320
model be better than the 100 million

445
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,679
parameter model for for these variables

446
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,640
you want to find that out why would it

447
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,760
be so good and actually and there we

448
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:40,559
realized well we realized that it is

449
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,799
already for a long time known that um

450
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,679
cumulative CO2 has a linear relationship

451
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:47,840
with the global temperature increase

452
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,120
which is kind of ironic you ran these

453
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,760
like incredibly complex Earth system

454
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,640
models uh into the future but what comes

455
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,039
out is a linear relationship with global

456
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,400
cumulative CO2 and Global temperature

457
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,200
but even more more than that actually

458
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,919
the local temperature change also is a

459
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,159
linear function of the global

460
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,600
temperature change so that is cool and

461
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:11,440
the linear regression model was able to

462
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,559
exploit that um to do these relatively

463
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,240
pretty good predictions but in

464
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,200
precipitation it was more complex the

465
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,159
precip the linear agression model also

466
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,919
was pretty good for precipitation but

467
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,480
the relationship of global surface

468
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,080
temperature with respect to local

469
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,200
precipitation had much more much more

470
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,039
complex much more noise in it so why

471
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,240
would this also be better and here the

472
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,440
story is because it was only three

473
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,000
realizations in the Benchmark so for

474
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,919
example here we plot the blue line is

475
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,559
the is the precipitation change in

476
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,000
southern Central America as modeled if

477
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,400
you just average over three realizations

478
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,120
and we realize that's too much noise no

479
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,360
model can sort of see the trend there

480
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,520
except for the linear regression model

481
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,640
uh that just says okay the trend sort of

482
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,720
goes slightly down um but the Deep

483
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,320
learning model would overfit on these

484
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,200
very strong Wiggles and try to forecast

485
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,159
the exact trajectory even though that

486
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,360
was not possible due to the chaotic

487
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,559
system but if we then sort of repeat

488
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,679
this Benchmark practice with 50 emble

489
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:19,039
members H then we can see that local

490
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,200
Trends are more um more visible in the

491
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,960
data can be better

492
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,720
learned um so you can see this also here

493
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,960
but I'm not going to go into that for

494
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,400
that um I'll point you to a discussion

495
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,720
with me or reading the paper uh the

496
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,679
takeaway is linear regression could

497
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,159
outperform this large scale deep

498
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,679
learning model uh on the standard

499
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,039
Benchmark in the

500
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,240
community which pointed out that linear

501
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:45,919
regression works really well for

502
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,559
temperature but for precipitation uh we

503
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
had to update the Benchmark because

504
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,960
there was too much noise in the

505
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,720
Benchmark

506
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,960
targets and addressing this noise was

507
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
really necessary so that now we have a

508
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,240
more robust assessment on how can we

509
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,440
make progress in climate emulation

510
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,120
techniques and we are on the on on the

511
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,840
path of taking this linear method for

512
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,080
surface temperature integrating it into

513
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,480
on roads so that people can play with it

514
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,679
explore the local temperature change um

515
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,720
but also in the context of this

516
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,720
presentation we are on the look now for

517
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,640
more complex climate variables if you

518
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,679
have a climate variable that you in

519
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,400
particular are very interested in uh

520
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,250
then I'd be happy to talk about how to

521
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,559
emulate that thank you very much

522
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,559
[Applause]

523
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,679
thank you so much beorn um as I said you

524
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,600
know what I love about that project is

525
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,320
they're taking some really complicated

526
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,279
things and uh thinking about how to make

527
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,240
them more accessible and now you know

528
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,000
the question is for many people like you

529
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,760
what would you do with that information

530
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,480
that typically was only accessible to

531
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,679
you know government policy makers or

532
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,400
academics uh you know kind of turns over

533
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,919
a whole new Leaf so um last but not

534
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,480
least in this session we have Dr Danica

535
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,000
McDonald who's a um mcsc impact fellow

536
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,520
in our transportation area and she's

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
going to talk about some work that she's

538
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,559
doing uh related to trucking

539
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,559
decarbonization that was very much

540
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,799
motivated by uh the challenges of mcsc

541
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,520
members and she connected their needs

542
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,360
with a lot of expertise that's going on

543
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,799
here at MIT and of course a lot of her

544
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,360
own skills and capabilities as well so

545
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,360
Danica please come on up

546
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,480
everyone now that you've seen the whole

547
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,240
presentation um so I'm I'm going to be

548
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,600
talking about a geospatial tool that

549
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,320
we've been developing here at the mcsc

550
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,320
to support uh Trucking Fleet

551
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,000
decarbonization

552
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,840
sorry um okay so I'm going to start by

553
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,200
just quickly uh motivating why we're

554
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:04,600
focusing this tool on uh the TR Trucking

555
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:07,320
sector so even though um this uh this

556
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,480
even though trucks only make up about 5%

557
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,840
of on-road vehicles they produce just

558
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,039
under a quarter of all greenhouse gas

559
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,679
emissions in the

560
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:21,840
US um so the trucking industry itself is

561
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,640
under um very um increasing regulatory

562
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,360
pressure to um decarbonize its

563
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,520
operations and it's um very difficult

564
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:33,200
for Fleet owners to actually make this

565
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,520
transition for a few reasons first the

566
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,720
industry operates under very tight

567
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,360
profit margins and this can make it

568
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,360
really difficult um for Fleet owners to

569
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,840
make these high-risk Investments that

570
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,000
are needed um to decarbonize their

571
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,480
fleets um another thing is that these

572
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,799
fleets tend to operate on very strict

573
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,760
delivery schedules and that makes it

574
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,799
very difficult um to make any um

575
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,919
significant changes that would

576
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,600
um that would drastically modify how the

577
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,559
fleet operates and then lastly a lot of

578
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,159
these fleets are very reliant on um

579
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,200
energy dense fuels like diesel to carry

580
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:15,399
these superheavy payloads over very long

581
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,720
distances um so there's a lot of

582
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:21,279
different um energy carriers that are

583
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,840
emerging that have potential to help the

584
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,640
trucking industry reduce its emissions

585
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,760
and um different carriers seem to be um

586
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,159
better Suited for different sort of

587
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,480
segments of the industry there's also a

588
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,559
lot of different public data sets out

589
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,840
there that um can support fleets in

590
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,520
navigating this transition to

591
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,520
alternative energy carriers so the goal

592
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:50,600
of this tool is to compile all of this

593
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:54,799
data into one um interactive tool that

594
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:57,760
can um support fleets in navigating

595
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,480
this so I'm just going to start by

596
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,480
actually demoing the tool so you can get

597
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,919
a sense of what it looks like um so it

598
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,279
lives on the mcc's data Hub website and

599
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,399
from there you can go into the tool and

600
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,840
um bring up different data layers so

601
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:17,080
this one is a total cost of truck

602
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,640
ownership and you can change details

603
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,640
like uh looking at the cost premium or

604
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,880
changing like um aspects of how the

605
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,039
truck actually

606
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,480
operates um and then you can also

607
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:31,000
overlay different infrastructure layers

608
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,640
like Highway flows or um hydrogen

609
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,240
electrolyzers to customize um the

610
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,240
transition

611
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,519
assessment so the development of this

612
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,799
tool actually ended up following a

613
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:48,320
pretty regular cycle between stakeholder

614
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:50,640
engagement and um and focus development

615
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,360
so a lot as as jerem mentioned a lot of

616
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,320
the early motivation for this tool

617
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:59,000
actually came from a study group that

618
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,760
the mcsc hosted last June where

619
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,760
um a lot of the feedback emphasized a

620
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,840
need for um dedicated tools to be able

621
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:14,600
to support fleets in um understanding

622
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,240
how like when where and how to um to

623
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,919
make these early Investments for Fleet

624
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,080
transition so over the next few months I

625
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,159
started prototyping this tool initially

626
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,120
in qgis and then shifting over to a

627
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,799
custom open source framework based on

628
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,519
open layers

629
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:36,799
and then uh late last year

630
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:39,240
oops sorry and then late last year um I

631
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,559
uh engaged different stakeholders across

632
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,360
the trucking industry both mcsc partner

633
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:49,080
companies and um and non non-mcc members

634
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,880
to uh demo the tool and ask their for

635
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,320
their feedback on how we could um

636
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,480
improve this tool and make it more uh

637
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,600
relevant to their actual decision-making

638
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,360
process and um what this feedback

639
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,480
actually highlighted was that we needed

640
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,600
to go back and and develop some clear

641
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,240
case studies to demonstrate to users how

642
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,720
they could actually work with this tool

643
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,559
and um use it to support um their

644
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,440
decision- making so um over the next few

645
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,000
months I worked with an undergraduate

646
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,320
researcher to develop these case studies

647
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and shared them as blog posts and videos

648
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,840
um and then uh this past June we shared

649
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,559
these case studies with uh six mcsc

650
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,039
partner companies at an outcome workshop

651
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,000
and what the um feedback from this

652
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,480
outcome Workshop highlighted was

653
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,559
actually a lot of um alignment around

654
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,200
two major points the first is that users

655
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,080
need to be able to explore the data

656
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,440
that's actually underlying these these

657
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,919
features that they're looking at on the

658
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:58,039
tool and the second is that um users

659
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,159
need to be able to um overlay their own

660
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:02,320
own private data on top of all these

661
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,240
public layers so that they can do a more

662
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,640
customized assessment that's relevant to

663
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,279
their Fleet and their

664
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,640
operations so over the summer we've

665
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,080
implemented a click feature that allows

666
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,000
users to do this exploration into the

667
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,279
underlying data and I'm also working

668
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,399
with a wonderful programmer to um allow

669
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,600
users to securely upload their private

670
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,440
data to the mcc's data Hub website so

671
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,200
that they can then do this overlay and

672
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:36,039
um and see their own data on on the

673
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,000
tool um so moving ahead uh in starting

674
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:40,919
early next year my goal is to then go

675
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,399
back to um demonstrating this tool to

676
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,360
stakeholders and hopefully identifying

677
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,760
some Partners who are interested in

678
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,120
piloting the tool for their own

679
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,440
transition

680
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,480
assessment um so I also want to

681
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,399
highlight some of the ways that we've

682
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,760
been able to engage other MIT

683
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,000
researchers in the process of developing

684
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,120
this tool um so the total cost of

685
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,519
ownership layer that I showed in the

686
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,480
demo was actually adopted from a um an

687
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,480
electrified Trucking model that was

688
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,840
developed by Karana and cheyen deep two

689
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,919
grad students in Prof Bill greens uh

690
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,960
chemical engineering group so earlier

691
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,639
this year I worked with uh these grad

692
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:27,720
students to adapt their model over um to

693
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,440
the to Pilot data from the Tesla semi

694
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,840
and then um modify it so that it could

695
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,880
um work within within the

696
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,880
tool we've also been super fortunate to

697
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,480
have some really um incredible

698
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,480
contributions to the tool from

699
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,000
undergraduate researchers through mit's

700
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,840
year op program um so Micah our first um

701
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,600
student working on this project

702
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,639
developed a novel algorithm to be able

703
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,679
to um compare transition potential

704
00:31:53,639 --> 00:32:00,080
between different uh Trucking

705
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,720
corridors and then Helena uh worked with

706
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,000
us to develop these case studies to

707
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,440
demonstrate to different stakeholders

708
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,360
how they could engage with the tool and

709
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,760
um and use it for their transition

710
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,720
planning and then Brooke worked with us

711
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,360
over the summer to implement this uh

712
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,440
click feature that allows users to dig

713
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,679
into um data underlying these geospatial

714
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:27,559
layers um so the last thing I want to

715
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,159
just talk a bit about is um the emphasis

716
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,840
that we placed on transparency and

717
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,480
adaptability throughout the tools

718
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,440
development so the goal um here is

719
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,399
basically just to make the tool as

720
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,960
widely usable as possible so all of the

721
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:46,000
source code that underlies the tool is

722
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,159
um hosted on public GitHub repositories

723
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,240
the data that the tool pulls from is uh

724
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:53,960
is published on zenodo so anyone can

725
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,600
download it and adapt it for their own

726
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,320
uh research and we've also made it so

727
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,240
that that's super duper easy for anyone

728
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,000
to download the tool onto their own

729
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,919
computer and bring it up and um develop

730
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,840
with it and make changes so I guess like

731
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,159
looking ahead My ultimate goal for this

732
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,960
tool is really that as user start to

733
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,080
Pilot it and um use it for their own

734
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,519
decision- making that we can start to

735
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,760
develop a sustaining community of users

736
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,519
who are um proposing changes and

737
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,080
implementing new features to support

738
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,350
their own transition assessment so

739
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:36,799
that's that's all for me

740
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:39,240

741
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,000
thanks thank you so much Danica so I

742
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,519
think the theme um that we saw across

743
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,080
all three of these is that there's a lot

744
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,960
of great work that's happening here at

745
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,679
uh MIT but really you know our goal here

746
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,399
is to try to have impact right whether

747
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,120
that's moving the needle on climate or

748
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,360
anything else that we do and that's

749
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,399
where we really benefit from

750
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,519
interactions with industry to help us

751
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:01,519
figure fure out how do we pilot these

752
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,600
things to learn from your experiences

753
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,320
using them uh and then also something

754
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,200
that industry is very good at scaling

755
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,879
things uh and so how do you take many of

756
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,960
things that we're doing help to scale

757
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,359
them and so we'll be glad to do that

758
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,599

759
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,359
