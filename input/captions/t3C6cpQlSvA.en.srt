1
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,240
so okay so let's start so so I'm J and

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,519
uh uh so today I will give the lecture

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:27,359
about Starks for batch NP or batch

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:31,960
argument so uh okay so so this lecture

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,960
is about a bch argument um

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,039
and uh it has many different names such

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,239
as barks

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,520
so or you can also call it snarks for

9
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,520
batch

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,039
andp so um so B is are very basic

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
Concept in computer science so basically

12
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,479
if you have multiple items and you want

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,600
to collect them together then you can

14
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,280
call this collection a batch so uh there

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,360
are similar ideas in for example in

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,320
programming so there are concept like uh

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,040
batch processing and the so it's a very

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,880
uh common concept so in this lecture uh

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,159
we will talk about uh the batch argument

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,119
so it's it's a notion of batch in the

21
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,040
proof system

22
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,360
so uh firstly let me this uh Define what

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:43,000
is a b

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:48,560
argument so definition um so a bars a

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,560
bar is uh is a two of

26
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,240
algorithms

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,520
um so it consist of a uh generator and a

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,440
approver and a wifire

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,679
algorithm and uh with the following

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,800
syntax so at the very beginning the

31
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,519
generator will generate some CRS so it

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,599
will take some security parameter as

33
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,599
input and generate some

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,440
CRS and both of the approver and the

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,720
wifire is given access to This Ss

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,280
throughout of the pro of the

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,080
protocol so instead of proving one

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,680
statement time the batch proof allows

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,400
the prover to convince the verifier that

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,200
a batch of the statement is true so for

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:48,920
example uh so let's fix uh uh MP

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,920
language l so the L is uh Define as

43
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,560
follows and the prover tries to convince

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,840
the wif fire that uh a list of instance

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
from X1 to XK

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,400
so the pro has this list of statements

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,440
and he wants to convince the wifire that

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,040
all of those statements are in this this

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,040
MP language

50
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,720
l so this is the statement the prover

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,239
wants to convince the

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
wif and uh the proof is a single R

53
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,560
message

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,040
pip and also the prover also has the NP

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,599
winess for this uh uh X12 XK so let's

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,879
denote the NP witness as W12 WK so those

57
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,879
are the NP

58
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,879
witness

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,599
okay so now

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,560
um so as a so we say such a proof we say

61
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,040
such a bar is sync if it satisfies the

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,040
following

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,200
property so second is is defined as uh

64
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,439
the size of the proof is uh smaller than

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,640
the total length of the

66
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,640
widness so can anyone see why we require

67
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:20,519
this yes yes right exactly uh so we

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,880
require this this because uh a trivial a

69
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,840
trib uh proof system uh could we could

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,120
have the approver to just send off the

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,240
NP witness to the warier then the proess

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,400
will be K times w

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,199
so second this require this and uh and

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,320
as any proof systems we require the

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,320
completeness and the soundness

76
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,320
so so completeness requir uh for any

77
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,240
only study generated proof it will

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,120
always be accepted and uh the

79
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,960
soundness okay and

80
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,960
the and the soundness is defined as

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,960
follows

82
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,600
so the S says uh if if the statement is

83
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,320
not true then any cheating prover

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:14,960
shouldn't find a cheating proof so it

85
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,960
means uh so so if this is not

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:30,000
true then for any uh nonuniform uh PBT

87
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
cheating improver we have the we have

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,440
this

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
property so we

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,199
require so the cheating Pro is uh given

91
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,080
the CRS send by the CRS generator and we

92
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,800
required to send a proof Pi star so Pi

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,720
star is the cheating proof and we

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,759
require the probability that the proof

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,759
is accepted by this wi fire is

96
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,759
negligible

97
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,680
so I guess you already learned about the

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,479
concept the definition of the proof

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,479
systems this just a recouple for the

100
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:23,120
definition so do we know uh so uh any

101
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,120
questions about this definition

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,880
so uh now some of you might wonder why

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
we care about such a proof system

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,639
because such proof system is clearly a

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,520
subass so such a statement is clearly a

106
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,560
subass of MP so why we care about them

107
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,479
so the so the reason is as suggest

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,199
mentioned so batch is a very basic

109
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,879
concept so this is a just a notion of

110
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,360
batch uh batch the notion of batch in

111
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,360
the proof systems and the similar

112
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,800
concept has been studied in other areas

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,960
in cryptography such as signatures so

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,400
there is a uh signature scheme called

115
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,440
aggregated Signature so it allows you to

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,680
aggregate multiple signatures together

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,039
to a short signature then you only need

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,360
to verify the short signature to ensure

119
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,479
all the signatures can be verified so so

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,360
there is

121
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,360
also a smilar notion uh studied in

122
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
interactive proofs and it's called a

123
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,360
batch interactive proof

124
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,360
and uh so such a such a bark also has

125
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,000
many applications uh so in the next

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,240
lecture so yo will tell you how to use

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,319
it to build snars for all

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
ofp and

129
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,960
uh uh in fact there are many

130
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,800
constructions of snars 4p up to now so

131
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,360
from various assumptions and uh uh there

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,479
are different construction but all of

133
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,440
those constructions are uses this spks

134
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:06,039
uh as a building block in it

135
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,639
and uh indeed yeah is sound or is that

136
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,080
possible uh that's a good question so

137
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,560
there's a reason work shows if you can

138
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,159
get

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,199
statistical uh so you can get statical

140
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,000
Parks then you can build some witness

141
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,000
some some statistical witness in

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,720
distinguishability yeah you can yeah so

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,680
we don't know the we don't know the

144
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,680
exact answer yet

145
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,599
uh and uh so and actually there is a

146
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,200
technical reason why we study such a

147
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,440
bark why we study bark so this is the I

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,039
will briefly mention it but I will not

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,640
go into detail of this uh lower Bond so

150
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,640
this is the work by gent and

151
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,080
weeks so they show that uh I will not

152
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,480
describe exactly the uh impossibility

153
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,000
result so they show some impossibility

154
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,720
result about snarks in general

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,600
so they show it is

156
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:11,120
a it is impossible to

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,120
uh impossible to build

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,959
a to build a snarks for uh any for any T

159
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,959
hard

160
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,959
language uh with proof size

161
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:37,959
uh significantly less than log T so so

162
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,399
what does it mean uh so so here we say

163
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,000
uh a language is T hard if it takes T

164
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,440
time to decide this language so for

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,210
example uh for General MP language with

166
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,320
uh winess lens W then

167
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,200
[Music]

168
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,120
um then usually you all take two to the

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,480
W time to decide this language so by

170
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,160
this uh impossibility result they they

171
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,240
are saying it is uh very hard to build

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,399
snarks for General MP language uh if the

173
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,519
proof size is uh significantly less than

174
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,839
W so basically snar 4 MP is very hard to

175
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,360
build and uh and here the impossibility

176
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,279
is only holds for very good assumptions

177
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,200
so they call they call those assumptions

178
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,600
falsifiable assumption and basically uh

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,120
good assumptions such as uh learning

180
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:30,680
with arrow assumption are foral viable

181
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,920
so so I want to mention this because

182
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,120
um uh indeed if you want to so if we

183
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,959
consider barks then the language we are

184
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,519
then the this language the language we

185
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,519
are proving

186
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:47,959
sorry so if we want to consider barks

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,000
then the language we are proving is the

188
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:54,320
following language indeed so the

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,760
language Pro tries to convin verifier is

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,279
the language L uh product K times so it

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,600
simply of all of X1 to

192
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:10,279
XK such that all of X1 to

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,399
XK is in this language l so so what's

194
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:17,200
the time to decide this

195
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,200
language uh do anyone

196
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:28,839
else St yes yes right right uh great so

197
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,160
that's correct so to decide this

198
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:35,920
language we only need to uh take K * 2

199
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,519
to the W because you only need to uh

200
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,360
decide whether each XI is in L or not

201
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,639
and if one of them is not in L then you

202
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,720
then you know this language you know

203
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:50,040
this instance is not in this language

204
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,320
so so the point is if you take a if you

205
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,320
take this T in inside this uh into this

206
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,600
G WIS impossibility it shows that it is

207
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,279
very hard to build snar for H proof size

208
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:08,160
significantly less than log T but log T

209
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,800
is uh uh is roughly roughly the size of

210
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,440
w

211
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,279
so so it only shows is is very hard to

212
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,040
build a snark for proof that

213
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:22,320
significantly less than W but this is

214
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,040
signicantly enough so I mean if we can

215
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,399
build a snar with uh if we can build a

216
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,399
box for with proof size W it doesn't

217
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,399
contradict to into X but it is still

218
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,120
succinct because W is already uh

219
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,600
significantly less than K *

220
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
W okay uh any

221
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:51,240
questions okay so in this lecture uh the

222
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,240
main the we want to prove is the is the

223
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,120
following so there exist a contstruction

224
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,120
of bars

225
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,320
uh for learning with

226
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,320
arrow and uh the proof size is

227
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,800
uh

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,079
yeah so the proof size is

229
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,079
a part of uh sorry

230
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,000
so the proof size is dominated by

231
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,600
the the proof size is dominated by the

232
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,120
uh circuit the relation circuit size so

233
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,279
roughly you can think uh if we consider

234
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:52,519
3 sat8 instance then almost this uh this

235
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:56,399
C is almost the same as the lens of w

236
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:59,920
because the circuit is shallow yeah and

237
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,279
the and the verification time

238
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,639
so uh right so so the proof size is

239
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:09,040
almost uh close to the close to this W

240
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,120
because the log K term is small yeah and

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,120
the verification time

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,240
is

243
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,399
yeah so the verification time is K times

244
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:30,320
uh one of the instance

245
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,600
uh and uh plus some addition term so the

246
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,880
additional term so the first term only

247
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,440
depends on the total length of the

248
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,320
instance so which is K time

249
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,199
x so because we have K instances and

250
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,120
each of each of the instance has l

251
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,000
x so the additional term doesn't depends

252
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,120
on the uh instant side the total length

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,600
of the instant size so it only depends

254
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,600
on log

255
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:01,000
K uh the size of c and the Lambda

256
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,480
yeah so so the uh so in fact there are

257
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,600
more structure about the wifire

258
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,839
algorithm so in uh the wifire the

259
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,560
verification algorithm can be decomposed

260
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,600
to two parts the first part will only

261
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,440
take the all of the instance as input

262
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,160
and pre-processing it to Output some

263
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,480
very small state then the uh so after

264
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,839
the pre-processing the online phase will

265
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,199
take the state from the pre-processing

266
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,680
algorithm and it will verify the pro in

267
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,360
a very short time so the online phase

268
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,519
doesn't depends on the it doesn't depend

269
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,920
on

270
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:43,399
K I will come to this point

271
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,399
later so this is the m Ser I want to

272
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,839
prove uh so next yeah

273
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,240
sorry the number of lines the

274
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,319
of of yeah so you want

275
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,480
to K so K

276
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:23,720
much it's K much ler

277
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:28,000
than uh lens of oh right so K is you can

278
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,920
think K is a is a polinomial in W yeah

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,120
usually yeah because you want the pro to

280
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,880
be a polom algorithm then you can only

281
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,880
consider polinomial K

282
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:45,079
so so Pol W then this construction is

283
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:48,120
only exct if like the Pol in C is

284
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:52,399
small uh right yes

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,319
yeah uh right so in fact there is a so

286
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,600
there is a way to generically put of

287
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,720
strength this to uh remove the

288
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,519
dependence on the S on the size of the

289
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,000
circuit to make it even smaller to make

290
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,880
it only depends on the winess size and

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,360
so but that we I use the uh the things

292
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,360
in the next lecture by so you can

293
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,199
yeah okay so any

294
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,760
questions okay so uh so next I will show

295
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,280
you

296
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,280
how to construct this

297
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,640
bars uh so the if I directly show you

298
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,960
the construction it will be very

299
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,200
complicated so I will show you uh a

300
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,240
first initial attempt to do the

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,280
construction and gradually added the

302
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,360
building blocks to the construction

303
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,760
okay so the so our starting point is the

304
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,840
Kens protocal uh actually it's a

305
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,840
simplified version of K

306
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,080
so so initially uh the prover so the

307
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:28,840
prover has uh

308
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,240
K so it has a k instance and winess so

309
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,320
W1 to

310
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:39,159
WK sorry X1 to

311
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:42,679
XK and uh the pro is going to use uh PCP

312
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:47,080
to generate the PCP for all of those uh

313
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,640
uh for all of those uh instance so he

314
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,720
applied the PCP Pro algorithm to it and

315
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,120
obtain a PCP proof which is a long

316
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,799
stram so this is the first uh first PCP

317
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,880
proof for X1 and W1 uh and he does the

318
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:08,159
same for the second instance and witness

319
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,159
server so

320
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,159
PCP so do do any of you remember what is

321
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,159
PC key

322
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,480
uh or do I need to recall

323
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:33,039
it okay so so PCP is a

324
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:35,080
so a quick uh quick recall what is PCP

325
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,200
so PCP is

326
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,200
uh so

327
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
PCP

328
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:49,760
um so uh let's see PCP uh for

329
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,679
NP so PCP for NP is a pair of algorithm

330
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,159
uh so the prover so the prover has some

331
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:59,200
X and W which is the MP instance and

332
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,440
witness and he can uh generate long

333
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,159
proof long PCP

334
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,919
proof and the so this is the pro

335
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:12,320
algorithm for PCP and there is a PCP

336
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:14,720
wire fire so the wire fire will read uh

337
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,240
so this PCP string is some binary string

338
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,159
so it contains zero and on and the Wii

339
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:25,400
will sample some uh random coordinates Q

340
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:30,640
so the let's say the size of the PCP is

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,640
L and the Q is a subet of indices

342
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:42,559
so the so the uh PCP wifer will

343
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,559
check uh it will take

344
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,400
the uh the instance X and the query

345
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:53,840
queue and the PCP uh in the in the

346
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:57,840
subset queue and to where to and then it

347
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,760
uh decides to accept or reject okay so

348
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,120
that's the PCP

349
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,840
and uh we require the uh so the complain

350
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,720
says if x and W is in the language then

351
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,679
the proof should be accepted by the Wii

352
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,679
and the sound n

353
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:23,360
says so the sound says um so for any X

354
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:28,240
so if X is not in L then uh for

355
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,240
any so for any PCP string uh PCP PCP

356
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,600
star

357
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:37,360
we have the the probability that the Y

358
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,360
accept is some funed by some

359
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:44,039
constant so the randomness is over q and

360
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,720
the is B by some so so here uh we can

361
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,520
always do some parel repetition to

362
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,960
amplify the winess

363
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,159
sorry to amplify the

364
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,840
soundness so if we do the par repetition

365
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:12,679
Lambda times then the any so we can

366
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:17,480
amplify any constant uh s this Arrow to

367
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:20,760
L to Lambda so then we can set it to be

368
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:25,120
uh two to the minus the order of

369
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:28,360
lamb and the cost of doing this is to uh

370
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,159
is to blow up the size of the query by

371
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,679
uh

372
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,880
Lambda right so so we can so we can

373
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:39,279
always assume with the generality that

374
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:43,159
there exist a PCP for NP well the uh quy

375
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:46,720
complexity is roughly Lambda times

376
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,720
uh polog

377
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,480
C and the the sun this arrow is Du to

378
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,039
the uh roughly two to the minus B so we

379
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,000
will use this kind of

380
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:04,919
PCP uh with this query complexity and

381
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,440
the yeah there are PS with the size

382
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:12,720
of need po C term Oh you mean this term

383
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,480
yeah uh so that uh that's a good

384
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,520
question so it's possible that you can

385
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,720
get rid of the so for example if you

386
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,159
have a very good query complexity then

387
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,440
maybe you don't have this term uh but in

388
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,840
this work I I only so we will need some

389
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,279
additional structure about the PCP and I

390
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,080
only know at least I know it holds for

391
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,480
the

392
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,039
algebraic construction from this r m

393
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,840
code but I don't know if it holds for

394
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,840
General other constructions

395
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,840
PCP

396
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,360
so all right so I'll use this PCP uh so

397
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,840
now now we have K PCP streen and uh we

398
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,080
have a wiif

399
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,919
fire so can you remind how

400
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,640
big right right uh good question so so

401
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,240
the so this is so let's say this is a p

402
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,200
P for NP language L and the NP language

403
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,200
is defined in this

404
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:13,440
way okay so it has a relation circuit

405
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,159
C right and the the then the lens of the

406
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,120
L so L of L is some part in

407
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,320
C the circuit

408
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,919
size uh again it's possible that you

409
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,399
have use some more efficient PCP

410
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,760
construction to uh I think there exist a

411
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,159
PCP such that this L is almost uh almost

412
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,840
uh near near near in the size of the

413
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,440
circuit

414
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:43,279
yeah so

415
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:46,480
okay so we are use this PCP and uh uh so

416
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,520
we use some H function and we will put

417
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,559
the H key in the CRS so the CRS will

418
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,559
contain the H key let's say it's

419
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,120
HK and uh we are going to uh look at so

420
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,000
this PCP are uh so there are binary

421
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,240
strings for each coordinate uh there

422
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,799
binary values in each coordinate and we

423
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,960
are going to use this has function to

424
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,679
has each column of this

425
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:19,039
PCP of those pcps so that means I will

426
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,279
take the first bit of each PCP string

427
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,440
and the concatenate concatenate them

428
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:28,320
together and has them using a h

429
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,159
function so I I apply a h function

430
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,159
function here

431
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,159
uh

432
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,480
so to the to the First Column and I get

433
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,919
some H value

434
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,360
H1 and I will do the same thing for the

435
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,360
second

436
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:53,039
column uh and I can so I can get

437
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,480
H2 so for each column I will har it and

438
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,320
uh so basically so for

439
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,840
the for each column I to get some H

440
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,279
value so if the length of the PCP is L

441
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:09,440
then I get L values

442
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:12,480
okay so and this variant of uh K

443
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,799
protocol work as follows so I first send

444
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,799
all of the uh H values from H1 to

445
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:26,480
HK uh sorry H1 to HL for each

446
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,480
column and uh then I will have the

447
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,480
wifire to send one single piece P

448
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,720
query so a PCP query uh remember is a

449
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,720
subset of

450
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:47,080
indices okay so so this is one single PP

451
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,039
query for so I mean it's a PCP query for

452
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:55,799
one of the state one of the PCP string

453
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:58,000
and uh finally I will uh open the quar

454
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,240
column for this H function for those H

455
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,240
function

456
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,799
okay so so what do I

457
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:17,679
mean

458
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,640
so so this is uh so you can view this uh

459
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:26,480
uh PCP string as a matrix so this Matrix

460
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:30,600
has a uh uh L columns and uh uh K rows

461
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,240
right so and for and for each for this

462
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,000
one single PCP query uh it will query

463
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,399
some of the position so suppose uh it

464
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,039
querries this second position and the

465
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,240
last last position then I will open the

466
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:49,360
corresponding column for this qu

467
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,360
position so so let's denote the uh so

468
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,399
let's denote the First Column

469
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,240
as as column one and the second column

470
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,200
as column two Etc

471
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,919
then the the third round message will

472
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,919
contain all the all of the uh column

473
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:13,880
Q where this Q is in this uh quir is in

474
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,000
this

475
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:20,600
subset okay so so this is essentially

476
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,960
the same as Kon uh except that I don't I

477
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:27,720
don't use uh uh merco tree to commit

478
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,919
them I use uh I use a h function to

479
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,760
directly

480
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,760
uh H each column

481
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:43,399
separately Yeah question use to

482
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:46,519
H1 uh H1 uh so at this point I do not

483
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,320
use the m commm so I directly send them

484
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,840
to the

485
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,919
wifire so

486
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,320
okay so I sent them in the first message

487
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,840
so by sending them I already fixed the

488
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,720
PCP Matrix intuitively

489
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,440
so then uh after the so after I fix them

490
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,480
uh I have the wifi send the the PCP

491
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,919
query and uh I have the pro to answer

492
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,799
the same PCP query for all of the

493
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,440
PCP yeah follow the third message here

494
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:24,440
is

495
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,440
that SC okay yes yes good uh good

496
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:33,240
observation

497
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,240
so so this is the initial protocol

498
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,880
so right

499
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,480
yeah does

500
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,760
sending all those key blocks is that

501
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,440
small enough for the verier uh sorry is

502
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,120
it uh you mean k this yeah when you open

503
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,559
the column is that small enough for the

504
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,080
verifier is that enough for the verifier

505
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:28,039
no small yeah it's a so good so the so

506
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,000
the size of Q is only uh you can think

507
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:33,320
is almost the polog in the size of the

508
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,799
circuit C so so the so the Q is very

509
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,399
small you can think so for each for each

510
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,840
for each row I'm going to open uh for

511
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,799
each row I'm going to open C positions

512
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,480
so I have K rows so the third R message

513
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:51,600
is almost K * Q which is uh almost K it

514
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,159
gr always

515
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,200
K

516
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,200
yeah so the right so so what does the

517
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:05,919
wif fire do so the verifier will uh it

518
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:09,399
will first so the verifier will first

519
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:13,840
uh verify the opening is consistent with

520
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,840
the hash so it will verify

521
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,639
has and the the verification process is

522
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,279
uh the Wii just recompute the hash for

523
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:25,399
this C position and see if they are

524
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,919
consistent with the first round message

525
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:33,159
so it will hat the

526
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:35,720
use some H function uh applied to the

527
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:39,440
qued position and check if it the same

528
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:45,120
as uh HQ for for each of the

529
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:48,320
Q in this uh in this qu subset and

530
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,799
secondly the verifier also need

531
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:55,600
to uh verify the PCP so the W will run

532
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,399
the PCP verification for this uh for

533
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,200
each of the statements from X1 to XK so

534
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,279
it's around the PCP verification for

535
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,080
XI and

536
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,639
the right and for the same quy que and

537
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,200
the PCP answer PCP answer for the is row

538
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:17,360
is

539
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:21,760
the for the is stemma Xi is the piece is

540
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:25,039
the I coordinate of the of this column

541
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:29,840
vector and uh you take the collection of

542
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,840
all of the uh such position in

543
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,960
Q yeah so that's the initial

544
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,679
protocol but but this protocol is a

545
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,200
interactive protocol so to build a snark

546
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,159
we need

547
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,880
to uh make it non-interactive so so I

548
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,279
think last lecture before Thanksgiving

549
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,080
uh so so the that lecture is about the

550
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,519
correlation inable hash and how to use

551
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,799
it to build a non- interative proof from

552
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,279
interactive proof so let me recall what

553
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,279
is correlation in trable

554
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,760
hash

555
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:11,559
uh so uh correlation in trable

556
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,559
has

557
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,399
uh so I will call it a

558
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,360
c c for a relation I

559
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,360
for a

560
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:42,360
relation for for a relation R so R is a

561
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,360
subset of x uh times y so X here is

562
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,960
the uh right right okay so for for some

563
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,559
in some subset of X and

564
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:54,039
Y

565
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,799
uh is is a t of

566
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,399
algorithms so the T consist of a key

567
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,399
generator

568
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,519
a key generator and a

569
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,039
c

570
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,840
and

571
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,919
so and it satisfies the following

572
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:16,359
property so for

573
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,359
any uh other uh nonuniform PBT

574
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,079
adversary uh we need we need the

575
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,800
following

576
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:31,560
condition so so the adversary is first

577
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,879
the given the has key generated by some

578
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:39,599
uh let's say this this is c

579
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:42,000
key generat by the key gen

580
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,919
algorithm and the adversary is required

581
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,679
to Output find the some input X such

582
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:50,520
that

583
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,919
uh the pair of the X and the hash of and

584
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,919
the say has of uh

585
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,919
X

586
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:05,000
so so the par of them is in R so this

587
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,839
invent is bonded by some meable

588
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,839
amount

589
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:14,720
yeah so this is uh what you learned from

590
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,800
the last lecture so this is just a

591
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,800
recap and

592
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,800
uh

593
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:31,400
yes so given uh and also recall so given

594
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,200
such a h function how do you compare an

595
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,280
interactive proof to a non-interactive

596
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,320
one so the idea is you start with some

597
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:42,880
uh so given any three round public coin

598
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,040
uh interactive protocol so public coin

599
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,920
means second round message is a uniform

600
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,240
random

601
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,960
string so suppose you have such a

602
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,119
protocol then you can compile it using

603
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,640
this H function to obtain a non-

604
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,640
interactive one

605
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:03,960
so the proof consist of the transcript

606
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:09,160
of the of the protocal so proof is just

607
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:12,800
RF and uh beta so beta equals the S of

608
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,119
the S key and the

609
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,040
arpha and the

610
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:23,000
gamma

611
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:25,400
so uh and uh okay

612
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,880
so and we need to recall how do you

613
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,640
prove the soundness of the of the is a

614
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,640
non- interactive

615
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,119
protocal so to prove the soundness uh

616
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,200
how do we use this correlation inability

617
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,680
to prove the soundness so to prove the

618
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,280
soundness you need to First Define a

619
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,400
relation and the relation is the

620
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,240
relation R so it consist of the all the

621
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,880
first run and second run message Alpha

622
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:57,599
Beta such that there exist Sol around

623
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,599
message that can make the wi fire accept

624
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,960
so you define this relation for the

625
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:09,560
interactive protocol and uh um right so

626
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,560
in two and then so for any proof for any

627
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,560
uh so to prove the soundness we need to

628
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:20,280
consider this x the case One X is not in

629
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:23,280
L and uh yes for X is not in L and

630
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,720
suppose any cheating prover let's say we

631
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,280
have a cheating prover it output a

632
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,599
cheating proof so cheating proof

633
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,040
uh so the CH let's say chover output CH

634
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,160
improve Alpha star beta star and the

635
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,640
gamma

636
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:43,400
star and if the proof is accepted then

637
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,400
this means uh so if this proof is

638
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,160
accepted then this means uh this beta

639
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,440
star equals the

640
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,160
C of alpha

641
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:06,680
star under the c key so I I ignore the c

642
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:09,680
key here and uh and also this uh yeah

643
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:13,560
and this also the original verification

644
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,800
passes so so let me so here is a

645
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,319
different verification so and the

646
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,920
original

647
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:20,920
uh verification

648
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,240
passes so this means this alpha alpha

649
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,359
star and the beta star is in this

650
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,960
relation and this is how you prove the

651
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,359
soundness uh because so if a cheating

652
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,720
prover exist then you uh reach a

653
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,560
contradiction with the correlation

654
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,560
intractability because the cheating

655
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,280
improver also output input and output

656
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,520
pair uh such that this uh such that this

657
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,960
beta equals the H of alpha but uh it

658
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,560
satisfies this relation

659
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,839
R uh so this is from the last last last

660
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,839
lecture any

661
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,839
questions okay so so here uh I want to

662
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:10,319
emphasize here that uh there is a

663
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:14,000
condition in this proof so the condition

664
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:18,359
is uh so we need this uh for for such a

665
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,800
say to exist we need the the uh this

666
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:25,240
relation r

667
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,079
r it needs to be uh

668
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:33,359
sparse so what do I mean

669
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:37,000
uh or evasive so so sparse here means uh

670
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,160
for any fixed Alpha the fraction of the

671
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,040
beta that can make this pair Alpha Beta

672
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,520
is satisfies this relation is a

673
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,680
negligible fraction so it

674
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,680
means uh of beta such

675
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,319
that Alpha Beta is is

676
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:02,079
R if you divide it by the all the fra

677
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:04,119
all the the size of Y then we need this

678
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,640
to be

679
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:12,079
negligible so this condition is crucial

680
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:15,440
for the for the S to exist the reason

681
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,880
is uh do any know do anyone know why

682
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,880
this is the

683
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:29,040
case so so let's consider our extreme

684
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:33,400
case so so let's say uh if if there

685
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,880
exist uh so let's say if there

686
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,040
exist let's consider extreme extreme

687
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,400
case so let's say if there exist some

688
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:45,000
alpha alpha Z some fixed Alpha z uh

689
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,839
which is in the input input

690
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,560
space such that uh all of the all for

691
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:56,280
all of the beta this Alpha and the

692
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,000
beta is Alpha zero beta is in is in this

693
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,760
r

694
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,680
then it means that uh then for any H

695
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,480
function it cannot be correlation in

696
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,599
triable for Sr because any H function

697
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,400
will output something something some

698
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:17,040
Beta And it satisfies this

699
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,960
relation so so this condition uh so at

700
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,160
least we need this fraction to be less

701
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,640
than one okay

702
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,880
so the problem is uh if we want to apply

703
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,040
the C constru

704
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,319
here uh it's not clear whether we can

705
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,880
define a relation uh that is sparse

706
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,800
so so let's modify the construction

707
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,800
using this C

708
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:47,880
parad okay so the conu we all

709
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:50,760
replace replace the second message

710
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,319
Q so instead of having the wifi send the

711
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,520
Q we uh we have the prover comput this

712
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,520
queue by itself using the C

713
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,760
and uh so the so now we apply the S to

714
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,880
all of the first round message h12

715
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:17,280
HQ uh sorry h12

716
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:21,280
HL and we put the say key inside of the

717
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,280
CRS okay

718
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,119
so next I will uh Define a relation R

719
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,119
and try to prove the soundness

720
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,720
so yeah can you see what changes you

721
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,160
made again just yeah is

722
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,760
good so the changes is uh instead of

723
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,079
having the approver to send a message to

724
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,720
the verifier and have the warier send

725
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:45,680
back a challenge I'm going to have the

726
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:50,200
prover uh not send this H1 to

727
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,839
HL so the Prov directly apply a c to H1

728
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,720
to HL and obtain some query so you can

729
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,880
Pro so the prover can proceed to the S

730
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,240
round and uh finish the s

731
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,839
so the proof well consist of the

732
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,520
transcript of the protocol which is the

733
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:09,760
all of the H1 to H and the and the thir

734
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,160
message okay yeah um what assumption are

735
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,640
we making for like we need the the

736
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,599
output space of the C to be like some

737
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,119
sense that the verifier would query or

738
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:22,200
something right right uh good question

739
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,440
so uh so in fact we need the the PCP to

740
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,599
be a public coin so yeah that's the

741
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,800
that's the implicit condition so so so

742
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:34,920
so the uh so in the general case the PCP

743
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,480
quari may not be uniform random so you

744
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,359
need to uh so in fact there is some uh

745
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,839
PCP so the some query sampler that take

746
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:48,200
some uniform random string and it will

747
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,680
uh compute the actual PCP query so yeah

748
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,240
so we're also kind of assuming that the

749
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,440
output of C is like kind of uniform

750
00:44:52,240 --> 00:45:00,119
disted or like super random uh yeah I

751
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:03,960
mean so uh okay so so in the general so

752
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:07,480
in fact uh so this is just some

753
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,319
uh uh some way to describe the the how

754
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,119
you generate the query so in fact the

755
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:15,880
PCP query is generated by using the

756
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,960
using some uh query some query generator

757
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,720
or some

758
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,359
sampler so the sampler will take some

759
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,359
uniform Randomness R and the generator

760
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,000
PCP query so what you do is you you take

761
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:30,359
the say output of the S as the as the

762
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,680
randomness and then you generate it from

763
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:36,680
it to get a PCP

764
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,680
query

765
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:50,319
yeah okay so so next I will try to prove

766
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,920
the uh security of this uh

767
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,000
construction try to prove the soundness

768
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,480
so complet is easy to show you just uh

769
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,400
you can do it yourself yeah so for the

770
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,200
sound and I will only prove the

771
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,800
soundness here so

772
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,359
yeah

773
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,960
whatever indes for PCP we

774
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:13,960
generate probility

775
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:24,119
onep

776
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:26,760
uh for the PCP yeah is complet this one

777
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:29,640
oh right right yes yeah we we assume

778
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:34,839
there um yeah we we choose uh PCP with

779
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,839
perfect correctness yeah yeah good

780
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,839
question okay

781
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:47,599
so so let's let's first attempt uh let's

782
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,599
first try to prove the uh

783
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,720
solness so the initial attempt is to

784
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,599
define a relation R similar to the

785
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,640
relation r as before so we just Define

786
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:09,160
it as uh the relation R consist of all

787
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:14,000
the pairs of H1 to H HL and uh the query

788
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,559
set Q such that there exist uh so there

789
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,240
exist a s message so so gamma here is

790
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,240
the S

791
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,839
message such as the wirefire accept

792
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,880
uh and

793
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:45,199
[Applause]

794
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,319
uh so so if so this is the initial

795
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,960
attempt to prove the soundness so we'll

796
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:59,680
do the same thing so this R is the the

797
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,920
same as the relation R we defined for

798
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,319
the C here uh except I just replac the

799
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,800
alpha beta gamma with the with this

800
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:10,680
protocol okay so but the issue is with

801
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,839
this relation is not clear whether this

802
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,599
relation is a spar relation the reason

803
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,440
is

804
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:23,440
uh the reason is that I remember so so

805
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,760
this uh right the the reason is that uh

806
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,800
this H function must be a compressing H

807
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,960
function so if we choose a comprising h

808
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:35,040
function then for any H value H1 to HL

809
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,000
there might be multiple pre-images of

810
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:41,599
the PCP so for one PCP so let's say we

811
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,200
have one pre-image of the PCP which is

812
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:49,119
pcp1 to PCP uh k then for those PCP you

813
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,359
may have a a queue that can make them

814
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,280
accept you may have a one que to make

815
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:57,200
them accept but for other pre-image of

816
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:02,040
the PCP it may have another q that can

817
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:04,079
make the uh query accept so uh so if you

818
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,200
know this relation we take the union of

819
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,839
all those all of those PCP queries so

820
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,280
it's not clear uh it if this reation has

821
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:13,839
sparity less than

822
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,280
one

823
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:21,480
yeah uh so so what we will do is we will

824
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,440
choose a special H function and uh uh so

825
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,960
the this spal H function is still

826
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,480
compressing but it will show us uh still

827
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,599
has some information about this

828
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,640
pre-image so now I will Define this uh

829
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,640
uh special H

830
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,960
function so the so the H function is

831
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:50,960
called uh somewhere statistical binding

832
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,960
hash so

833
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:12,280
or I will call it SSB so it's a yeah so

834
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:16,319
it's a SSB so such a function is defined

835
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:21,079
as follows so it has a

836
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,079
so SSB is also a two of

837
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,839
algorithms so it has a key generator and

838
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,720
some SSB has

839
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:33,520
algorithm uh with the following

840
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,079
syntax

841
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,760
so uh the key generation algorithm will

842
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,760
sample some

843
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,440
key and the the key generator will also

844
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:49,319
uh it will take some security parameter

845
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,839
Lambda as input and also it will take

846
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:53,680
some index I as

847
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,520
input

848
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:02,359
okay such that uh

849
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,400
and then the uh SSB hash algorithm will

850
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:07,720
use

851
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:10,960
the SSB key and uh it will take some

852
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,720
message X1 to xn as input and output

853
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,440
some has and we require the following

854
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:19,480
two property so the first property is

855
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:23,599
called a key in distinguishability

856
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:26,599
or a key hiding uh okay so key is

857
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,599
distinguish

858
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:42,960
so it says that uh for any uh two

859
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:46,880
indices uh so i1 and I2 in this n so

860
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,720
the the key generated by the using the

861
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,040
first IND indices is IND distinguishable

862
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,040
with

863
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,599
the with the key generated by the second

864
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,880
index index

865
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,640
and the second property is called uh

866
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,640
statistical

867
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:20,920
binding so statistical binding says

868
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,119
um so it basically says the H function

869
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:28,520
is binding for the

870
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,520
position uh I so it says uh for any

871
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:35,000
uh right so for any X1 to

872
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:40,240
xn and

873
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:44,400
the X1 Prime P XM Prime so

874
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:48,960
if if the SSB has of

875
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,960
them is the same

876
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:08,599
um then then we have this XI equals XI

877
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,960
Prime okay so it says the H value will

878
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:12,440
bind the value at the I position of this

879
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,000
input

880
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:20,480
XI uh so so here the k k i require the

881
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,200
so here the K is generated in this way

882
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,200
for this index I

883
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:50,480
okay uh any question yeah can you

884
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:53,680
explain why that relation might not be

885
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,839
sparse all right so it's not clear why

886
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,160
this uh it's not clear whether this is

887
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,160
sparse or not

888
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:04,640
the the reason is that uh

889
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:07,680
so so here uh the reason is that uh for

890
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,559
so because this has so H1 to HL are the

891
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,280
har values so so you can think uh so

892
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:19,799
initially we have this pcp1 to PCP K and

893
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:22,599
we H them to a sucin h value H1 to

894
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:24,440
HL but the the size of has is much

895
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:29,079
smaller than the

896
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:33,079
pre-image so so for for a fixed h12 HL

897
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:35,200
there might be multiple uh pre-images so

898
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:37,119
and for one for one pre-image it may

899
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,040
have some for for example for this uh

900
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,240
for this fixed one pre-image it may have

901
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,000
some uh quy set queue that can make all

902
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,480
of the query be

903
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,079
accepted but uh but there might be some

904
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,760
other uh PCP pre-image for the for the

905
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:55,079
same h12 HQ so let's say it's some pcp1

906
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,559
to PCP K

907
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:01,559
Prim okay and uh and they they may also

908
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,599
hash to the same same has value so if

909
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:09,119
this is the case then for those set of

910
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:13,440
uh pcp1 to PCP K PR they may have some

911
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:17,160
other query set QPR that can uh make the

912
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:21,200
make make each of the pcp1 Prime to PCP

913
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:25,400
K Prime be accepted so so but if this is

914
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,720
the case then of then this q and Q Prime

915
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,160
need to be so they are also in this

916
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:34,200
relation R right so so if this is the

917
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:42,119
case then both of this uh then you know

918
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:42,119
this h12 HL HL and Q is in this R and

919
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:48,359
uh and the Q Prime is also in

920
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:50,880
R so so you can do this do this argument

921
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:53,559
for each of the pre-image of this H1 to

922
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:57,920
HQ and and the issue is there are many

923
00:55:53,559 --> 00:56:00,440
many many pre-images so the the is very

924
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,359
compressing right so the number of

925
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,960
preimages is much larger than the uh

926
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:09,039
than than the size of the que all

927
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,280
possibilities of que so yeah yeah in

928
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,079
order for a cheat to like take advantage

929
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,119
of

930
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,240
this they would have to like find a

931
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,720
collision like that right right so why

932
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,880
are we worried about this uh good

933
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,200
question so it's not clear whether so

934
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,599
for example if you take a specific H

935
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,000
function it's not clear whether the uh

936
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:29,119
prover can leverage this kind of back

937
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,520
but uh it's also not clear how to prove

938
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,520
the soundness so yeah

939
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,200
so okay so next I will show you how to

940
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,599
build such

941
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:50,240
a yeah any question okay so next I I'll

942
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,240
show you how to build such a SSB uh from

943
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,520
FH so

944
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:06,720
so the construction is uh very simple um

945
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:09,960
so do you remember uh what is FH so FH

946
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:13,359
is some uh public key encryption where

947
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:16,880
you can given a separate text of M you

948
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:19,319
can homop evaluate on the SE Tex uh for

949
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:24,880
any function f and to get a SE text of f

950
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:28,880
of M so that's the F so to build SSB uh

951
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:30,480
we we do the following so from the F

952
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,720
okay

953
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:38,280
so for the key generation uh so for the

954
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,640
index I we're going to generate FH

955
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:46,319
separate text of

956
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:49,440
I and uh right yeah so and we we Define

957
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:53,799
this seate text as the SSB

958
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:56,640
key okay and uh to use this uh separate

959
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:57,960
text to Hash X1 tox

960
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,599
uh

961
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:04,520
and the idea the idea is we're going to

962
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:08,720
homomorphically pick the iest position

963
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:13,119
uh under hood of FH for those X1 to X1

964
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,119
so so what we will do is

965
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:21,640
um um we will do the homic evaluation of

966
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:27,119
some function f uh and F has X1 to X and

967
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:31,799
Hollow in it and uh we'll do this homk

968
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:36,039
on the on the separate text

969
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:40,680
I and this is our H value so here this F

970
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:42,599
is defined as follows so FX1 to X1 given

971
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:46,480
index I it will output the

972
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:51,200
I I coordinate so intuitively you just

973
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,200
pick the uh XI under the hood of

974
00:58:51,240 --> 00:59:00,359
F and uh so yeah so okay so here so this

975
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:03,760
is a has function because the size of

976
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:08,640
the H value is just a separate text so

977
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,640
the size of has value is po po

978
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:14,039
LDA yeah and the key in this in

979
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,599
distinguish ability follows from the

980
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:21,799
security of f because the index I is

981
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:24,640
hiding and the

982
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:27,160
the yeah so the second property this

983
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,200
statistical binding you can you can show

984
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,839
it directly because it the because the

985
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:36,280
has value contains

986
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:36,280
the uh the homic incretion of

987
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:42,880
XI

988
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,880
yeah uh any

989
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:52,640
questions okay so I uh so later we will

990
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,640
use this SSB but we we use a additional

991
00:59:52,640 --> 01:00:00,280
property so this property is called uh

992
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:03,440
uh extion so so intuitively this

993
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:07,000
separate this uh uh H value it contains

994
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:12,200
the sep Tex of XI

995
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,200
so uh so in fact it contains

996
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:19,280
F and if you know if you know the secur

997
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:22,520
key of FH you can uh even decrypt this I

998
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:25,520
from the hash value so we need a uh

999
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,520
extraction

1000
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,599
and it's just so extraction property

1001
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,920
says that there exist an

1002
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:39,760
extractor so extractor is a PO algorithm

1003
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:42,480
and uh moreover uh moreover so in the

1004
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,280
key generat algorithm I will add a TR in

1005
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,240
it so the key generator will also output

1006
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,160
some trap and uh there is some extractor

1007
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,640
such

1008
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:56,119
that uh the extractor will out will take

1009
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:59,839
the trap door as input and also the

1010
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:02,960
value as input and it will extract

1011
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:05,640
something okay and we and we further

1012
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:10,160
require the extractory has correctness

1013
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,160
which means for any X1 to

1014
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:21,039
xn if you has it under key

1015
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:25,799
K and you uh so let's say s h is the has

1016
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,799
of the X1 to X1

1017
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:36,119
then the extracted value is consistent

1018
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,119
with the XI with XI then this

1019
01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:48,799
uh okay so this is the extraction

1020
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:52,440
correctness so if if the key uh if this

1021
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:52,440
has key is for the for the is

1022
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,039
position it's gener if the H ke is

1023
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:59,039
generated for the is

1024
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:12,480
position okay so now uh so now we will

1025
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:15,520
we will go back to the

1026
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,839
construction so now we have this SSB

1027
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:22,079
hash from uh F we'll go back through

1028
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:26,680
this construction and modify the has

1029
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,960
function this H function we use so

1030
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:32,319
the H function we use will we will use

1031
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:37,839
this uh we all use SSB

1032
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:40,359
hush and the SSB key is uh we will move

1033
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:43,520
it to the we'll move the We'll add the

1034
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:48,119
SSB key to the CRS

1035
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,119
so so this is SSB

1036
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:57,680
key so now we will use this SSB has to

1037
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,319
has each column of the PCP Matrix to

1038
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,319
this PCP

1039
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,240
Matrix and the uh all the other things

1040
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:12,720
are the same as before uh any questions

1041
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:16,279
okay uh yeah maybe the we also need to

1042
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:20,000
when we verify the H we also use SSB to

1043
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:20,000
recompute the each column and the

1044
01:03:22,839 --> 01:03:26,839
verify uh

1045
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,359
um when you're doing the

1046
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,440
SS right exactly so in fact in the in

1047
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:45,520
the actual construction uh in fact you

1048
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,279
don't even need I because FH is separate

1049
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:50,720
text in the actual construction is sudo

1050
01:03:47,279 --> 01:03:53,240
random but you can you can uh you can

1051
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,480
put any index ey there

1052
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:00,760
yeah so

1053
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:04,520
okay so if we now if we use SSB has to H

1054
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,480
each column uh of this uh Matrix what

1055
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:11,359
will

1056
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:15,240
happen so so let's say the uh so let's

1057
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:18,119
say if the SSB H is generate the H key

1058
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:22,920
is generated for some index I

1059
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:25,880
star okay so then uh intuitively this

1060
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:28,880
means uh this SSB is binding for the the

1061
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:32,119
i i row of this

1062
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:36,200
Matrix the reason is that uh for each

1063
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:39,440
for each for each has value we Has It by

1064
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:43,079
we obtain it by hasing the some column

1065
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,240
of this Matrix has has for example the

1066
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,839
first has value is obtained by has the

1067
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:51,079
First Column of this Matrix and now if

1068
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:52,920
the SSB is binding for the is coordinate

1069
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:55,799
so the is coordinate now corresponds to

1070
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,520
the is row of this Matrix the first

1071
01:04:55,799 --> 01:05:00,440
coordinate of the is row of this Matrix

1072
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:05,119
and the same is true for other columns

1073
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:08,720
so for each column we will B the is

1074
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:10,839
position and that means uh this SSB is

1075
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,359
binding for the is

1076
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:16,440
row

1077
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:20,839
so for for the I I start

1078
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:24,240
row and intuitively you can think uh H

1079
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:28,079
h12 H will contain the all the full

1080
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,079
information about the is r of this

1081
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,960
Matrix uh because the h12 HL they

1082
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:37,680
they're just FH SE text

1083
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:43,119
so it contains the actual value of the

1084
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:43,119
is row okay uh any

1085
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:53,920
questions right right a good question so

1086
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:57,599
let's let's uh continue uh let's

1087
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,599
continue this proof

1088
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,760
so

1089
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,960
uh

1090
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:22,400
okay so we want to prove the soundness

1091
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:25,200
of this uh snark so how we how do we

1092
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:30,760
prove it so to prove the soundness we

1093
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:33,599
need to show for any uh X1 to X XK such

1094
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,599
that uh

1095
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,720
X1

1096
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:43,760
uh XK X12 XK is in L doesn't

1097
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:48,400
hold then no cheating improver can break

1098
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:51,400
the

1099
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,400
snark

1100
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:57,880
so so we start with the statement uh X1

1101
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,760
to XK in language doesn't hold but what

1102
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,000
does this

1103
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:05,880
mean so the key so the key observation

1104
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,319
here is that uh so if this doesn't hold

1105
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:12,400
then there exist some index I let's say

1106
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:18,880
it's index I star some index I star such

1107
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:21,520
that uh uh this XI star is not in L so

1108
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:24,160
it means that uh if you want to prove

1109
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,920
the soundness you only need uh if you

1110
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,960
want to prove the soundness there is one

1111
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,839
statement x i star that is not in this

1112
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:35,640
language and the goal is to just catch

1113
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:38,440
this I star then we can prove the S

1114
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:41,119
this okay so we only to use the one

1115
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,880
statements is not in this language and

1116
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:47,000
that's how we use

1117
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:49,599
SSB so so remember SSB can find the is

1118
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,520
position is coordin is row of this PCP

1119
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:56,319
Matrix so the iow of the PCP Matrix is

1120
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:59,559
the PCP for XI so

1121
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:00,760
that's yeah so that give us some this so

1122
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:03,760
that's the

1123
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,760
intuition

1124
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:14,720
so you're Bing is the one langage right

1125
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:18,040
right uh good question so so the proof

1126
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:22,199
so the formal proof goes like this

1127
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:25,799
so so the good question so the formal

1128
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:27,799
proof works as follows so so in the

1129
01:08:25,799 --> 01:08:32,759
first in the first hybrid

1130
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:35,839
HZ uh we have a adversary uh

1131
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:38,480
so suppose we have some adversary P star

1132
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:41,040
that can break the construction break

1133
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:44,040
the soundness of the construction so

1134
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,400
what it will receive so P star will

1135
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:50,279
receive the uh

1136
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:54,000
CRS some some CRS star some CRS and it

1137
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:55,839
will output some cheting proove P star

1138
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,359
and the verification of the the proof

1139
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,359
will be

1140
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:09,640
accepted so uh right so the

1141
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,719
verification uh of the proof will be

1142
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:16,400
accepted and uh this happens with

1143
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,400
probability greater than some

1144
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:23,040
Epson

1145
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,040
Okay so

1146
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:31,000
so in the next hybrid uh I

1147
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:52,799
will so in the next hybrid I know there

1148
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:56,320
is a a index I star and the x i x i star

1149
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:57,640
is not in the language so well so this I

1150
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,840
star is

1151
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:06,199
fixed right so I can switch the CRS so

1152
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:15,480
in the hybrid H1 I will switch

1153
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:15,480
the switch CRS so to this s generated by

1154
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:26,560
SSB generation this using the I

1155
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:31,760
star so let's let's denote this by uh

1156
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:33,020
SSB okay so by sorry

1157
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,139
this

1158
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,139
[Music]

1159
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:51,080
two k i star SSB uh Ki star

1160
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:53,560
okay and and I can argue if this is the

1161
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,920
case then we still

1162
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,760
have uh

1163
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,320
so this this new CRS let's call it CRS

1164
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:05,719
star so CRS star will contains this uh

1165
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:08,880
this SSB Ki star in it and it will

1166
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:11,920
generate some Pi Pi

1167
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:15,360
star and it still has

1168
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,360
the property

1169
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:27,480
as so this is greater than one minus

1170
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:29,600
negligible so so so this is true because

1171
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,800
uh so this just follows from the key in

1172
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,800
distinguish ability because the key is

1173
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,800
hiding

1174
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,159
okay so now in this hybrid we switch the

1175
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,520
uh so you can so intuitively you can

1176
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:52,159
think

1177
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,560
the you can think uh given so given any

1178
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:59,360
cheating proof uh in fact the is RO of

1179
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:01,159
the PCP is already fixed so next we will

1180
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,199
reach a contradiction using correlation

1181
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:07,040
in trable

1182
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,040
hash okay

1183
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,080
so

1184
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:24,679
so so clim if the wirefire is accepted

1185
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:26,880
so uh so the claim is for any proof for

1186
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:31,239
any

1187
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:35,800
proof uh the cheating proof uh has this

1188
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:38,480
H1 star to HL star and

1189
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:41,320
the Q star and the gamma

1190
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:43,280
star so gamma star is the Solon message

1191
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,400
I denote it as gamma

1192
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:48,719
star so this is a information

1193
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:53,120
theoretical claim and the claim is just

1194
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:57,120
if the if the Ching proof is accepted

1195
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,120
so oh sorry

1196
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:09,199
is then it must be case that this Q star

1197
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:11,760
uh sorry then it must be case that this

1198
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:14,320
H1 to

1199
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:17,199
HL star uh Q

1200
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:21,679
star is in this relation

1201
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:25,320
R uh so here I need to so R is uh is

1202
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:26,960
almost the r above but uh I want uh

1203
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:35,000
redefine a new

1204
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:35,000
R so R is well contains of the h12 H

1205
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:45,840
HL and the

1206
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:49,920
Q so so given h12 HL I can extract I can

1207
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,920
use the extractor to

1208
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:59,560
extract to extract

1209
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:03,360
PCP right because the that's from the

1210
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:06,280
extraction of the SSB so so so this PCP

1211
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:10,080
is the PCP for the I start

1212
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:13,159
position and then I Define this R

1213
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:19,239
so as follows so I

1214
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:19,239
require uh I require the PCP is

1215
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,760
accepted for XI

1216
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:41,880
yeah so I requ so in this definition of

1217
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:47,440
r i first extract the is

1218
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:50,600
PCP and then I check if the query que is

1219
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:57,000
uh query queue can make this PCP be

1220
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,000
accepted for the is is uh statement X

1221
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:03,400
start

1222
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:03,400
okay so yeah any

1223
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,080
questions uh is this

1224
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:19,600
clear

1225
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,280
so so intuitively uh in the third round

1226
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,639
message if the proof is accepted then

1227
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,920
anything uh so in the in the third round

1228
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:30,080
message the Prov need to give some

1229
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:32,679
Columns of the qued position so at the

1230
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:36,440
so so for all of those columns if you

1231
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:39,120
look at the is is star row of it it must

1232
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:42,840
be consistent with the extracted

1233
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:46,719
PCP because the because the S because we

1234
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,719
have the SSB extraction

1235
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,840
correctness yeah

1236
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:54,639
so

1237
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:58,880
yeah so we Define the r in this way so

1238
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:58,880
in fact is the almost same as the r

1239
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:06,239
Above So now uh now I can so to prove

1240
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,679
this claim is just a the prove of this

1241
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:12,120
clim is just the argument I set up set

1242
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:14,080
just now so uh so for any cheating proof

1243
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,719
if it's uh if the verification of the

1244
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,480
proof is accepted then from the

1245
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:21,760
correctness of the uh

1246
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:24,080
extraction the

1247
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:28,320
so uh from the correctness of the

1248
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:31,719
extraction uh uh okay maybe let me write

1249
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:35,639
it so if the

1250
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:35,639
if if P star is

1251
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:47,840
accepted then from the uh SSB extraction

1252
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,840
correctness

1253
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:05,400
we know this

1254
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:12,360
uh PCP iar so the PCP iar we exract from

1255
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:16,360
the from this H1 to HQ uh sorry H1 to

1256
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,360
HL uh

1257
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:38,719
so so let's say it's some PCP I start uh

1258
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,719
PCP star

1259
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:50,360
then uh if you look at the uh Q's

1260
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,400
coordinate okay so if you look at the

1261
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:57,520
q's coordinate then it must uh okay so

1262
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,520
let me writing this

1263
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:11,199
way the column star so column star are

1264
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:11,199
uh

1265
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,719
yeah

1266
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:26,760
so where the thir round message are just

1267
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,760
the columns so

1268
01:18:43,639 --> 01:18:50,600
yeah okay so that's the soundness

1269
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,840
proof oh so okay so that's the proof of

1270
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,000
the

1271
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,719
clamp yeah any question

1272
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,600
in the

1273
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:05,320
hybrid how do you identify which I

1274
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:08,000
start you need to know which statement

1275
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,600
was good question so this uh this

1276
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,560
soundless proof is uh nonuniform so it's

1277
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:17,000
a non-adaptive so the sunless proof

1278
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:20,800
start with fixed X12 XK so for any fixed

1279
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,199
X12 XK you know uh there exist I star

1280
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:27,239
that x i star is false so you know there

1281
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:30,639
exist a fix the I star so that x i star

1282
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:30,639
is false is not in

1283
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:37,960
L yeah so that's given so you can you

1284
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,719
can think it's given to the reduction in

1285
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:41,719
a nonuniform way

1286
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:10,199
yeah okay so so the okay so this is from

1287
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,800
the extracted so if you extracted

1288
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:15,400
some uh so this is from the SSV

1289
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,600
extraction correctness uh you have this

1290
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:23,199
we have the consistency between the

1291
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:26,080
between this PCP extracted and the proof

1292
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:29,120
uh in the Sol round and if the proof If

1293
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:31,960
this cheating proof P star is accepted

1294
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:36,280
uh so then we can we can use the fact

1295
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:39,960
that this P star is accepted so if it is

1296
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:43,440
accepted then then we know this uh uh

1297
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:48,880
this Q This queue is a this que can make

1298
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:52,960
this PCP uh PCP star be accepted

1299
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:55,360
yeah so then that's complete the uh

1300
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,880
complete the the this clan

1301
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:00,520
and the final differ it can you can uh

1302
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,199
so it's then you can use the correlation

1303
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:07,520
intractability of the

1304
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:07,520
C yeah so P

1305
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:11,199
star

1306
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,960
so so if the proof is accepted then

1307
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,960
this

1308
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:27,239
is the the extract PCP from this uh from

1309
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,080
here it will make this PCP verification

1310
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:38,600
accepted

1311
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:38,600
yeah okay uh let's have a break yeah
