1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
storage is a bit different because there

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,919
isn't really a widely proliferated

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,840
um state-of-the-art already. You know,

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,679
the form of energy storage we use today

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,440
is basically leaving fossil fuels in the

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,880
ground. Like we we have like one-time

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,560
use storage. So, it's like it's all

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,960
stockpiled in the ground. We draw from

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,279
it. We use it at the rate that we want.

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680
Um but there isn't really a rechargeable

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
form of storage above ground that we

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
that has been widely proliferated.

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
Lithium ion batteries are are working

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,599
their way out, but they're limited on

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,880
cost. And so they're going to very

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,719
quickly push up against a ceiling um you

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
know in terms of how much deployment is

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
going to happen due to cost. And so we

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,680
are trying to prep for the second wave

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,559
and come right behind them with with

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,559
something better that's much cheaper.
