retrofitting buildings MIT study shows

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,439
that Ci's plans often won't achieve

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,880
their goals decarbonizing the local grid

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,080
could make the difference written by

Nancy W

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,880
stoffer to support the worldwide

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,760
struggle to reduce carbon emissions many

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,079
cities have made public pledges to cut

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,000
their carbon emissions in by 2030 and

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,079
some have promised to be carbon neutral

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,160
by 2050 buildings can be responsible for

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,600
more than half of municipalities carbon

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,520
emissions today new buildings are

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
typically designed in ways that minimize

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
energy use in carbon emissions so

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,960
attention focuses on cleaning up

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,760
existing buildings a decade ago leaders

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,160
in some cities took the first step in

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,160
that process they Quantified their

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,160
problem Based on data from their

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,039
utilities on natural gas and electricity

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,399
consumption in standard pollutant

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,439
emission rates they calculated how much

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,520
carbon came from their buildings they

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,479
then adopted policies to encourage

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,880
retrofits such as adding instulation

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,479
switching to double glaze windows or

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,280
installing rooftop solar panels but will

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,400
those steps be enough to meet their

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,119
pledges in nearly all cases cities have

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,400
no clear plan for how they're going to

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,799
reach their goal says Kristoff Reinhardt

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
a professor in the department of

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,960
architecture and director of the

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,439
building technology program that's where

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,600
our work comes in

39
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,479
we aim to help them perform analyses so

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,600
they can say if we as a community do a b

41
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,600
and c to buildings of a certain type

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,960
within our jurisdiction then we are

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,880
going to get there to support those

and consulting firm in troba launched a

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,840
publicly accessible website providing a

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,160
series of simulation tools and a process

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
for using them to determine the impacts

of plan steps on a specific building

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,080
stock says Reinhardt the takeaway can be

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,480
a clear technology pathway a combination

59
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,599
of building upgrades renewable energy

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,440
deployments and other measures that will

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,120
enable a community to reach its carbon

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,280
reduction goals for their built

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
environment analyses performed in

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,400
collaboration with policy makers from

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,239
selected cities around the world yielded

66
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
insights demonstrating that reaching

67
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,480
current goals will require more effort

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,840
than City representatives and in a few

69
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,159
cases even the research team had

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,760
anticipated exploring carbon reduction

71
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,239
Pathways the researchers approach Builds

72
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,159
on a physics-based building energy model

73
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,599
or bem akin to those that Architects use

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,599
to design high performance Green

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,519
Building buildings in 2013 Reinhardt and

76
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,560
his team developed a method of extending

77
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,080
that concept to analyze a cluster of

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,319
buildings based on publicly available

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,519
geographic information system GIS data

80
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,840
including each building's type footprint

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,239
and a year of construction the method

82
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
defines the neighborhood including trees

83
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,440
parks and so on and then using

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,760
meteorological data how the buildings

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,239
will interact the air flows among them

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,560
and their energy use the result is an

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,200
urban building energy model or ubm for a

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,159
neighborhood or a whole city the website

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,760
developed by the MIT team enables

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,040
neighborhoods and cities to develop

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
their own ubm and to use it to calculate

92
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,519
their current building energy use and

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,200
resulting carbon emissions and then how

94
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,120
those outcomes would change assuming

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,680
different retrofit programs or other

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,120
measures being implemented or considered

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,079
the website

98
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,040
.io provides step-by-step instructions

99
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,799
and all the simulation tools that a team

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,000
will need to perform an analysis says

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,599
Reinhardt the website starts by

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,840
describing three roles required to

103
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,040
perform an analysis a local

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,959
sustainability champion who is familiar

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,280
with the municipality's carbon reduction

106
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,799
efforts a GIS manager who has access to

107
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,799
the municipality's urban data sets and

108
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,280
maintains a digital model of the built

109
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,560
environment and an energy modeler

110
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,400
typically a hired consultant who has a

111
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,199
background in Green Building Consulting

112
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,280
an individual building energy modeling

113
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,639
the team Begins by defining shallow and

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,960
deep building retrofit scenario scarios

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,479
to explain Reinhardt offers some

116
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,400
examples shallow refers to things that

117
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,759
just happen like when you replace your

118
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,280
old failing appliances with new energy

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,800
efficient ones or you install LED light

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,000
bulbs and weather stripping everywhere

121
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,400
he says deep adds to that list things

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,919
you might do only every 20 years such as

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,360
ripping out walls and putting an

124
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,600
insulation or replacing your gas furnace

125
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,840
with an electric heat pump once those

126
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,280
scenarios are defined the gis manager

127
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,680
uploads to u.io a data set of

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,880
information about the city's buildings

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,680
including their locations and attributes

130
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,720
such as geometry height age and use for

131
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,880
example commercial retail residential

132
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,960
the energy modeler then builds a new bem

133
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,440
to calculate the energy use and carbon

134
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,319
emissions of the existing building stock

135
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,039
once that Baseline is established the

136
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,880
energy modeler can calculate how

137
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,080
specific retrofit measures will change

138
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,080
the

139
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,720
outcomes Workshop to test drive the

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,759
method 2 years ago the MIT team set up a

141
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,400
a 3-day Workshop to test the website

142
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,160
with sample users participants included

143
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,720
policy makers from eight cities and

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,280
municipalities around the world namely

145
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,400
brag Portugal Cairo Egypt Dublin Ireland

146
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,680

middleberry Vermont United States

148
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,880
Montreal Canada and Singapore taken

149
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,039
together the cities represent a wide

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,120
range of climates socioeconomic

151
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,680
demographics cultures governing

152
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,960
structures and sizes working with the

153
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,840
MIT team the participants presented

154
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
their goals defin shallow and deep

155
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,919
retrofit scenarios for their city and

156
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,400
selected a limited but representative

157
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,599
area for analysis an approach that would

158
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,479
speed up analyses of different options

159
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,840
while also generating results valid for

160
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,720
the city as a whole they then performed

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,599
analyses to quantify the impacts of

162
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,919
their retrofit scenarios finally they

163
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,000
learned how best to present their

164
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,759
findings a critical part of the exercise

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,599
when you do this analysis and bring it

166
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,120
back to the people you can say this is

167
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,120
our homework over the next 30 years if

168
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
we do this we're going to get there says

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Reinhardt that makes you part of the

170
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
community so it's a joint

171
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,919
goal sample

172
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,639
results after the close of the workshop

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
Reinhardt and his team confirmed their

174
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,479
findings for each City and then added

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,680
one more factor to the analyses the

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,560
state of the city's electric grid

177
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,240
several cities in the study had pledged

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,960
to make their grid carbon neutral by

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,120
2050 including the Grid in the analysis

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,360
was therefore critical if a building

181
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,440
becomes all electric and purchases its

182
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,599
electricity from a carbon- free grid

183
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,840
then that building will be carbon

184
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,720
neutral even with no on-site energy

185
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,080
saving retrofits the final analysis for

186
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,160
each City therefore calculated the total

187
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,440
kilogram of carbon dioxide equivalent

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
emitted per square meter of floor space

189
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,319
assuming the following

190
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,919
scenarios the Baseline shallow retrofit

191

most ambitious decarbonization Target

198
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,199
for their power grid the following

199
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,879
paragraphs provide highlights of the

200
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,280
analyses for three of the eight cities

201
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,599
included are the city's setting emission

202
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,840
reduction goals current and proposed

203
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,520
measures and calculations of how

204
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,159
implementation of those measures would

205
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,199
affect their energy use and carbon

206
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,039
emissions

207
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,560
Singapore Singapore is generally hot and

208
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,520
humid and its building energy use is

209
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,000
largely in the form of electricity for

210
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,039
cooling the city is dominated by

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
high-rise buildings so there's not much

212
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,440
space for rooftop solar installations to

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,720
generate the needed electricity

214
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,680
therefore plans for decarbonizing the

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,240
current building stock must involve

216
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,280
retrofits the shallow retrofit scenario

217
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,840
focuses on installing energy efficient

218
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,599
Lighting in appliances to those steps

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,840
the Deep retrofit scenario adds is

220
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,839
adopting a district cooling system

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
Singapore's stated goals are to cut the

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,599
Baseline carbon emissions by about a

223
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,120
third by 2030 and to cut it in half by

224
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,519
2050 the analysis shows that with just

225
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,320
the shallow retrofits Singapore won't

226
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,399
achieve its 2030 goal but with the deep

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,160
retrofits it should come close notably

228
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,640
decarbonizing the electric grid would

229
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,200
enable Singapore to meet and

230
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,320
substantially exceed as 2050 Target

231
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,680
assuming either retrofit

232
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,360
scenario Dublin Dublin has a mild

233
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,440
climate with relatively comfortable

234
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,399
Summers but cold humid Winters as a

235
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,120
result the city's energy use is

236
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,920
dominated by fossil fuels in particular

237
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,440
natural gas for space Heating and

238
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,519
domestic hot water the city presented

239
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,399
just one target a 40% reduction by 2030

240
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,839
Dublin has many neighborhoods made up of

241
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,720
georgean row houses and at the time of

242
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,560
the workshop the city already had a

243
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
program in place encouraging groups of

244
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,519
owners to insulate their walls the

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,519
shallow fit scenario therefore focuses

246
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,320
on weatherization upgrades adding

247
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,920
weather stripping to Windows and Doors

248
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,079
insulating crawl spaces and so on to

249
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,880
that list the Deep retrofit scenario

250
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,560
adds insulating walls and installing

251
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,519
upgraded Windows the participants didn't

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,279
include electric heat pumps as the city

253
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,200
was then assessing the feasibility of

254
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,880
expanding the existing District heating

255
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,440
system results of the analyses show that

256
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
implementing the shallow retrofit

257
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,000
scenario won't enable Dublin to meet its

258
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,880
2030 Target but the Deep retrofit

259
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,560
scenario will however like Singapore

260
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,839
Dublin could make major gains by

261
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,200
decarbonizing its electric grid the

262
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,920
analysis shows that a decarbonized grid

263
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,920
with or without the addition of rooftop

264
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,720
solar panels were possible could more

265
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,959
than have the carbon emissions that

266
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,839
remain in the Deep retrofit scenario

267
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,640
indeed a decarbonized grid plus

268
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,519
electrification of the heating system by

269
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,640
incorporating heat pumps could enable

270
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,279
Dublin to meet a future Net Zero

Target middleberry middleberry Vermont

272

has warm wet Summers and frigid winters

273
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,800
like Dublin its energy demand is

274
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,040
dominated by natural gas for heating but

275
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,079
unlike Dublin it already has a largely

276
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,320
decarbonized electric grid with a high

277

penetration of Renewables for the

278
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,880
analysis the Middlebury team chose to

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,320
focus on an aging residential

280
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,560
neighborhood similar to many that

281
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,440
surround the city core the shallow

heat pumps for space Heating and the

reduction from the Baseline by 2030 and

288
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,639
Net Zero carbon by 2050 results of the

289
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,760
analyses showed that implementing the

290
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,360
shallow retrofit scenario won't achieve

291
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,440
the 2030 Target the Deep retrofit

292
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,880
scenario would get the city to the 2030

293
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,040
Target but not to the 2050 Target indeed

294
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,120
even with the Deep retrofits fossil fuel

295
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,800
use remains High the explanation while

296
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,760
both retrofit scenarios call for

297
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,560
installing heat pumps for space heating

298
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,160
the city would continue to use natural

299
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,959
gas to heat its hot

300
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,680
water Lessons Learned for several policy

301
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,279
makers seeing the results of their

302
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,839
analyses was a wake-up call they learned

303
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,279
that the strategies they had planned

304
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
might not be sufficient to meet their

305
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,200
stated goals an outcome that could prove

306
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,839
publicly embarrassing for them in the

307
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,040
future like the policy makers the

308
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,839
researchers learned from The Experience

309
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,720
Reinhardt notes three main takeaways

310
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,639
first he and his team were surprised to

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
find how much of a building's energy use

312
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,360
in carbon emissions can be traced to

313
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
domestic hot water water with

314
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,440
middleberry for example even switching

315
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,880
from natural gas to heat pumps for space

316
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,639
heating didn't yield the expected effect

317
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,360
on the bar graphs generated by their

318
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
analyses the gray bars indicated carbon

319
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
from fossil fuel use remained as

320
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,040
Reinhardt recalls I kept saying what's

321
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,120
all this gray while the policy makers

322
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,760
talked about using heat pumps they were

323
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,920
still going to use natural gas to heat

324
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,360
their hot water it's just stunning that

325
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,320
hot water is such a big ticket item it's

326
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,720
huge says Reinhardt second the results

327
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,519
demonstrate the importance of including

328
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
the state of the local electric grid in

329
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,519
this type of analysis looking at the

330
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,680
results it's clear that if we want to

331
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,440
have a successful energy transition the

332
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,279
building sector and the electric grid

333
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,440
sector both have to do their homework

334
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,120
notes Reinhardt moreover in many cases

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,399
reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 will

336
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,320
require not only a carbon free grid but

337
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,800
also all electric buildings third

338
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,440
Reinhardt was struck by how different

339
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,519
the bar graphs presenting results for

340
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,480
the eight cities look this really

341
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,920
celebrates uniqueness of different parts

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,199
of the world he says the physics used in

343
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,920
the analysis is the same everywhere but

344
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,199
differences in the climate the building

345
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,480
stock construction practices electric

346
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,519
grids and other factors make the

347
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,560
consequences of making the same change

348
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
vary widely in addition says Reinhardt

349
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,760
there are sometimes deeply ingrained

350
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
conflicts of interest in cultural norms

351
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,600
which is why you cannot just say

352
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,160
everybody should do this and do this for

353
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,120
instance in one case the city owned both

354
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,639
the utility and the natural gas at Bur

355
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,600
burned as a result the policy makers

356
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,160
didn't consider putting in heat pumps

357
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,440
because the natural gas was a

358
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,760
significant source of Municipal income

359
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
and they didn't want to give that up

360
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,720
explains Reinhardt finally the analyses

361
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,959
Quantified two other important measures

362
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,839
energy use and Peak load which is the

363
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,000
maximum electricity demanded from the

364
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,519
grid over a specific time period

365
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,399
Reinhardt says that energy use is

366
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
probably mostly a possibility check does

367
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,120
this make sense and Peak load is

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,920
important because the utilities need to

369
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,320
keep a stable grid middleburry analysis

370
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
provides an interesting look at how

371
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,040
certain measures could influence Peak

372
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,720
electricity demand there the

373
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,639
introduction of electric heat pumps for

374
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
space heating more than doubles the peak

375
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,839
demand from buildings suggesting that

376
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,279
substantial additional capacity would

377
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,560
have to be added to the Grid in that

378
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,519
region but when heat pumps are combined

379
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
with other retrofitting measures the

380
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,680
peak demand drops to levels lower than

381
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
the starting

382
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,000
Baseline the aftermath an update

383
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,160
Reinhardt stresses that the specific

384
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,320
results from the workshop provide justce

385
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,360
shot in time that is where the cities

386
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,680
were at the time of the workshop this is

387
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,120
not the fate of the city he says if we

388
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,800
were to do the same exercise today we no

389
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,399
doubt see a change in thinking and the

390
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,399
outcomes would be different for example

391
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
heat bumps are now familiar technology

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,079
and have demonstrated their ability to

393
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,680
handle even bitterly cold climates and

394
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,759
in some regions they've become

395
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,040
economically attractive as the war in

396
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,800
Ukraine has made natural gas both scarce

397
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,240
and expensive also there's now awareness

398
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
of the need to deal with hot water

399
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,160
production Reinhardt notes that

400
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,160
performing the analyses of the workshop

401
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,000
did have the intended impact it brought

402
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,800
about change 2 years after the project

403
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,320
had ended most of the Cities reported

404
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
that they had implemented new policy

405
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,240
measures or had expanded their analysis

406
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,399
across the entire building stock that's

407
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,519
exactly what we want comments Reinhardt

408
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,399
this is not an academic exercise it's

409
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,440
meant to change what people focus on and

410
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,680
what they do designing policies with

411
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,600
socioeconomics in mind Reinhardt notes a

412
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,160
key limitation of the uban .io approach

413
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,800
it looks only at technical feasibility

414
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,480
but will the building owners be willing

415
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,880
and able to make the energy saving

416
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,079
retrofits data show that even with

417
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,160
today's incentive programs and subsidies

418
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,120
current adoption rates are only about 1%

419
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,800
that's way too low to enable a city to

420
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,160
achieve its emission reduction goals in

421
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,480
30 years says Reinhardt we need to take

422
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,600
into account the socioeconomic realities

423
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,399
of the residents to design policies that

424
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,600
are both effective and Equitable to that

425
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,240
end the MIT team extended their u.io

426
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,680
approach to create a socio

427
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,279
technoeconomic analysis framework that

428
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,319
can predict the rate of retrofit

429
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,319
adoption throughout a city based on

430
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,440
Census Data the framework creates an

431
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,680

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,360
specific types of buildings in a city

433
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,120
accounting for the cost of making a

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,839
specific retrofit PLUS Financial

households sample analyses for two

440
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,839
Boston Neighborhood neighb hoods suggest

441
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,319
that high income households are largely

442
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,759
ineligible for need-based incentives or

443
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,319
the incentives are insufficient to

444
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,079
prompt action lower inome households are

445
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,720
eligible and could benefit financially

446
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,759
over time but they don't act perhaps due

447
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,199
to limited access to information a lack

448
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,600
of time or capital or a variety of other

449
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,880
reasons Reinhardt notes that their work

450
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,279
thus far is mainly looking at technical

451
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,480
feasibility next steps are to better

452
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,040
understand occupants willingness to pay

453
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,800
and then to determine what set of

454
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,480
federal and local incentive programs

455
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,600
will trigger households across the

demographic Spectrum to retrofit their
