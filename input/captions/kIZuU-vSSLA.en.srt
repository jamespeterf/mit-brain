1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,290
OK, folks, we are
going to get started

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,620
with this breakout session,
as we continue this fantastic

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,700
day of science and engineering
here at MIT, for the HEALS

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,110
Initiative.

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,460
I am delighted to get
to introduce and share

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,190
the biosphere breakout
session today.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,730
My name is Matt Shoulders.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm a professor of
chemistry, and really

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,370
happy to see all of you here
for this important topic.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,857
You made your way
all the way over.

12
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,190
We really, really appreciate it.

13
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,690
And it's a beautiful
new space here,

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,710
so I hope you're enjoying it.

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,040
Today, I'll start with just a
few brief comments of my own

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,260
and then hand it
over to a fantastic

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,270
cast of four speakers
whose names you

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,600
can see on the prior slide.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,960
But we'll introduce
them along the way,

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,510
to tell you about the topics.

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,150
To tell you about
really amazing research

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,540
and the future of this field.

23
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,400
Understanding how living
systems power life on Earth.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,880
And I'm really excited
to hear their talks.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,060
When the talks are done--
and this is important--

26
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,030
when the talks are
done, we're planning

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,070
to have about 15 minutes,
10 to 15 minutes for a panel

28
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,010
discussion.

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,540
That's why we have chairs here.

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,840
So think about the
questions that you

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,260
want to ask these
fantastic faculty,

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,650
because if you don't, I'll
have to ask all the questions

33
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,650
and your questions will
be far more interesting.

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,300
So we'll have time
for that afterwards.

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,660
OK, so why do we have
a biosphere breakout

36
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,050
at the MIT Health and Life
Sciences Collaborative?

37
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,190
I hope and think that the
answer should actually

38
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,270
be obvious, right?

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,620
But the interface between
life sciences and health

40
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,290
is critically important.

41
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,090
But the health of people, the
health of the environment,

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,930
the health of the globe, the
health of the planet, life

43
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,260
sciences are central to
solving the major problems

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,070
that health in all those
spheres depends on.

45
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,290
Life sciences are absolutely
central to solving

46
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,980
the key challenges that we face.

47
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,430
So these range, of
course, from rapid climate

48
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,740
change that we have
to adapt to, and we

49
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,230
have to figure out how
to also halt or slow.

50
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,600
Life sciences are
these challenges

51
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,350
that face the life sciences,
including enormous increases

52
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,930
in demand for food, for
resilient agriculture,

53
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,370
and for healthy food.

54
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:36,350
We also face the damage done
to deteriorating environments,

55
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,020
and the effects on well-being
caused by all of that.

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,410
And really, the
life sciences are

57
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,830
key to solving these challenges.

58
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,840
Whether you talk about
synthetic biology,

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,300
plant science, microbiology,
environmental science, ecology,

60
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,850
the viable solutions, the
globally deployable solutions

61
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,240
to these types of challenges,
to the health of our world

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,250
and the health of
humans are going

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,910
to come in a meaningful
way from the life sciences.

64
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,510
And we also, along the way, as
we come up with these solutions,

65
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,050
we have to think about
ethical and equitable means

66
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,210
of deployment right
from the start

67
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,620
as we think about
inventing these solutions.

68
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,550
So MIT is a leader
in this space.

69
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,290
You've been hearing about lots
of amazing biomedical research

70
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,470
and tremendous
discoveries being made.

71
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,650
But at this interface
between the life sciences

72
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,170
and the biosphere, the life
sciences and the climate,

73
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,480
life sciences in
agriculture, there's

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,260
also huge opportunities
for impact on health.

75
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,820
In fact, even sort of small
incremental improvements

76
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,440
in these spaces
can have the sort

77
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,820
of massive effect on human
health and planetary health that

78
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,430
would elude most types
of drugs that you

79
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,700
could dream of inventing.

80
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,810
So we think this is super
important, super relevant

81
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,972
to the HEALS Initiative.

82
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,930
And today, you're going
to hear from these four

83
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,980
faculty about both
challenges and solutions

84
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,370
to problems at this
interface between life

85
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,920
sciences and the environment
and sustainability.

86
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,520
And you're going to hear them.

87
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,910
You're going to hear them
talk about challenges

88
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,710
that are facing our globe.

89
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,810
And all the way down to
individual communities.

90
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,890
And the talks today
are going to start

91
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,620
at the molecular
scale, as we first

92
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,260
start by talking
about photosynthesis

93
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,240
and the basics of
photosynthesis and how

94
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,200
it powers the entire planet.

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,830
How we can maybe
understand it better

96
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,590
and improve on it to
find great solutions.

97
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,190
We'll go from the molecular
scale to the scale of crops,

98
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,870
and actually providing
food for the world.

99
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,700
We'll talk also today
about how the changing

100
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,130
climate and the interface
between the climate

101
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,100
and green spaces plays
huge impacts, has

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,690
huge impacts on human health,
and human health equity as well.

103
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,290
And then finally,
at the end, we'll

104
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,510
go back to the global
scale and we'll

105
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,300
think about how tiny
microorganisms play

106
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,960
a huge role on Earth.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,130
And it's a very fascinating
area there as well.

108
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,310
You're in for some
great treat here

109
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,250
with these four
wonderful faculty,

110
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,050
and I should get off the stage
so you can hear from them.

111
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,110
Our first speaker is Professor
Gabriela Schlau-Cohen.

112
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,300
She's the Robert T.
Haslam and Bradley

113
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,836
Dewey, Professor of Chemistry.

114
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,251
[APPLAUSE]

115
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:30,950

116
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,450
All right.

117
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,800
Well, thank you, Matt.

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,170
And thanks to all of you who
made this journey over to this--

119
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,260
enjoyed this view
and these talks.

120
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,390
So Matt introduced
us to photosynthesis,

121
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,160
and photosynthesis occurs in
a wide variety of organisms

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,410
and a wide variety
of environments

123
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,090
to collectively generate
energy on an enormous scale.

124
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,080
Now, behind this feat is a
series of remarkable features.

125
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,580
For example, if we take this
corn and this crop field

126
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,690
here, one question that you
may have wondered yourself,

127
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,120
and is actually a central
question in research

128
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,290
in my group, is why is it
that plants like this one

129
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,750
don't get sunburned?

130
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,850
So plants don't have to put on
SPF 50 when they go outside.

131
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,050
They stay in the sun all day.

132
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,530
But yet, except in a
few limiting cases,

133
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,320
they don't get sunburn.

134
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,200
Now, the reason for this is
they have their own built

135
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
in molecular machinery.

136
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,490
It serves the
function of sunscreen.

137
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,510
In my group, we're interested
in understanding the mechanisms

138
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,800
behind this molecular machinery,
both for fundamental knowledge

139
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,890
and because of this plot here.

140
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,430
Shown are yields
for four major cash

141
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,770
crops as a function of time.

142
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,070
And what we can see
over the next decades

143
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,020
with predicted demand
in dotted lines

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,820
and predicted supply
in dashed ones,

145
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,110
is that there is a
growing mismatch.

146
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,100
And not having enough food is
a huge issue for human health.

147
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,040
It turns out we need to eat.

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,830
And so that means that
one of the biggest health

149
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,280
challenges facing us is figuring
out how to bridge this gap,

150
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,080
so the supply meets the demand.

151
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,830
One way to do that is
to increase the supply.

152
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,700
Fundamentally, the food supply
comes from photosynthesis.

153
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,590
But photosynthesis operates
at a measly 1% to 3%

154
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,320
efficiency for biomass
or food generation,

155
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,290
with the rest of
the energy getting

156
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,910
lost to things like metabolic
processes, inefficiencies

157
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,190
or environmental responses.

158
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,990
For example, under certain
conditions, up to 70%

159
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,320
of the absorbed light gets
converted to heat and lost.

160
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,520
This is that sunscreen
process that I was telling you

161
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,290
about before.

162
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,800
And so in many
conditions, it's actually

163
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,880
that conversion to heat
that limits crop yields.

164
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,490
So if we want to
understand this energy

165
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:21,050
allocation and these limits, we
can go back to our crop field.

166
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,800
And we can zoom in.

167
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,270
And what we find are some of the
most sophisticated nanomachines

168
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,190
on Earth.

169
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,169
These are the photosynthetic
super complexes

170
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,039
that collectively
capture light and then

171
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,500
convert that light
into chemical fuels.

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,530
These chemical fuels are then
used for biomass generation.

173
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,410
Now, even in the first
steps of this process,

174
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,120
this energy allocation
is already occurring.

175
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,070
Specifically, this is where we
see the allocation of energy

176
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,340
into these environmental
responses converted to heat

177
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,020
and lost.

178
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,440
But the size of these
slices of pie, they

179
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,730
actually change
with many factors.

180
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,960
And there's been decades of work
in plant biology, spectroscopy,

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,230
plant science, that have
all led us to understand

182
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,350
that, for example, with
something like weather,

183
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,870
this amount can
decrease dramatically.

184
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,990
But if what we want
to do is understand

185
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,010
what it is that's
controlling this,

186
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,530
so we can begin to think
about manipulation,

187
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,390
we really want to understand the
specific proteins responsible.

188
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,630
So, for example, in
green algae and moss,

189
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,460
these are good model systems for
understanding energy allocation

190
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,300
in green plants in general.

191
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,500
The specific protein responsible
is one that looks like this.

192
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,950
Here's the structural model.

193
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,100
It's called light harvesting
complex stress related,

194
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,280
or LHCSR.

195
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,690
This is a protein that
actually takes that sunlight

196
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,240
and converts it into heat.

197
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,250
And the level of that conversion
gets controlled by that protein

198
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,030
by structural or
conformational changes.

199
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,080
So if what we need to
understand is energy allocation

200
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,140
in photosynthesis,
what we want to know

201
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,280
is what is the conformational
switch in proteins

202
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,960
like this one that activate the
dissipation of energy as heat.

203
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,710
And so if we want to understand
this dissipation of energy

204
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,290
as heat, a really important
reporter is fluorescence.

205
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,330
So fluorescence is
something that's

206
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,240
used to study photosynthesis
on all sorts of length scales.

207
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,420
This is a wide
interdisciplinary community.

208
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,710
So what happens is proteins
like this one absorb light.

209
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,540
The amount of light
that comes in then

210
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,450
can come back out
as fluorescence.

211
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,530
So the more light that
comes out, the less energy

212
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,840
is getting converted
into heat and vice versa.

213
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,460
Now based on this
inverse relationship,

214
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,780
this is how fluorescence is
used to study photosynthesis.

215
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,750
And like I said, on many
different length scales,

216
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,080
from the kind of individual
proteins experiments

217
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,560
that we do in my group, all
the way up to the global scale

218
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,740
where fluorescence is measured
in satellites from space.

219
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,150
And that really allows us to
connect these different scales

220
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,940
using these different approaches
to understand energy allocation.

221
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,970
But say we want to understand
these individual proteins

222
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,680
and this conformational
switch, that question.

223
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,230
I posed before.

224
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,460
Well, one challenge in a
typical biochemical experiment

225
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,840
is we may take proteins like
this one and measure around 10

226
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,440
to the fourth individual
proteins at a time.

227
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,490
Well, the challenge with
that kind of experiment

228
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,980
is that each one
of those proteins

229
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,920
may not be in the
same conformation

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,600
or may actually be undergoing
a conformational change.

231
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,090
And so experiments
had traditionally

232
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,690
averaged over this, making
it impossible to identify

233
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,290
these conformations and the
different energy allocation.

234
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,210
Now, it's because
of that limitation

235
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,460
that over the past
decades, single molecule,

236
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,070
or in this case, single
protein spectroscopy,

237
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,990
has emerged as a powerful tool.

238
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,500
This is one of the major tools
that we use in my research

239
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,430
group, where we can zoom in and
measure the fluorescence of one

240
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,490
protein, and then
another and then another,

241
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,470
to collectively understand all
of their fluorescent properties.

242
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,470
So here's an example of
some data from my lab

243
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,620
where we look at the
fluorescence distribution.

244
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,420
And so what we see are
two peaks, one of which,

245
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,920
whereas more of light harvesting
confirmation, and the other

246
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,130
is our dissipative confirmation,
where the energy is

247
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,580
being converted to heat.

248
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,930
So this one has less
fluorescence coming out.

249
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,920
And so this data was taken under
conditions that mimic low light.

250
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,590
But we can change how
we're doing our experiment,

251
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,750
understand how energy allocation
in photosynthesis changes.

252
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,390
And so if we do the same
thing, mimicking high light,

253
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,900
what we see is a change
in our distribution

254
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,390
and an increase in
the level of energy

255
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,280
going to heat by around 50%.

256
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,300
So more energy gets lost.

257
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,550
So collectively, this allowed
us to identify these two peaks

258
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,890
and see how this
switch gets turned.

259
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,490
So we now have
this understanding

260
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,680
of these individual protein
conformations, how they change,

261
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,230
and how they're
controlling energy

262
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,080
allocation in photosynthesis.

263
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,380
And so with this fundamental
understanding of the protein

264
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,600
level properties,
we can now begin

265
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,320
to think about that gives us a
blueprint for what's happening

266
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,130
in organisms like this one.

267
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,710
So we can think about
reallocating this,

268
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,260
redistributing the energy
potentially to increase biomass,

269
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,490
and maybe even one day
increase our crop yields.

270
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,090

271
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,430
And with that, I'm
going to turn it over

272
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,230
to our next speaker
who will talk

273
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,680
about continuing to think about
how to change these organisms.

274
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,269
Dave Des Marais from Civil
and Environmental Engineering.

275
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:40,764
[APPLAUSE]

276
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:45,760

277
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,590
Thanks, Gabriella.

278
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:51,160
So I'm a plant biologist, and
so Gabriella has just given you

279
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,910
a fantastic introduction to one
of the most amazing and central

280
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,540
things that plants do for
the entire biosphere, which

281
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,310
is to take solar energy that's
abundant but transient source

282
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,820
of energy, and to capture that
energy through the process

283
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,460
of photosynthesis,
interacting with CO2,

284
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,810
with water to make sugars.

285
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,380
And as probably even most
elementary school students know,

286
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
the other thing, of course,
that comes from this

287
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,420
is also very important
for the biosphere, which

288
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
is oxygen, biomedical
oxygen, which we can breathe

289
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,220
and which allows
respiration to be

290
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,050
such an efficient process for
harvesting and using energy.

291
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,870
So what I like to teach
my introductory students

292
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,770
in biology, that we're taking
this transient source of energy

293
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,340
and we're trapping that as the
bonds in the sugar molecules,

294
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,840
right?

295
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,480
So now we have this physical
thing that a plant or an animal

296
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,092
can use to transport,
to move around,

297
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:51,800
to use as energy when
they would like to.

298
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,370
Not necessarily when
the sun is shining.

299
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,210
But as you probably know, sugars
play a second equally important

300
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,730
role, which is those
initially fixed

301
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,820
carbon molecules form the
backbone of everything else.

302
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,770
And I literally mean
everything else.

303
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,080
Everything that the
plant makes, everything

304
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,840
that an animal might eat
from that plant, everything

305
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,870
that a fungus might use as
it decomposes that plant, all

306
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,110
of those organic biomolecules
begin as carbon photosynthate.

307
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,920
But there's also very
important other molecules

308
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,870
that are part of that
fixation process.

309
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,290
So you know we need
to eat protein,

310
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,850
because protein contains
things like nitrogen and iron.

311
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,560
Our lipids, of course,
are often very complex,

312
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,240
large macromolecules.

313
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,990
And not only the composition
of those molecules

314
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,850
depends upon other nutrients,
but also the processes

315
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,270
to generate those molecules.

316
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,030
The very action of
doing photosynthesis

317
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,730
requires all sorts of
interesting elements

318
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,340
that are largely
gained from the soil.

319
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,820
So what is the ultimate source
of those important components?

320
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,580
Well, there's many, many
elements that organisms need.

321
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,260
Plants and us.

322
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,150
Nitrogen is often
was thought about,

323
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,480
but there's also countless
mineral molecules.

324
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,970
Where do those come from?

325
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,790
Well, ultimately, those
are weathered off of rocks.

326
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,829
There are abundant
sources of many

327
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,690
of these minerals
in the lithosphere

328
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,130
and as rocks weather,
those enter the soils,

329
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,290
those can be captured by
the biosphere, by capture,

330
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,030
by plants and microbes
to build their biomass.

331
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,790
Nitrogen is also
incredibly abundant

332
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,800
but is abundant
in our atmosphere

333
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,440
as nitrogen gas, N2 gas.

334
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,267
And you may know that nitrogen
gas is incredibly hard

335
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,100
to break apart those
two nitrogen molecules.

336
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,058
But breaking apart those
two nitrogen molecules

337
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:39,710
is critical to
turn that nitrogen

338
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,060
into usable forms of nutrients
like ammonia nitrate, which

339
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,320
plants can uptake,
turn into proteins,

340
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,690
thus providing us
with a food source.

341
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,180
Now in natural
communities, which

342
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,580
I have grown up studying as
an evolutionary biologist

343
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,820
and ecologist, in
natural communities where

344
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,390
plants and animals and microbes
are found and where they thrive

345
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,660
is really a function of
what's in those environments.

346
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,978
If there's rocks nearby
that can weather out

347
00:18:05,978 --> 00:18:08,520
these important minerals, well,
then the kinds of plants that

348
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,700
can make use of those minerals
or that do well when they're

349
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,590
in excess or in deficit, and
similarly, for nitrogen, where

350
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,090
there's enough
nitrogen in the soil,

351
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,090
there's plants that will
thrive in those places.

352
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,798
And if they don't
thrive in those places,

353
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,330
in those natural
communities, well,

354
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,150
then they can move someplace
else, or they might go extinct.

355
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,370
So natural communities
have evolved

356
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,070
over hundreds of thousands
and millions of years

357
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,710
to have compositions
of plants and animals

358
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,410
and fungi that
form the biosphere.

359
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,443
Some plants die, they rot.

360
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:37,860
They create nutrients
for microbes

361
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,670
which produce and sort of
continue the cycle of life.

362
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,160
But in agricultural
systems, we don't

363
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,590
have that same nice
balance, unfortunately.

364
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,200
It's not simply a matter of
having the plants grow someplace

365
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,158
else, because we want to
have those plants grow

366
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:53,950
at very high yield,
in the places where

367
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,360
we need them to be growing.

368
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,420
And so that creates a real
problem when any of these things

369
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,520
become out of balance.

370
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,190
And this has led to what
has been called the nitrogen

371
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,030
problem.

372
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,000
So we know that nitrogen is a
key limiting nutrient for most

373
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,370
of our agricultural production.

374
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,990
Most of our calories
in the world

375
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,050
come from cereals, either that
we eat directly, corn and wheat,

376
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,153
or that we feed to our animals,
which we then eat the animals.

377
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,320
And to maintain these very
high yields from cereals,

378
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,300
we need to have a lot
of nitrogen fertilizer.

379
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,340
As I told you, those
things can become limiting.

380
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,380
If you imagine a common
agricultural year,

381
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,800
you're pulling up all that
biomass, you're shipping it off

382
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
and the nitrogen
is going with it.

383
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,910
So we're constantly adding more
and more nitrogen fertilizer

384
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,200
back to the soil.

385
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,770
The predominant source of the
nitrogen in the developed world

386
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,980
is through industrial
fixation of nitrogen

387
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,670
through the Haber-Bosch process.

388
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,790
Here's a few figures to
make the point to you

389
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,250
that this is an incredibly
resource intensive process

390
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,020
to capture that
atmospheric nitrogen

391
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,920
and turn it into ammonia that
we can feed to our plants.

392
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,440
So just huge proportions of
the total global carbon budget

393
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,470
come from the process of
making industrial nitrogen.

394
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,870
But even more
depressing is that most

395
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,370
of the nitrogen we
put onto our soil

396
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,380
doesn't end up in our plants and
doesn't end up in us as food.

397
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,140
It's running off, or
it's being lost back

398
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,940
to the atmosphere as
climate changing gases.

399
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,668
So this is the nitrogen problem.

400
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:14,210
Now, you're probably
aware that there

401
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,530
are plants out there that have,
in a sense, figured this out.

402
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,140
So in places where nitrogen
in the soil is very limiting,

403
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,630
microbes can fix that
nitrogen. Atmospheric nitrogen.

404
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,160
And many plants
have figured out how

405
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,180
to coexist with those microbes
and make use of that nitrogen.

406
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,680
So there's this
really nice exchange

407
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,300
of carbon from the plant and
nitrogen from the microbes.

408
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,350
And of course, legumes like
soybeans and many other beans

409
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,150
are the most famous
and widespread example

410
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,910
of this in our food system.

411
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,327
But cereals don't
have this trick.

412
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,743
They don't have-- and they
haven't figured out how to have

413
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,660
that symbiosis, how to get these
relationships with microbes

414
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,750
to provide nitrogen. So this has
really been sort of a moonshot

415
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,508
genetic engineering project
since at least the 1970s.

416
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:58,550
And a number of proposals
have been brought forth

417
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,430
about how we might try to
introduce this nitrogen capture

418
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,510
process into our cereal crops.

419
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,238
So at base, what
this issue is, is

420
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:10,280
how do we get the nitrogen
out of the atmosphere,

421
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,120
into a microbe, and into the
plants we want those microbes

422
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,500
to be associated with?

423
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,210
And in turn, what
is the plant then

424
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,370
giving back to those
microbes in exchange

425
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,650
for this resource, this
valuable, energetically

426
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,030
intensive resource capture?

427
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,860
So this is the central question.

428
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,800
And this is a
question, a challenge

429
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,590
that we've been tackling as
part of the MIT Climate Grand

430
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,320
Challenge Program, led by Chris
Voigt, a number of faculty

431
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,960
from across the Institute
where we're trying to address

432
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,975
this nutrient use in agriculture
problem in a very holistic way.

433
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,600
And what I want to
share with you today

434
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
is a small piece
of that project,

435
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,180
which is trying to optimize this
particular little interaction.

436
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,890
How do we get those microbes
to capture the nitrogen,

437
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,610
give it to the plants that
we want them to give it to,

438
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,550
under the conditions that we
need them to do so, and then

439
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,800
have the microbes in a sense
cultivated by the plants.

440
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,830
So Professor Chris Voight
here in MIT's bioengineering

441
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,320
department, is really focusing
on this first question.

442
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,720
How do we genetically
engineer bacteria

443
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,200
to fix the nitrogen when and
where we need them to do it?

444
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,330
My group is really interested
in the plant side of this.

445
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,720
My group is comprised of
plant physiologists, plant

446
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,820
geneticists, and we
think very deeply

447
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,000
about how plant performance
is driven and affected

448
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,740
by environmental conditions
and environmental change.

449
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,240
And one thing we've
been focusing on

450
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,115
in the last few years
is trying to understand

451
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:34,060
under what conditions
do plants provide

452
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,210
these cheap carbohydrates,
organic acids and sugars

453
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,160
to the microbes in the soil.

454
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,450
Is there genetic
variation in this process?

455
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,070
How does the
environment drive this?

456
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,310
And critically,
could we understand

457
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:50,280
at a mechanistic level how
to manipulate that process?

458
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,660
These are some really key
questions we're interested in.

459
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,060
What molecules are
there being produced?

460
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,100
Does the environment
drive this process?

461
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,560
And critically,
can we manipulate

462
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,460
the production of what
we call these accidents?

463
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,310
Now to do this requires
a tremendous amount

464
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,170
of technological know how.

465
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,893
So we're looking at roots,
so they're below ground.

466
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:10,310
We can't just walk
up to the plant

467
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,650
and measure them without
disrupting itself.

468
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,590
So we're collaborating
with a Professor Sixian You

469
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,200
here in MIT's research lab
for electronics and EECS,

470
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,330
who's developed non-label,
non-invasive imaging

471
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,200
technologies for living tissue,
where we can look at the roots

472
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
in situ, as they're growing,
and look at their metabolism,

473
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,157
look at their chemistry,
look, see how they're

474
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,590
growing at the cellular level.

475
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,650
And my PhD student,
Chloe Heitmeyer,

476
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,790
has developed a
very simple system

477
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,790
to grow these plants under
controlled conditions

478
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,560
where we can actually
then image them

479
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,350
in situ, and critically
sample those exudates

480
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,830
from living plants.

481
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,050
So as I introduced
the beginning,

482
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,310
I'm a plant biologist, right?

483
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,650
And when I talk to my
colleagues at the universities,

484
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,025
they say, well,
what on Earth are

485
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:56,630
you doing in this environmental
engineering department at MIT?

486
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,280
And this is what I'm doing here.

487
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,228
The opportunity to collaborate
with electrical engineers

488
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,270
and to recruit the best
PhD students in the world

489
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,410
to come and work in the
lab is why we're here.

490
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,650
It's this interdisciplinary
fearlessness

491
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,890
that I think so many of us
here at MIT bring to the table.

492
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,550
And I hope that we can use
this integrative approach

493
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,130
to tackle this very
simple, very complex,

494
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,180
mechanistic problem in a
way that we can hopefully

495
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,140
advance food security and
ultimately human health.

496
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,130
So with that, I'd like to
introduce Professor Janelle

497
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,650
Knox-Hayes who is a professor
of economic geography

498
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,100
and the planning head for MIT
architecture and planning.

499
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,110

500
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,260
All right.

501
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,100
All right.

502
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,160
Good afternoon, everyone.

503
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,030
And thank you so much for
joining this panel today.

504
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,190
I'm going to present
some research that's

505
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,880
looking at the interface,
taking a scale out

506
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,640
at the city level, the
interface of climate

507
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,980
impacts like extreme heat
and health dimensions.

508
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,890
And so this is based
out of work that

509
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,930
was completed a
couple of summers

510
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,150
ago in the height of
the COVID pandemic,

511
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,100
with Cynthia Rosenzweig at
Columbia University and Juan

512
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,360
Camilo Osorio at
Pratt University.

513
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,870
And we were really
interested in understanding

514
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,580
what was happening
with the pandemic

515
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,090
and how city officials could
respond to interventions

516
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,420
such as extreme heat in the
summer of 2020, and 2021,

517
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,320
when the pandemic cases
were at their highest.

518
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,470
But people were not able
to be brought together

519
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,010
into cooling centers.

520
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,620
A lot of public infrastructure
wasn't operational.

521
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,710
And so we wanted to
look at those dynamics

522
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,930
and see how extreme
heat is really

523
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,880
factor of a range of different,
not just natural conditions,

524
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,440
but built environmental,
socio-environmental conditions.

525
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,120
So our questions
for the study were,

526
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,270
what are the places of highest
risk in heat for COVID?

527
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,420
And we focused on
New York City in part

528
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,490
because Cynthia and Juan Camilo
are based in New York City.

529
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,940
We had really good access
through their network works

530
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,390
to a range of data, including
COVID health data and then

531
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,320
also this satellite imagery.

532
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,610
But New York City was
also the ground zero

533
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,930
of the pandemic for
the United States.

534
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,470
And what we quickly discovered
is that the pandemic

535
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,910
unfolded in waves.

536
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,570
And we could track those waves.

537
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,150
They were very distinct
within New York City.

538
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,810
So we basically mapped
three waves of the pandemic,

539
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,320
and that allowed us to
look at the relationship

540
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,590
between the environmental, the
built social infrastructure

541
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,570
and the sociodemographic
characteristics.

542
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,120
And then we also
wanted to understand

543
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,905
the neighborhoods that were
most impacted by COVID-19.

544
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,280
We were able to
show that there's

545
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,210
a direct correspondence with
compound risks of extreme heat.

546
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,280
And while it's not yet
published in this work,

547
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,930
we also looked at factors like
flood risk and air quality risk

548
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,790
and show that those
risks, they're compound.

549
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,310
If you're vulnerable
to one of these risks,

550
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,130
you tend to be vulnerable
to all of them.

551
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,700
And so in sum, we're looking at
a range of economic inequality,

552
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,060
health, built
environmental factors,

553
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,490
and natural environmental
factors, including

554
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,350
heat, extreme--

555
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,210
or sorry, extreme heat,
air quality and flooding,

556
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,140
and creating a compound
risk index for the city

557
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,530
that they can use to make
different planning decisions.

558
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,890
So there's a lot of data here.

559
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,320
I know I don't
have a lot of time

560
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,460
to try to walk
through this, but I'm

561
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,890
going to try to walk through
some of the key findings

562
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,410
from each of the
waves of the pandemic

563
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,480
and then look at
our index and how

564
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,180
that can shape different
public understandings of how

565
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,260
to respond to things
like the COVID pandemic.

566
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,470
So the unique challenge,
again, the cooling strategies

567
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,540
such as cooling centers, did
not meet the physical distancing

568
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,230
requirements of COVID.

569
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,380
Vulnerable communities had
less access to green space.

570
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,780
The other scientists
on the panel

571
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,630
have been talking about how
significant different factors

572
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,800
of plants are for generating
food, for remediating heat,

573
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,880
for generating energy.

574
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,720
And we absolutely saw that
in terms of vulnerabilities

575
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,350
to COVID-19.

576
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,450
We know a lot about
the impact of crowding

577
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,170
in the spread of respiratory
illnesses like COVID-19,

578
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,510
and that there's a
general relationship

579
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,348
between density, urban
density and spread.

580
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:14,140
What was really
interesting about our data,

581
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,920
though, is we were able
to parse urban density

582
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,470
and show that the most
dense areas of New York City

583
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,820
actually weren't
the most vulnerable.

584
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,470
There are different
kinds of densities.

585
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,350
And so I'll walk through
what those results look like.

586
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,700
And then we looked at the
social determinants of health,

587
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,840
including racial dynamics.

588
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,340
We created a social
vulnerability factor index

589
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,370
that included things like
language, isolation, access

590
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,220
to resources, education
level, income level,

591
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,410
and compared that as
well with COVID cases.

592
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,720
So just to take a quick
look at New York City,

593
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,670
we're mapping the five Boroughs.

594
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,980
And I don't know if I
have a pointer on here.

595
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,580
Maybe I do.

596
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,080
Yeah.

597
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,510
Where we can see Bronx, Queens,
Brooklyn, Staten Island.

598
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,770
And then we combine for to
understand vulnerability

599
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,600
the first two waves,
because there's

600
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,940
different factors that occurred
across all three waves.

601
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,730
And the first wave,
initially people

602
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,250
were being told to stay
indoors, not to mask.

603
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,840
Later that was reversed, and we
realized actually being outside

604
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,560
is much better.

605
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,780
If the weather is good and you
have access to green space,

606
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,590
get out into fresh air, don't
be crowded into indoor spaces.

607
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,270
And masking became essential.

608
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,160
In the second wave
of the pandemic

609
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,530
there were lockdowns
across the cities.

610
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,800
And you can see here
the timing where we

611
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,460
were able to map each of these.

612
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,080
Sorry, my pointer isn't quite--

613
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,915
first wave between January and
July of 2020 was a summer wave.

614
00:29:39,915 --> 00:29:44,290
The second wave, between
August and July of 2021,

615
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,600
included the peak
in a winter wave.

616
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,390
And then between the second
and third waves, the biggest

617
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,080
intervention.

618
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,850
This is when the vaccinations
became available.

619
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,640
So you had a much
more extreme variant

620
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,360
of the virus in the third wave.

621
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,440
But the we'll look at how
vulnerability played out

622
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,350
through vaccinations.

623
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:04,850
All right.

624
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,420
So this study
design, really this

625
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,610
was taking inspiration from
an epidemiological study,

626
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,110
Madrigano, who created a
heat index for New York City

627
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,550
and creating a spatial
variation of that.

628
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,260
So our data are all associated.

629
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
We had more than 30 variables.

630
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,730
We associated them
spatially rather

631
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,620
than trying to think about cause
and effect of the pandemic.

632
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,200
We were looking at
spatial correspondence.

633
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,770
We created this
compound risk index

634
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,090
and then we evaluated
the interventions.

635
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,780
And the way we did this was
by combining the variables

636
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,230
into different factor groups.

637
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,230
So we looked at
vegetation density

638
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,280
to understand this
relationship of green space.

639
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,270
We looked at impervious
surface, because again, it's

640
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,050
not a matter of total density.

641
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,080
And you really in New
York City see that

642
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,650
with the impact of Manhattan.

643
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,920
Manhattan is incredibly
dense, but it

644
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,770
has, with Central Park in the
middle, really good access

645
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,987
to green space, and then other
sociodemographic conditions

646
00:30:57,987 --> 00:30:59,570
that made it less
vulnerable, at least

647
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,750
in the first and second
waves of the pandemic that

648
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,080
helped us create this idea of
a mixed density variable, which

649
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,790
we differentiated from
rental overcrowding.

650
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,860
So it's not just a
matter of density.

651
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,220
The mixed density in some
of the places in Manhattan,

652
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,030
it allows for this concept
of a 10 minute city.

653
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,800
People who are living
in those conditions

654
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,080
had access to childcare,
to food resources,

655
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,520
to quality green space.

656
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,970
They might be within 10
minutes of their workplace.

657
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,060
And that had a severe
impact or high impact

658
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,160
in reducing the
severity of COVID cases.

659
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,710
And then also the distance,
this was kind of critical,

660
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,470
especially for those that didn't
have access to air conditioning,

661
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,290
to public cooling.

662
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,340
And then finally, the
social vulnerability,

663
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,060
we combined different factors
to look at social vulnerability.

664
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,530
So some of the map
on the left here

665
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:53,490
shows the top 15 most
vulnerable neighborhoods.

666
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,340
And a lot of these
were widely reported

667
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,890
in the news, Kensington
Heights on the north.

668
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,360
And then I'm not sure why
this isn't quite working.

669
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,510
Corona was one of the most
impacted neighborhoods

670
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,510
in Queens, and then
Sunset Park in Brooklyn

671
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,010
were some of the areas that
were getting a lot of attention.

672
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,802
And one of the first
things that you notice

673
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:14,810
is the distance of
these neighborhoods

674
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,470
from quality green space.

675
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,560
So we used a number
of different factors

676
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,570
to map and measure
green space and look

677
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,940
at where our communities
and what kind of access

678
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,123
do they have.

679
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:25,790
And then this is,
again, quite different

680
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,780
from impervious surface.

681
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,430
It's one of the core
vulnerabilities.

682
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,960
You can see how physically
dense Manhattan is,

683
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,530
the relative impervious surface,
but that doesn't necessarily

684
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,690
correspond with
quality green space

685
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,230
because you have good
access to green space there.

686
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,010
I'm going to skip
through the regressions.

687
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,797
I think there's interesting
results in the paper,

688
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,380
if you're curious
to dig through that.

689
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,140
And just quickly highlight
some of the key findings.

690
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,650
In the first wave,
temperature and COVID-19 cases

691
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,030
concentrated in the
same neighborhoods.

692
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,120
So green space is not
only for mediating heat,

693
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,940
it's also for mitigating
the impact of the pandemic.

694
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,260
It was highly significant,
especially in this summer wave

695
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,780
where people needed access
to quality outdoor space.

696
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,760
Social vulnerability was highly
significant across all three

697
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,850
of the waves.

698
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,340
And again, for those
that are curious,

699
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,920
you really can see
this impact here.

700
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,390
There were really
interesting differences

701
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,180
across the waves for access
to cooling infrastructure,

702
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,720
as you can imagine with
significant lack of air

703
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,410
conditioning was significant
in predicting vulnerability.

704
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,540
And then of course,
distance to open

705
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,440
space and social vulnerability.

706
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,560
In the switch between the
first and second waves,

707
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,760
we identified a really
fascinating transition.

708
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,540
It was known that Black
and African-American

709
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,270
populations were particularly
vulnerable in the first wave.

710
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,510
Hispanic populations were
also particularly vulnerable,

711
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,200
but for whatever reason didn't
get the same level of media

712
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,230
coverage.

713
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,770
And we were able to
demonstrate with our data

714
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,480
a shift that occurred
between waves one and two

715
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,140
where that vulnerability
was largely addressed

716
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,850
for Black and African
populations in the second wave,

717
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,150
and it was not addressed
for whatever reason

718
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,460
for Hispanic populations.

719
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,570
We looked into the
employment records

720
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:23,690
and there's actually, for both
African-American and Hispanic

721
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,840
populations, a number
a higher majority

722
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,900
that are working in
essential services.

723
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,600
For the Black population,
that was primarily in transit.

724
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,330
For the Hispanic population,
that was primarily

725
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,449
in cleaning services.

726
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,780
So there may be
some factor there

727
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,150
that that's not fully
explained in our data that

728
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,639
should be looked into as
to why one population was

729
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,170
more vulnerable.

730
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,739
And then the rental
overcrowding.

731
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,730
We saw a huge impact
there with the difference

732
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,590
between rental overcrowding
and mixed density.

733
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,010
And so this map, I just
want to quickly illustrate

734
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,949
the differences here.

735
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,800
This is the first
wave mapped over

736
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,850
Black and African populations.

737
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,060
You can see how strong
the direct correspondence

738
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,920
between COVID cases
and those percentages.

739
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,000
And then this map
is the blue hashes

740
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,810
are showing the second wave
of the pandemic and Hispanic

741
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,690
populations.

742
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,190
And again, you see, especially
in Brooklyn and Queens, a shift

743
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,260
away from predominant Black
and African populations,

744
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,920
but the direct impact on
the Hispanic populations.

745
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,420
All right.

746
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,890
And I'm almost out of time.

747
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,340
I know there's so much
data in here to cover.

748
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,560
Rental overcrowding,
again, a huge

749
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,040
overlap in prediction with COVID
vulnerability, which was, again,

750
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,910
very different for mixed density
in the first and second waves.

751
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,960
What's interesting
is in the third wave,

752
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,940
we really see the impact
of the vaccination rate.

753
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,710
This had a profound shift
in moving the vulnerability.

754
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,570
So you see the
areas in Queens that

755
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,150
were deeply impacted in
the first and second wave,

756
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,170
are less impacted
in the third wave.

757
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,160
Manhattan finally had a bigger
impact in the third wave.

758
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,520
And this may be as a
consequence of people's

759
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,370
choices around vaccination
and where that was directed.

760
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,800
And so just to conclude,
I know I'm out of time,

761
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,820
but the way that we utilize this
is we combine all of the data

762
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,560
and created this risk
index for the city

763
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,640
so that they could see where the
areas that are most vulnerable.

764
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,190
This part, the oceanfront
areas around Long Island,

765
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,250
are very well understood
for flood risk, especially.

766
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,030
But this Back Bay
of New York was not

767
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,490
well understood, how vulnerable
these populations are here.

768
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,950
And then we went
through and looked

769
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,780
at the existing
interventions for heat,

770
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,340
open spaces, pools,
open and cool streets,

771
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,210
and mapped the correspondence
of areas that are high risk

772
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,370
and have low access to services.

773
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,610
The areas that are high
risk but have good access

774
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,470
to services, and
then the areas that

775
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,840
are low risk and low
distance to cooling,

776
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,980
and presented these
findings to the city

777
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,310
so that they could look at
mapping their interventions

778
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,010
and understanding where were
existing vulnerabilities

779
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,490
and where should they
better be targeted.

780
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:01,990
All right.

781
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,032
So I'll leave it at that.

782
00:37:03,032 --> 00:37:05,140
Thank you very much.

783
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,670
[INAUDIBLE] And happy to pass
it now to our next speaker

784
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,160
from Biology Institute,
Professor Penny Chisholm.

785
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,820
Thank you.

786
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,780

787
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,950
Thank you.

788
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,450
I have a couple of props here,
which I'll explain in a minute.

789
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,920
Well, it's sort of
obvious, but so I

790
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,960
am going to focus on the
big picture with this talk.

791
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,890
And we're going to go
back to photosynthesis.

792
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,370
What I'd like to do
is, first of all,

793
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,600
show you my favorite
slide on life on Earth.

794
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:48,110
And I'm going to describe
my passion for phytoplankton

795
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,060
over the last 40 years.

796
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,460
And I'm going to use that as an
example of how curiosity driven

797
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,480
research can yield really
interesting understanding

798
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,500
of life on Earth.

799
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,970
And this is just going to be
one organism I'm talking about,

800
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,190
and there are millions of others
that we should be studying.

801
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,450
So that's my pitch.

802
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:14,360
And then finally, I'll make a
big pitch for that, for MIT.

803
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,560
So first of all, life on Earth,
this is my abridged version.

804
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,340
We can't forget that
life all depends

805
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,790
on this process
of photosynthesis.

806
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,510
Well, there are some microbes
that can make biomass

807
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,000
from deep sea vents,
but if you track that,

808
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,160
they need oxygen, which
comes from the surface.

809
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,660
So all of life depends
on this photosynthesis,

810
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,360
taking solar energy, CO2 and
turning it into food and fiber,

811
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,840
and then all of the
organisms on Earth

812
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,490
that can't do that, take
that, we eat and we respire,

813
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,360
and use that chemical
energy to live.

814
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,420
And I feel so
passionate about this.

815
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,830
I actually collaborated
with a friend of mine.

816
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:05,260
We wrote a children's book
called Living Sunlight,

817
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,380
and it starts out-- it's
narrated by the sun--

818
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,710
and it starts out with
a child with its hand.

819
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,670
It said, the sun says, "Put your
hand on your heart and feel.

820
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,940
Feel your heart pumping.

821
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,110
Feel how warm you are.

822
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,850
That is my light inside of you."

823
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,480
And I showed this to a friend
of mine when we were drafting it

824
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,280
and she said, that's
a beautiful metaphor.

825
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,110
And I said, "It's
not a metaphor."

826
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,540
I said, "That is sunlight
energy in there."

827
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,190
And I just think it's so
important to think about that.

828
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,500
Because half of the MIT--

829
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,650
well, I digress.

830
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,960
But half of the MIT plant
scientists are in this room,

831
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,500
and we need more of them.

832
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,320
That's one of my messages.

833
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,936
OK.

834
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:53,860
So now on today's Earth,
these two reactions

835
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,050
are fairly balanced, roughly.

836
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,840
But if you integrate over
millions and millions of years,

837
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,780
there's more productivity
than there is respiration.

838
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,750
And we have this
fossil fuel, which

839
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,130
is basically ancient plants.

840
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,820
That's buried sunlight.

841
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,700
Another book over there.

842
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,900
And what we are doing
in this 150 years

843
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,490
is taking that and burning it,
same process there, respiration,

844
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,970
and that's the CO2 that's
increasing dramatically

845
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,230
in the atmosphere.

846
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,770
Hence climate change,
hence MIT's huge initiative

847
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,590
on climate.

848
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,800
So all of these initiatives
are in this one slide.

849
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,710
But today I'm going to
focus on that neglected

850
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,600
little green thing
up there, which

851
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,070
is the microscopic plants, the
phytoplankton, that do actually

852
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,890
roughly half of the
photosynthesis on Earth, if you

853
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,390
round up.

854
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,630
Maybe a little bit.

855
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,040
And you can't see
this very well,

856
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,370
but it's from another children's
book on the phytoplankton.

857
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:01,340
But there they are, these
little microscopic green plants.

858
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,420
It's in the upper 200
meters of the ocean.

859
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,610
This is roughly to scale.

860
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:09,750
And they feed all of the
life in the ocean ecosystem,

861
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,530
even the life in
the deeper waters.

862
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:19,860
And that is through the
settling of the biomass that

863
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,510
is not eaten in the surface.

864
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,170
We call this marine snow.

865
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,970
And so it's dead stuff
and mucus and everything

866
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,280
that's colonized by bacteria.

867
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,730
And as it settles, of course,
there's no photosynthesis down

868
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,290
there, so there's no
consumption of carbon dioxide,

869
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,760
but there's respiration.

870
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,670
So the bacteria are
respiring carbon dioxide.

871
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:44,170
And what that does is it sets
up this concentration gradient.

872
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,870
It's pumping CO2
into the deep ocean.

873
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,640
This is called the
biological pump.

874
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,180
So phytoplankton
serve this function

875
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,170
in the oceans of constantly
keeping the CO2 concentrated

876
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,290
in the deep ocean.

877
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,580
And just as a thought
experiment, if they didn't exist

878
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,740
and you mixed all
the ocean, so all

879
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,880
that CO2 equilibrated
with the atmosphere,

880
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,400
there would be 2 times as
much CO2 in the atmosphere.

881
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,550
We'd be really cooked.

882
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:13,750
OK, so when I came to MIT, I was
already studying phytoplankton.

883
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,120
And the most of the different
species, here are some pictures,

884
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:23,870
are roughly were between 10
and 100 microns in diameter.

885
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,090
In 1979, a colleague of
John Waterbury in Woods Hole

886
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,690
discovered these tiny little
1 micron phytoplankton

887
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,230
is called synechococcus.

888
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,130
They're shown here fluorescing
orange because of the pigments

889
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,600
they have, and they
were discovered

890
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,590
because a fluorescence
microscope was suddenly became

891
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,110
available and you could see
these tiny little things.

892
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,440
And I was lucky enough
to have a team of people.

893
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,830
To work with a team of people.

894
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,480
We took a flow cytometer, which
is a laser based instrument

895
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,770
on a ship, and Rob Olson,
brilliant young scientist,

896
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,410
was able to see even smaller--

897
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,290
whoops-- even smaller
than synechococcus.

898
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,303
You can't really see it.

899
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:04,720
There's two little
red dots there.

900
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,520
That's also chlorophyll
fluorescing.

901
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,490
That circle.

902
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,760
This little organism
called prochlorococcus.

903
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,500
It's the smallest and most
abundant, photosynthetic cell

904
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,120
on the planet, it turns out.

905
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,140
It's less than a
micron in diameter.

906
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,310
It's the size of the wavelengths
of light that it absorbs.

907
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,670
And I've been studying
it ever since.

908
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,200
It's been my muse.

909
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,780
And we now know that
there are three billion,

910
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,080
billion, billion prochlorococcus
in the global oceans.

911
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,450
They're everywhere in the
warm mid-latitude oceans.

912
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,810
Their annual photosynthesis
is equal to that

913
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,840
of all crops on land.

914
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,370

915
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,100
And over the years, we've
been able to isolate them

916
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,600
into culture.

917
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,180
And after the human genome
was finished being sequenced,

918
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,130
we were able to start.

919
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,280
They were one of the first
microbial genomes sequenced,

920
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,640
because they're so small, you
could do it in half a year.

921
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,440
Now, you can do
it in a half day.

922
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,610
It's very exciting.

923
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,040
So we're knee deep
in genomes now.

924
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,010
So genomes, transcriptomes.

925
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,020
We use all the
technologies that are

926
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,680
developed for
biomedical research,

927
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,850
we apply to prochlorococcus.

928
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:21,480
And now we have a
database, we can go.

929
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,810
These are transects in
the world oceans where

930
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,410
we have a database of
prochlorococcus genomes

931
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,990
from all over the global oceans.

932
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,470
And so over the
years, I just let

933
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,260
prochlorococcus point the way in
terms of what we should study.

934
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,400
And this is a beautiful
model organism

935
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,330
to use for what I call
cross-scale biology, which

936
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,390
is really ecology.

937
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,680
But that word is loaded.

938
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,630
So we call it cross-scale
system of biology.

939
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,650
And so my goal was just to
use this organism to study it,

940
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,020
not only at the molecular
level, but all the way

941
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,030
to the global biosphere
level, the oceans.

942
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,850
Which you can do with
this simple little cell.

943
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,810
And some of the things-- these
are just some of the stories

944
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:09,810
that we've learned
across, along the way.

945
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,410
The first thing we learned is
that although this cell has

946
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,410
about 2,000 genes, every
time he sequenced a new one,

947
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,370
you'd find 100 new genes
that you didn't see before.

948
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,250
And the projected pangenome
of the collective of all

949
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,770
prochlorococcus in the
oceans is about 80,000 genes.

950
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,440
That's four times the
size of the human genome.

951
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,560
So this tiny,
simple little cell,

952
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,680
it's really a superorganism.

953
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,060
And we can debate whether
it's a single species,

954
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,490
but by many measures
it's a single species.

955
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,930
So it's incredibly diverse.

956
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,950
And that's how it
maintains these populations

957
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,210
throughout the oceans.

958
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:52,040
Also one of my postdocs recently
discovered a novel gene transfer

959
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,460
agent, which he named
[INAUDIBLE] after a goddess

960
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,330
of good fortune or something.

961
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,820
Anyway, these serve
to move genes around

962
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:07,790
within the superorganism
to continuously create

963
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,790
the diversity in the system.

964
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,190
They also make these
novel metabolites,

965
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,540
secondary metabolites.

966
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,840
They make hundreds
of these molecules

967
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,140
that in most model microbes that
are studied make one or two,

968
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,740
and we don't know what
their function is at all.

969
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,173
That's-- somebody else has
got to figure that out.

970
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:29,090
But it's really exciting
because the cells are

971
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,010
trying to tell us something.

972
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,630
There are thousands of these
molecules in the ocean,

973
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,430
so we see them in the cultures.

974
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,060
You go in the ocean,
look at the sequences

975
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,950
and you can see that there
are thousands of variants.

976
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,020
Also we've studied vesicles.

977
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,310
They pop out little
lipid bound vesicles

978
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,060
that contain DNA and RNA.

979
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,120
So then you go to the
oceans and you say,

980
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,680
are there vesicles
in the oceans?

981
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,860
Yes, there are.

982
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,490
There are thousands
of different species

983
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,465
are making these
vesicles in the oceans

984
00:47:00,465 --> 00:47:01,590
and putting them out there.

985
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:07,180
It's like dissolved information
going around in the oceans.

986
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,280
And also studying interactions
between prochlorococcus

987
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,317
and other organisms, a
new evolutionary theory

988
00:47:14,317 --> 00:47:14,900
was developed.

989
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,940
Not in my lab, but
in a colleague's lab,

990
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,750
called the Black
Queen Hypothesis,

991
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,200
which is really interesting.

992
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,390
So some people say, well,
that's all very interesting.

993
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,850
It's basic research,
but how can we use them?

994
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,790
And I get this
question all the time.

995
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,880
And I say, well, they're
out there doing their job,

996
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,220
keeping the biological
pump and all of that.

997
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:42,780
But I look to the Sand County
Almanac for the answer from Aldo

998
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,570
Leopold and hopefully
not insulting anybody

999
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,820
in the audience who
wondered how to use them.

1000
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,110
But I'm sure that in
time, they will be used.

1001
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,230
They are the smallest
amount of information

1002
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,010
that can do this amazing
photosynthesis reaction.

1003
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,680

1004
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,140
OK, so what do we
need more of at MIT?

1005
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,650
I think we need more of
this curiosity driven

1006
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,780
research on life on our planet.

1007
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,000
And I'm all for human health.

1008
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,300
And that's what this
initiative is about.

1009
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,360
But also, I think
we need to broaden

1010
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,380
our scope of life sciences
to embrace, most importantly,

1011
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,420
plants.

1012
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,270
I think we need
more of that at MIT.

1013
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:31,670
So life is a complex
adaptive system.

1014
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,800
And this-- here's my laser--

1015
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,710
this is where we've
focused a lot of energy

1016
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,370
here in biology at
MIT, for good reason,

1017
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,720
and with amazing results.

1018
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,330
I think that focus is
incredibly important.

1019
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:52,930
But what I like to remind us is
that this is how things work.

1020
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,640
But this, at this level, the
ecosystem level, the population

1021
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,370
level, is why they work
that way, because that's

1022
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,750
where evolution is operating.

1023
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,140
And there's feedback
mechanisms from these.

1024
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,160
This level of
organization feeds back

1025
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,590
on this level of
organization and shapes it

1026
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,980
through natural selection.

1027
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,410
So we need to look at both
how and the why of the system.

1028
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,910
And this movement is underway,
I'm very excited to say.

1029
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,430
I say let's not miss out.

1030
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,520
Molecular biologists, let's--
these are papers that just came

1031
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,430
out recently.

1032
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,820
"Let's Reconnect With Nature,
Integration Across Scales."

1033
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,620
This one is actually
from a colleague at MIT.

1034
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,510
Mick Follows.

1035
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:36,680
"A Metabolism Shared
Across Scale."

1036
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,710
So there is a movement
to go in this direction.

1037
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,290
So with that, I
think prochlorococcus

1038
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,900
and all the people that
contributed to this,

1039
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,440
but most importantly
two foundations

1040
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,810
made all of this work
possible, the Moore Foundation

1041
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,290
and the Simons Foundation.

1042
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:58,850
I never would have been able to
do this without that support.

1043
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,660
It's extraordinarily important.

1044
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,730
And finally, you probably
can't read this, but this.

1045
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,880
I was playing around
with the ChatGTP

1046
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,890
and said, what would
MIT and Kendall Square

1047
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,400
look like in 25 years if
my fantasy world existed?

1048
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,890
And that's what we
hope will happen.

1049
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,150
And it came up with
plants all by itself.

1050
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,740
So it understands.

1051
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,920
I'm supposed to sit down.

1052
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,135
[APPLAUSE]

1053
00:50:28,135 --> 00:50:29,290

1054
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:29,790
OK.

1055
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:33,770

1056
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,620
Fantastic.

1057
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,200
Let's see.

1058
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,760
So I hope-- I really
enjoyed these talks.

1059
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,760
I hope you did too.

1060
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,630
I think it really captures how
life science, broadly defined,

1061
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,290
is going to play a huge role in
many aspects of human health.

1062
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,870
And these are leaders
in that space.

1063
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,200
So this is your chance
to ask them questions.

1064
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,010
And I heard there's a prize.

1065
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,570
First question gets a free book.

1066
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,070
But you do have to come up to
the mics to ask your question.

1067
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,340
So if you can come up to the
mics and ask your questions,

1068
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,720
that way the interpreter
can hear and interpret.

1069
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,830
Thank you.

1070
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,480
OK I have actually
three questions

1071
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,720
for three different people.

1072
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,680
And they're quick.

1073
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,380
One is, given that the
nitrogen fixation requires

1074
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,900
a combination of a
plant and a microbe,

1075
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,570
is anybody talking
about simultaneously

1076
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,430
engineering both of them--

1077
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,670
both kinds at the same
time to communicate?

1078
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,730
Second question.

1079
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,050
The density that you
cite in New York,

1080
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,140
do you consider per
area or per volume?

1081
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,330
I mean, New York
is really built up,

1082
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,910
so that might make a difference.

1083
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:47,140
And the final question
is, in deep sea vents,

1084
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,650
is it really
dependent on the sun?

1085
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,510

1086
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,220
I guess we can
take them in order.

1087
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,720
Yeah, sure.

1088
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,803
We can take them in order.

1089
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:55,810
Dave and then Janelle.

1090
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,840
Yes, so the way we're
envisioning this

1091
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,150
is sort of a
co-optimized system.

1092
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,115
We're not using any sort of
directed evolution process where

1093
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:03,615
we're--

1094
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:06,540

1095
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,390
the process is not
so much co-optimized

1096
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,550
as the goal to have a
co-optimized system where

1097
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,740
we understand what the plants
want, what the microbes want,

1098
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,323
and how they're
talking to each other.

1099
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:17,910
So yes, the idea is to
have them synergistic

1100
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:23,390
and sort of designed in
tandem to be together.

1101
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,290
Yeah, and on the
density question,

1102
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,630
it's a terrific density--

1103
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,440
or a terrific question.

1104
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,900
We were looking at density in
terms of the total population

1105
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,570
density.

1106
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,890
And then for mixed
density, it was including

1107
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,940
building type and building use.

1108
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,390
So mixed density included both
residential and commercial.

1109
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,940
And when you map out what
that variable where it is,

1110
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,260
again you see the
areas like Manhattan

1111
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,390
have a lot of mixed density.

1112
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,680
Rental overcrowding was also
taking total population density

1113
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,940
and combining it
with housing type.

1114
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,640
So type of family, is it a mixed
family, a multiple family unit

1115
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,970
complex, and then number of
residents in that in each unit.

1116
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,210
So, so rental
overcrowding showed

1117
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,990
areas where you have
rental use, but then high--

1118
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,580
more density in
each rental unit.

1119
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,210
So kind of I think
that is both combining

1120
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,480
the area and the volume
for that question.

1121
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,030
The deep sea vents,
the bacteria down there

1122
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,740
are oxidizing hydrogen
sulfide, and so they

1123
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,650
need oxygen to do that.

1124
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,270
To fix CO2.

1125
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,880
Right, Dave?

1126
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,380
Yeah.

1127
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,210
So it's coming
from the atmosphere

1128
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:39,960
up above, which is
coming from the plants,

1129
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,030
and finding its way down
to the deep ocean and that.

1130
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:47,825
So in effect, they need
oxygen from plants.

1131
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:52,450

1132
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:53,460
Thank you.

1133
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,290
Hi, my name is Amy Nurnberger.

1134
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,270
I'm from data and specialized
services and research data

1135
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,530
management.

1136
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,920
Thank you, each of you, for
such delightful presentations

1137
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,170
showcasing the
variety of work that

1138
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,660
is done around the
biosphere and plants.

1139
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,520
Given that necessary
interdisciplinarity,

1140
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,430
the focus on collaboration
in this initiative.

1141
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:19,900
Can you each speak
briefly about what

1142
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,460
you would like to
see from yourselves,

1143
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,820
from your colleagues,
from others on the stage

1144
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,680
to increase the effective
sharing, and reuse

1145
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,500
of the data and other
associated products

1146
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,730
that your research creates, so
that you can more fruitfully

1147
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,770
grow from each other?

1148
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,500
Thank you.

1149
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,180

1150
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,730
Well, I think one of the
themes of this session

1151
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,090
is across scales.

1152
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,170
So I think the key to
that understanding,

1153
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,420
and Penny did a great job
of wrapping it up with that,

1154
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,740
is understanding how to
get the output of one scale

1155
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,120
to merge the input of
the other and vice versa.

1156
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,320
And I think sometimes
fields are very

1157
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,960
specific in the type of
data that they produce,

1158
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,980
and how they look at it.

1159
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,960
But I think finding
metrics, like in some ways

1160
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,640
actually, I think
photosynthesis is

1161
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,470
a great example for this
because of fluorescence,

1162
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,350
like we both talked about.

1163
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,780
That actually allows
a kind of cross scale.

1164
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,580
Because you can
look at the process

1165
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,340
itself in a way that you
can't with other things.

1166
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,240
You need an exogenous reporter.

1167
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,910
And so I think while we have
that in what we measure,

1168
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,360
we maybe don't save it in
the same way or report it.

1169
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,330
And I think having
catalyst type funding that

1170
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:44,710
allows you to build across
fields allows that kind of thing

1171
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,480
to happen.

1172
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,310
Yes.

1173
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,100
I mean, your question kind
of keeps me up at night,

1174
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:49,642
to be honest.

1175
00:55:49,642 --> 00:55:53,107
So we've heard a lot
about omics this morning.

1176
00:55:53,107 --> 00:55:54,440
Penny mentioned different omics.

1177
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,650
I do a lot of
genomics and we've had

1178
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:59,547
20 some years now to think about
what to do with genomic data.

1179
00:55:59,547 --> 00:56:01,630
In a sense it's kind of
easy and that there's only

1180
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,310
four letters that
make up-- five if you

1181
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,770
want to count Uracil for RNA.

1182
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:09,490
But it's something that's pretty
easily stored and manipulated

1183
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,780
and we more or less
understand what it is.

1184
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,450
And we've now gotten
to the point where

1185
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,310
we can collect
all the other omic

1186
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:18,490
data much more easily than we
can analyze it or even handle

1187
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,020
it.

1188
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,250
So I am very interested
and very concerned

1189
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:25,960
with how we would standardize
metabolomic, proteomic

1190
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,460
phenotypic data,
that kind of stuff

1191
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,750
that Gabrielle's lab generates.

1192
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,780
These are optical things.

1193
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,490
Like how do you quantify and
store that and compare it?

1194
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:38,530
So thinking about ways
to integrate big data

1195
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,800
and be clever about how
we generate the big data,

1196
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,948
I'm very bullish on.

1197
00:56:42,948 --> 00:56:45,240
And think we need to spend
a lot more time on doing it.

1198
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,090
And I'm optimistic the
people at MIT can this out,

1199
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:50,770
but it's something that
we're very focused on.

1200
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,950
Yeah, so another area of my work
I wanted to talk about today

1201
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,310
but didn't really have time is
Indigenous community planning.

1202
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,913
And I've been building
a group in urban studies

1203
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:01,330
and planning that's
really focused

1204
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:04,330
on trying to weave traditional
ecological knowledge

1205
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,860
into conventional sciences.

1206
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,740
So for example,
the nitrogen cycle.

1207
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,080
That's well known in
Indigenous practice

1208
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,730
of growing three different
species together,

1209
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,420
the corn, beans, and rice,
to help fix the nitrogen.

1210
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,320
There's a lot of knowledge
about plant urban

1211
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,810
and natural systems that comes
from Indigenous communities.

1212
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,500
So the green space we
showed in the COVID study,

1213
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,860
how significant that is.

1214
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,550
It has a cooling factor,
but it isn't just

1215
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,180
the physical cooling factor.

1216
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,900
There's a lot of well
demonstrated health literature

1217
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:39,100
about how being around
high quality green space

1218
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,410
or high quality density of
trees helps human health.

1219
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,630
And one of the things--

1220
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,460
one of the students in my lab
has started studying is seeds.

1221
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,880
The way in which they have
actually acoustic resonance.

1222
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,550
So she played sounds
to seeds, and then has

1223
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,650
demonstrated that the
seeds actually respond.

1224
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,320
There is sound that comes back.

1225
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,840
And she's done some really
amazing architecture

1226
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,910
and art displays,
mapping and showing

1227
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,690
what that sound looks like.

1228
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,680
But we're partnering now with
Professor Nicholas Makris, who's

1229
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,330
in aeronautic and
acoustic engineering,

1230
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,860
to look at that sound
resonance across a broader

1231
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,950
spectrum of trees.

1232
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,190
And it could
revolutionize the way

1233
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:19,253
we think about urban planning
in relation to plants.

1234
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:21,170
So there's a whole, not
just within the seeds,

1235
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:26,310
but mature plants, a whole sound
biology that exists around them.

1236
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:29,130
And we're in planning, often
thinking just about sight.

1237
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,450
Visually, what are we seeing?

1238
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:34,050
Or even the light impact
is somehow a site impact.

1239
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,670
But acoustically what is
happening both in our natural

1240
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:40,620
and our urban environments
is critically important.

1241
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,325
And so this kind of combination
of Indigenous knowledge,

1242
00:58:43,325 --> 00:58:45,200
what is known about the
species, what they're

1243
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,030
speaking, what they're saying.

1244
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,480
The urban planning and
then the life sciences

1245
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,270
of understanding the physics
and the engineering of that

1246
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,030
could be really critical
in unpacking and creating

1247
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,240
new areas and ways in which
we think about planning

1248
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,600
and development and health.

1249
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,643
And so I think this initiative
really captures that spirit.

1250
00:59:03,643 --> 00:59:05,310
And that's critically
what we need more,

1251
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,000
is to put people from
different disciplines

1252
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,820
together, from different
ways of knowing together

1253
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,190
and combine that knowledge
to better effect.

1254
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,950
Be efficient.

1255
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,810
I'll just second what Dave said.

1256
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:20,770
Because we have just this
extraordinary database

1257
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:23,290
of prochlorococcus
sequences from all

1258
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:26,980
over the global oceans just
screaming with studies,

1259
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,150
with things to tell us.

1260
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:33,220
And it's just a huge challenge
getting it all organized

1261
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,900
so that others can use it.

1262
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,790
So we have time for one
more question today,

1263
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:38,660
which is fantastic.

1264
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,910
You guys didn't have to
listen to any of my questions.

1265
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,470
So well done as an audience.

1266
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,840
Go for it.

1267
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,360
So my question is about
the COVID-19 research.

1268
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,610
I'm curious.

1269
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,800
I think it's Lydia
Bourguiba's lab

1270
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,070
that showed a real
correspondences between humidity

1271
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,430
in the immediate environment
and COVID transmission

1272
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:00,550
and that in tropical
locations, it's

1273
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,710
when the humidity goes
above a certain point that

1274
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,340
COVID transmission increases.

1275
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,750
And in climates
like ours, it's when

1276
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,090
we start to spend a
lot of time in dry heat

1277
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,650
in the winter that COVID
transmission increases.

1278
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:18,380
I was really struck by your
mapping of flood zones and heat

1279
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,980
zones with COVID.

1280
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:21,860
And I'm curious if that is--

1281
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,670
if there's any
collaboration there?

1282
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:27,500
If that's another factor,
and if that sort of humidity

1283
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,790
might be another
interventional lever that we

1284
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,100
could use in public health?

1285
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,420
Absolutely that's
a terrific point.

1286
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,710
And thank you for highlighting
that research within MIT

1287
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,380
as well.

1288
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,310
It's something we haven't
published the flood risk

1289
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,590
paper yet, the flood
risk version of this,

1290
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,790
but something that was really
significant in type of building

1291
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:52,050
was basement use.

1292
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,660
Where are people
living in basements?

1293
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,860
It's a huge vulnerability.

1294
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,958
I mean, you can
understand for flood risk.

1295
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,750
Obviously, we've seen
that in New York City

1296
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,560
before with some of
the major storms.

1297
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,210
But then also with COVID risk.

1298
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,800
And so humidity might be one of
the factors where again, where

1299
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,000
are people living
in crowded spaces,

1300
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,530
rental spaces with
suboptimal urban conditions.

1301
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,460
And then how is that
increasing the compound risk

1302
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,500
or the compound vulnerability.

1303
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,190
A great point.

1304
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,940
Thank you.

1305
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,700
Thank you.

1306
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,380
Thank you guys very much.

1307
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,482
Thank you for being here.

1308
01:01:23,482 --> 01:01:25,440
You have 20 minutes to
make your way back over.

1309
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,880
So thank you, guys.

1310
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,330
[APPLAUSE]

1311
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:31,000
