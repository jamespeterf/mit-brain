1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
We have many uninsured individuals in

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,799
America, about 30 million uninsured

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,319
individuals. You might ask, well, is

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,680
that worth doing thing about? We

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,519
probably have more than 30 million

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,120
people who don't have beautiful flat

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,800
screen televisions. Are really going to

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
do something about that? You got supply,

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,240
demand, the market works. Healthcare,

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
there's a number of problems. For

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
example, if I don't get health insurance

12
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,600
and as a result I get sick and I come in

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
here today and I cough on you and you

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
get sick, then I've imposed a cost on

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
you that I'm not incurring. We call that

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,000
an externality.

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,000
>> That's a problem with the healthcare

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,679
market. Economic models work best when

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,040
markets are competitive. When there's

20
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,399
many competitors trying to compete for

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,160
your business, that's not true in

22
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,160
healthcare. If you're a hospital on

23
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
Nantucket, you got a monopoly. You're

24
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,520
the hospital. There's no competition.

25
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
People aren't going to take a ferry to

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
get their heart attack dealt with. For

27
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,960
all these reasons, we need to bring in

28
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
the tools, other tools to help think

29
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,760
about how we fix problems in the

30
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,760
healthcare markets.
