1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,120
how are you you still have a little bit

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,640
of energy for me okay good good good

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,040
good I was actually listening to the

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,320
last presentation it was super

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,440
interesting so culture obviously is a

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,160
key thing um underpinning the things

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
that I'm going to talk about but I'm not

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,439
going to talk about culture but culture

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,439
is actually the enabler for for these

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,720
methods and

11
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,800
um maybe we can use AI to to help with

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,360
that but what I'm going to talk about

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,559
are how do we design

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,480
Solutions in this fiercely competitive

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,480
environment we all live in uh how do we

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,559
design for the unknown and unexpected so

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,800
I come from a program where we are

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,079
looking

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,879
at how we

20
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,960
might literally change the world if you

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,359
will so we get to work with students

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
from across MIT from labs and Studios

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
across MIT

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
who are really trying to engage some of

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,400
the most super complex problems we as

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,759
humans we have created for ourselves and

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
how do you do that we need to push the

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,479
boundaries of science yes we need to

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,360
push the boundaries of Technology yes

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,759
but we also need the tools and methods

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,079
of design in the mix and I'm going to

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,520
try to talk you through why we think so

33
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,920
I'm of course completely brainwashed by

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,280
this we've been looking into this for

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,280
years and um I was lucky enough to to

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,920
help create two Global Life Science

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,399
companies where this way of working was

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,720
in instrumental in the way we could

39
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,079
scale as fast as we did so now I get to

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
work with students and they do all the

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,920
hard

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,040
work so but it feels like we are

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,520
innovating in the eye of the storm right

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,159
the everything is changing as a much

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,680
much much faster Spa Pace than we ever

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,759
seen before and to be able to keep up

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,520
with the rate of change I can just see

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,039
it with chap DBT in the classroom I can

49
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,280
only imagine what it feels like for you

50
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:14,120
so how might we even begin to keep up

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,480
with these changes and um the problem

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,560
with super complexity is that it's very

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,560
very difficult to Define it's very

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,480
difficult to really figure out how these

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,080
systems multiple systems moving at the

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,920
same time but the Innovation opportunity

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,599
often lies right there it lies in the

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,280
periphery between multiple systems that

59
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,319
are

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,319
moving but as we know there's no one

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,680
discipline there is no one way of

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,319
solving these

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,640
problems and uh there's no single

64
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:54,239
solution to them but in we can though

65
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,879
begin to chop away at them chip away at

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,840
them and figure out a way in numbers how

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,640
we can actually do that so uh Accord

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,680
according to

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,440
McKenzie 75% of companies are really not

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,560
ready to to do that

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,319
75% and there are surveys coming out now

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,319
showing that um if if you talk to CEOs

73
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,040
they say 80% of them feel that they are

74
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,360
not ready to to engage with the world

75
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,239
the way it's moving so it's really a

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,760
high number and we also see it's not

77
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,760
going so well I don't know if youve seen

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,239
these types of numbers and Harvard for

79
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,640
instance there's a study a few years ago

80
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,840
done by Harvard showing that up to

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,280
95% of new Solutions fail to meet

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,280
customer expectations

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,680
95% of new

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Solutions failing to meet users

85
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,000
expectations nine out of 10 startups

86
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,680
fail and out of those who survive only

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,720
one in 200 actually manages to grow at

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
scale think about this think about the

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,280
waste think about the waste in time

90
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,120
waste in money waste in resources and

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,120
the question is does it have to be this

92
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,959
way and here in the US they do surveys

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,639
of this all the time annually they they

94
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,440
look into why for instance startups Die

95
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,040
Why do nine out of 10 startups die and

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,360
the shocking thing is it's that almost

97
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,160
half of cases the founders say that they

98
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,440
had to close their doors because they

99
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,720
launched

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
something there was absolutely no need

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,759
for

102
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,600
it can you imagine you go through all

103
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,720
the Hocus Pocus and then on the other

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
end there was no need for it and you

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,240
begin to think about why is

106
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,840
that why is that what is driving the

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,400
innovator's mind to drive something all

108
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,880
the way to Market only to find out oops

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,720
when you're there also you can see on

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,120
the slide there are other data points

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,520
there about knowingly launching an

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,039
userfriendly

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,160
products um knowingly not including the

114
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,280
user in the process so when the The

115
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Innovation hits the market there's no

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,280
way for the users to actually engage

117
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,240
with it but my favorite obviously is the

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,120
the one on the right there uh that

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,199
almost 25% of them dis blame their

120
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,800
team it's just my team's fault so uh of

121
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,600
course team is very important so I

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,240
shouldn't be joking about it but the the

123
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,479
ugly truth is that a lot of these

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,120
mistakes actually can be avoided so I

125
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,319
brought you a little

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,120
picture so this would be the typical

127
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,800
Innovation process as you can see we go

128
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,680
we get an idea we're so excited about it

129
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,680
you and your grandmother absolutely love

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
it and you stay in the basement and

131
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,840
you're working on it working on it

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,280
working on it either in the lab or the

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,440
studio or the basement and then only to

134
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,120
find out when you are in the

135
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,120
marketplace that there is no traction

136
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,120
there's nothing happening there's no one

137
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,080
that actually needs

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,560
this and as you know when you're out

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,120
there it's very very very difficult to

140
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,400
go back and we call it a very scientific

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,120
term for this called the

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,680
squiggly so this is the squiggly you

143
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,919
don't want want to do this quickly at

144
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,759
the end of the process you want to do

145
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,039
this thing early on you want to do this

146
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,440
in the safety of your lab or safety of

147
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:46,080
your office or safety of your studio

148
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,080
where you can do all these

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
experimentations

150
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,080
iterations in the safety of pen and

151
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,720
paper if you will so this is where

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,639
design comes in because design gives us

153
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,440
the freedom to test and retest to design

154
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,759
itself I'm not talking about the design

155
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,039
of an object you know I'm talking about

156
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:11,479
the act of Designing the ability to make

157
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,319
decisions through continuous iteration

158
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,680
and problem

159
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,919
solving and uh by doing that up front

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,000
what we see here is that eight out of 10

161
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,960
actually manage to to grow and scale and

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,280
launch so there's something that happens

163
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,120
here that can

164
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,319
so we can avoid a lot of the the palls

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,199
that we have

166
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,240
so the way we look at it and why we

167
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,000
think design needs to be right there

168
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,280
next to technology and science is that

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
there's no mathematical formula alone

170
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,319
that can capture all the complexity of

171
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,319
the human mind and all our emotions our

172
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,000
cultural viability and all these things

173
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,440
that's why we need a task of design in

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,440
the mix

175
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,720
[Music]

176
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,360
and one way of doing it is to try to

177
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,639
Envision the

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,319
future and then work backwards from

179
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,400
there but it's not that easy because as

180
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,960
we know the rate of change is not linear

181
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:24,720
it's very very chaotic it comes in spur

182
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,120
but then it also goes back and forth

183
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,639
back and forth back and forth back and

184
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,560
forth so it's very very difficult to

185
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,080
understand and know where to play but if

186
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,000
we can do that if we can flow with

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
complexity rather than fighting it then

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,760
that creates certain type of resilience

189
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,600
in your organizational culture but also

190
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,920
in your company as a whole so the way we

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,760
do it if you think about it how do you

192
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,800
deal with complexity today how are we

193
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,920
trained since we were in elementary

194
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,480
school to G engage

195
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,440
complexity you think about it just a

196
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,839
sack how did did you do that and how do

197
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,839
you do it

198
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,519
today most of the

199
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,360
time we break it down into manageable

200
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,839
chunks right and we try to solve one by

201
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,760
one by one by one by one and we hope

202
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,320
that the future is still there when we

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,519
finally get

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,360
there so but in fact this is actually

205
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,079
limiting our Innovation opportunities

206
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,920
greatly because we are making the

207
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,120
choices fewer and fewer and fewer and

208
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,399
fewer from the

209
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,560
beginning so we might be missing the

210
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,160
most critical pieces which is actually

211
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,720
contradictory to Innovation and this is

212
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,920
kind of what it looks like

213
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,560
so we believe that we can do ab C D or

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,800
PPA or whatever this is we can break it

215
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,160
down and we can go one by one one by one

216
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,800
one by one and eventually we got this

217
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,560
but in reality what happens is that this

218
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,839
is what it's going to look like when we

219
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,959
finally get there even by engaging

220
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,560
complex systems everything else

221
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:21,040
changes so even just touching the field

222
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,200
will create a chain reaction so how

223
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,560
might we survive in this Pond how can we

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,040
flow at the same rate if this is not the

225
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,800
right way going

226
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,600
forward and

227
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,800
um that's why we believe we can we can

228
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,800
design for this we can create a process

229
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,519
for this so when we talk about design

230
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,200
think process think problem solving

231
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,519
think process of

232
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,360
discovery and there are multiple

233
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:55,480
multiple ways tools and methods that

234
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,720
design has that allows you to do this

235
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,760
and if you think about design it's very

236
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,720
very different from an analytic

237
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,279
process it allows you to kind of bounce

238
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,519
between fantasy and data fantasy and

239
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,240
data what was the last time you can

240
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,440
actually think fantasy in your workplace

241
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,639
it's like when could you be in la la

242
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:22,200
land a little bit uh but as we have way

243
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,639
too much data or in many cases no data

244
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,320
we have to be able to create we have to

245
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:32,560
be able to imagine what this could be so

246
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,000
bouncing between fantasy and data allows

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,519
us to be more daring it allows us to be

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,079
more elastic in the way we innovate so

249
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,000
it actually helps us get to where we

250
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,959
need to go faster so we do all this

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,639
quickly first and then we can actually

252
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,079
go faster so in way applying design as

253
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,399
you solve super complex

254
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:02,279
problems is a very practical approach

255
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,839
but is also very creative so it's not a

256
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:08,600
number crunching mechanism you also need

257
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,680
a dash of creativity in there if we are

258
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,120
going to solve any of the complex

259
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,360
problems we've faced such as climate

260
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,120
change Injustice urbanization all these

261
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,160
big problems there's no one

262
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,320
solution The Innovation like I was

263
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,000
saying lies usually somewhere in between

264
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,160
and how are you going to get there if

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,639
you eliminate all your options in the

266
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:38,560
beginning so how can design

267
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
help we can design

268
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,480
help we have been doing research on this

269
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,839
for the last few years and

270
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,839
um we've talked to people who walk the

271
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
North Pole we talked to people who run

272
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,519
nuclear power plants we've talked to

273
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,040
designers of every corner of the globe

274
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,720
and we kind of ask them how do you do

275
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,440
this how does this work and out of that

276
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,680
work with good help of AI I mind you uh

277
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,320
there are three kind of main principles

278
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,839
that mer merge and um the first one is

279
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,160
when you're facing a super complex

280
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,639
situation maybe inside your own company

281
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,279
or maybe in the world the first

282
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,760
principle is we kind of have to

283
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,519
surrender to

284
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:30,240
it we have to surrender to the fact that

285
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:33,199
um every single problem is cont textual

286
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,760
meaning it is different in any given

287
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:38,240
context and this is where design comes

288
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,639
very strongly in because any designer is

289
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,760
trained to be very comfortable with

290
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:47,480
ambiguity very comfortable with going in

291
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,720
circles but more importantly being very

292
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,000
comfortable with direct user engagement

293
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,000
we can use a lot of data but there is

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,959
something in this human interaction

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,160
there's something when actually being

296
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,959
there observing what's happening on the

297
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,279
ground so the first principle is this

298
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,720
every every time we engage super complex

299
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,880
problems it has to be contextual we have

300
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,680
to have the humility to say I don't know

301
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,639
anything I'm going to discover

302
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,120
everything and that is tough especially

303
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:27,040
in a space that we think we know super

304
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:31,560
well so contextual is is number one

305
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,160
number two only at Mi T you would call

306
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,720
interdisciplinary

307
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:40,000
polyic so so to you have to be a

308
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,639
polymath meaning every single engagement

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,720
process has to be

310
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
interdisciplinary or

311
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,680
multidisciplinary or

312
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:54,480
polyic meaning that we cannot solve it

313
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,279
alone so the context is very very very

314
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,160
different it's very very fluent so it

315
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,680
means that the people on the team

316
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,600
working on your solution have to be

317
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,560
polyic they have to be able to come from

318
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,360
different uh Industries different parts

319
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,720
of of your organization or different

320
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,480
parts of life even having your customers

321
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
inside the

322
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,440
process and I'm lucky enough to serve on

323
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,560
on Boards of companies that are doing

324
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,000
amazing Innovation work and they bring

325
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,480
in their customers they are actually a

326
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
part of the process and it's called

327
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,120
designing with people instead of saying

328
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,639
designing for

329
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,720
people

330
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,759
so make sure you're prospecting for

331
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,319
knowledge wherever you can find it so

332
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,519
that's number two and number three is

333
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:51,759
the one that absolutely the enemy of

334
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,319
anybody who who really likes methodical

335
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,519
processes and that is emergence meaning

336
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:00,040
we have to have the patience to wait for

337
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,000
the solution to actually emerge through

338
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,800
the

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,680
process and for me it was really really

340
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,360
really difficult to learn how to do that

341
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,880
because you are trained and I come from

342
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
business school initially so my PhD is

343
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,399
from the London School of Economics so I

344
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,880
was trained to go from a to be as fast

345
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,480
as I possibly

346
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:26,360
could but in reality when has your first

347
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,920
idea ever been your best idea think

348
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,759
about that has your first idea idea ever

349
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,880
been the best idea I dare to say no it's

350
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,399
through the iteration and continuous

351
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,000
testing against the vision that you have

352
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,600
for this and your understanding of the

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,279
context that actually

354
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,319
yields the right solution so it

355
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,519
literally emerges through the process

356
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:55,160
and it's a combination of multiple

357
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,240
different data points multiple different

358
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,560
ideas that eventually after testing and

359
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,560
testing and testing

360
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,120
merge into something that you would call

361
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,319
a preferred

362
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,319
solution so design gives us this Freedom

363
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,120
it gives us this freedom to experiment a

364
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,919
little

365
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,559
bit to make sure that we can throw

366
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,280
spaghetti at the wall a little bit to

367
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,240
make sure that when we're engaged in

368
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,919
super complexity that even if we are

369
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,480
very reliant on data we are not reliant

370
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,520
on data

371
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,720
alone but we know what to do with the

372
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:35,080
data and then how we can bounce between

373
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,440
the fantasy and the data as we need to

374
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,240
and the way to do that is to apply these

375
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,880
principles of design so this is kind of

376
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,640
your job if you are in Innovation this

377
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,280
is kind of your job and this is why they

378
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,880
pay you so much

379
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,720
so so if you take a look at this

380
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,640
so any Innovation idea that involves

381
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,000
technology for

382
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,360
instance we cannot only think think

383
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,880
about the technology we have seen how

384
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,679
that ends so we really need to think

385
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,400
about the human in the equation can this

386
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,960
technology of course like I said before

387
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,840
we are pushing the boundaries of of uh

388
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,640
technology we're pushing the boundaries

389
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,320
of Science and a lot of things coming

390
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,679
out of MIT they do not have practical

391
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,400
application until 20 30 40 years from

392
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,240
now even but for those of us who are

393
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,039
kind of

394
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,000
applying in the near future future if

395
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,679
you will we really have to do this we

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,840
have to understand the human need what

397
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,520
is called the functional needs and the

398
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,640
emotional needs of people to understand

399
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,720
how might the technology actually help

400
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,720
meet those needs so we have what is

401
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,480
called problem solution fit but just to

402
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,320
make it a little bit more

403
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,640
difficult we also have to have nature in

404
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,039
mind because we also see in how that

405
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,679
goes when we just think about human

406
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:05,080
needs we have completely destroyed this

407
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,880
planet because we have been obsessed

408
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,400
with fulfilling human needs so we have

409
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:16,039
to think about nature so as we weave

410
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,520
this web of Technology human needs and

411
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:22,760
nature you also have to make it work

412
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,480
financially so how can that be done and

413
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,240
this is a process of iteration as you

414
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,600
can see you cannot just come out with

415
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,679
this idea and say I got it this is a

416
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,720
very methodical process but it's also

417
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,760
very different from the stage Gates

418
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,480
processes the menu of you know in

419
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,480
Industry where you kind of pass through

420
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,360
certain stage gauges as you innovate

421
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,159
this is very much a live

422
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,840
process and on top of it what you do

423
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,200
today is very very different from what

424
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,039
you could do a few decades ago so what

425
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,000
we did in the 70s or the 80s we cannot

426
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,120
do

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,080
today so all of this is very sensitive

428
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:11,080
to time place context time place context

429
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,159
because we really need to become an

430
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,880
expert in the context in which we

431
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:20,039
innovate and if we can do that this

432
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,799
becomes much much much more easy and it

433
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,799
looks like this if we had to

434
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,840
crosssection of our regular Tuesday this

435
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,559
is what it would look like because we

436
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,799
are trying trying to bring together all

437
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,799
these different data points all we're

438
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,919
prospecting from knowledge all over the

439
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:40,679
place to really try to figure out and

440
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,440
test test test test test test through

441
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,320
prototyping through quick even pen and

442
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,880
paper exercises or quick modeling to see

443
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:54,200
which of these combinations

444
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,480
actually best meet the future that you

445
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,880
envision when that problem is either no

446
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,799
longer there or if that problem problem

447
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,760
can be

448
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,480
mitigated and

449
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,640
eventually we come to a point where

450
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,080
there might be a solution or there might

451
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,600
be a few

452
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,159
Solutions and that's one thing was very

453
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,120
hard for me also to learn is that every

454
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,559
time you do this there's no one solution

455
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,960
there might be multiple Solutions we

456
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,679
just have to be flexible enough to try

457
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,080
and go and find

458
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:30,240
them and

459
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,520
um this is what we call choreography

460
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,360
it's literally choreographing a path

461
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,919
forward the least path the path of least

462
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,320
resistance if you will so you try to

463
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,120
figure out a way where is the path where

464
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,960
we have the harmony of Technology human

465
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,279
nature and you can make some money doing

466
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,320
it at the same time

467
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:57,840
so just thinking about it in those terms

468
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,360
makes it easier to do just see it

469
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,360
visually

470
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,679
makes it easier to

471
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,840
do but it requires a lot of patience but

472
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,600
this can happen very fast this can

473
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,720
happen in a matter of minutes this can

474
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,240
happen in matter of hours this can

475
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,720
happen in matter matter of months just

476
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,159
depending on your the scale and scope of

477
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,360
what you're trying to

478
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,679
do so the sign gives you this freedom to

479
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,360
explore that's kind of what we the way

480
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,320
we talk about it because it really is a

481
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,440
process of discovery

482
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,039
and we are all designers you're all

483
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,000
designers after years of schooling it

484
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,559
has kind of been beaten out of us in a

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,200
way because we have become more rational

486
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,480
more rational more rational more

487
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,960
rational as we go but now when the world

488
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,559
is no longer rational we need to go back

489
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,279
find some of that creativity find some

490
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,960
of that ability to

491
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,960
experiment in a more free context if you

492
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,840
will but the first step is really trying

493
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,760
to understand the context and becoming

494
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:08,400
the expert in your context but it is an

495
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,799
iterative process and it enables you to

496
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,760
really create this problem solution fit

497
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,000
if you understand what are the needs you

498
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,400
need to

499
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,039
fulfill the functional needs and the

500
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,120
emotional needs then whatever solution

501
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,640
you're creating you can create a

502
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,960
solution that is not over engineered we

503
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,679
don't have too many belts and missles or

504
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,200
under engineered meaning there a gap

505
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,240
between so by being able to understand

506
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,600
and create with people you actually have

507
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,480
a much much much better chance finding

508
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,279
that

509
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,520
lock where you might have one two or

510
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,840
even three potential solutions to

511
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,039
whatever problem you are

512
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,520
investigating then you just have to pick

513
00:23:51,039 --> 00:24:00,880
one we're all so just kind of close it

514
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,559
off I think at the end of the day it's

515
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,799
about understanding the context it's

516
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,480
about having the humility to really work

517
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,400
with the people we aim to

518
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,600
serve so we achieve that

519
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,000
luck and all of this will help

520
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,039
organizations going forward and we do a

521
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,320
lot of work both with big corporations

522
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,080
and

523
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,960
startups and interestingly enough it's

524
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,600
some some of them really gravitate

525
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,880
towards this naturally others have to be

526
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,320
trained and they train themselves to

527
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,279
think in this way but at the end of the

528
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,440
day if you have this

529
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:45,279
combination you're more likely to

530
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,360
squiggle at the right time so you don't

531
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,159
actually have that problem where 50% of

532
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,520
new innovation actually

533
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:56,320
ends and

534
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,600
uh that is the secret actually is in

535
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,039
that process and in that mind

536
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,559
mindset so having said all of that I

537
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,399
think I'm ready for your questions

538
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,240
anything you have for me happy to happy

539
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:14,279
to answer any of your

540
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,559
questions on this Spa thank

541
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,520
you thank you so much for a great

542
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,399
presentation there are a couple of

543
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,279
questions okay start at the top could

544
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:26,039
you please give us a real example of a

545
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,919
previous project where you applied your

546
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:32,080
fluid context and super complexity

547
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,000
processes and what were the outcomes yes

548
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,200
okay great question so if I just take

549
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,440
maybe example of of teams that we work

550
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,159
with here the startup teams so there was

551
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:47,960
this one startup team that was looking

552
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,240
to solve a huge issue in urban settings

553
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,640
in Latin

554
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,360
America brilliant team and we're all so

555
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,399
excited about their solution we had gone

556
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,559
through everything and we had what were

557
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,120
the human outcomes where the societ

558
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,679
outcomes and what were the financial

559
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,799
outcomes and we're like this is it we

560
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:09,200
got it you know but then they go to that

561
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,720
place where they did their pilots

562
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,960
nothing is happening like nothing is

563
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,279
happening nothing is working and they

564
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,200
had initially identified like three

565
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:23,640
things that they believed was important

566
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,520
they had done interviews they had done

567
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,360
all kinds of observations they had done

568
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,440
a ton of research and they w Really

569
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,880
becoming an expert in this particular

570
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:39,279
context but they missed one major major

571
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,760
thing it has to do with human behaviors

572
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,720
so they went there to a particular place

573
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,840
and they lived there for a

574
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,679
year and they stayed with the people

575
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
they aim to serve and I'm not saying you

576
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,080
all have to do that but that's a very

577
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,960
good example of something that they

578
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,320
thought was number one on the priority

579
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,440
list apparently was at the bottom of the

580
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,480
priority list and what they thought was

581
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,200
at the bottom of the priority list but

582
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,159
at the top of the priority list so

583
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,960
simply going through it with the people

584
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,559
who actually um use and need the

585
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,559
solution and Al actually have them

586
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,559
design it with them completely change

587
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,880
the Chang the outcome and they're

588
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,880
now and they were voted one of the most

589
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,279
Innovative companies in Latin America

590
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,880
but took a while to get there but they

591
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:35,159
got there so the Squigly took a little

592
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,760
bit longer time than we anticipated but

593
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,559
they got there

594
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,760
eventually

595
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,519
nice okay let's move on to the next

596
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,000
question leaders who grew up through the

597
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,679
era of industrialization tend to find it

598
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,720
difficult to adopt design thinking

599
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,039
largely only in brainstorming but hardly

600
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,279
in envisioning and Innovation do you

601
00:27:54,039 --> 00:28:01,640
have any advice yes great question so

602
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:03,919
for 30 years I've kind of been guilty of

603
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,559
using the traditional strategic planning

604
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,320
tools you know the SWOT and the planning

605
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,559
and the the the annual budgeting and all

606
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,480
that kind of good stuff and still we

607
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,279
need that don't get me wrong we need all

608
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:21,679
of that but can you think of a

609
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:25,760
company that was going like very

610
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,399
strong but suddenly completely collapsed

611
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,640
because they missed

612
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,840
a new wave of Technology coming their

613
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,360
way give me a

614
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,799
name Kodak what

615
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,000
else huh Blockbuster blueberry blue

616
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:46,880
Blackberry oh I still miss my

617
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,720
Blackberry what happened you know

618
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,760
someone said Google was now experiencing

619
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,200
the same thing with the latest Swift AI

620
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,960
I don't know about that but if you think

621
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,799
about what happens what happens when

622
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:05,080
this it's because when we do regular

623
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,360
budgeting when we do regular strategic

624
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,399
planning we are always looking at the

625
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,679
future by looking at the

626
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:15,080
past correct we're doing the like

627
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,320
three% incremental change or we're

628
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,320
adjusting for inflation and we're kind

629
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,880
of drisking ourselves to

630
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,720
death this is drisking we think we're

631
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,919
the risky because we are moving

632
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,679
incrementally you know

633
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,480
but in fact we can be caught with our

634
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,360
pants down

635
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,880
literally uh because we didn't see the

636
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,200
future coming so what we usually do when

637
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,600
we work with companies is that we

638
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,080
combine both tools of design not

639
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,880
necessarily design thinking design

640
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,279
thinking is a fantastic tool that came

641
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,720
literally brought design to the

642
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:55,240
Forefront of corporate decision- making

643
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
but this is the process of design the

644
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,559
tools of design whatever you want to

645
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,519
call it but but you have ways something

646
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,960
like what is called design futures for

647
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,320
instance it's a way for you to stand in

648
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,440
the

649
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,360
future and then plan your way back so a

650
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,159
combination of a

651
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,960
datadriven

652
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:21,320
drisking but then also having the

653
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,840
boldness to also dare to come at it from

654
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,399
the other

655
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,360
end that usually yields you know more

656
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,480
instead of these incremental

657
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Innovations we get these radical

658
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,760
Innovations so we need both it's like

659
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,480
with so many things in life we need both

660
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,679
there not one or the other but both and

661
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,679
a healthy combination of both is

662
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,440
good okay let's take another question or

663
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,399
two on that note how can you

664
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,760
differentiate between a lack of Market

665
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,200
need and a solution that is simply ahead

666
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,480
of its time

667
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,279
this is about creating the creating the

668
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,720
market so I think it was Steve Jobs that

669
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,559
said that you have to get so close to

670
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,440
your customer that we know long before

671
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,240
they know what they

672
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,480
need

673
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,039
right

674
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,039
so there is a truth in this for sure

675
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,919
so the whole idea of becoming an expert

676
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,600
in the

677
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:31,399
context is not the ability for the

678
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,559
customers to tell us at least not the

679
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,919
way we see it that the customer tell us

680
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,679
what the solution should be the

681
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:41,720
customers or the users they are their

682
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,639
experts in their own

683
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,120
lives we are just observing that so when

684
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,720
we talk about being an expert in the

685
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,720
context you are lit literally observing

686
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,000
what's going on where are the needs and

687
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,120
where is that urgency because most

688
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,200
startup for instance they recognize a

689
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,240
need most corporate Innovation

690
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,480
recognizes there is a

691
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,720
need but what we fail is to find that

692
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,919
urgent pain point if you

693
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,960
will that people cannot live without a

694
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:17,200
solution to to go beyond the most

695
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,519
obvious needs down to these needs that

696
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,039
are unmet and people cannot articulate

697
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,960
that's where your expertise comes it you

698
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,600
map all of this stuff out but then Here

699
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,799
Comes Science and Technology and really

700
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,480
are responsible of creating the

701
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,600
solution so Henry Ford I don't know if

702
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,519
it's true or not but he's quoted to have

703
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,120
said if I had asked people what they

704
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,480
wanted they would have said Faster

705
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,960
Horses right what did they need to do

706
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,240
they need to go faster from A to B

707
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,919
correct or less smelly horse or I don't

708
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,200
know what they would have said but they

709
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,679
needed to go from A to B maybe they need

710
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,080
a little more Comfort or or whatever it

711
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,519
may be but at the time people did not

712
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,440
have any concept of a car the word

713
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,120
probably didn't even exist so how can

714
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,919
you see that so by studying people's

715
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,159
life understanding how people live their

716
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,679
life and figuring out where are these

717
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,279
urgent pain

718
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,720
points we can bring in science and

719
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,960
technology to really create the

720
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,360
solutions so that's kind of how we look

721
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,480
at this and by doing so you might be

722
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,080
creating

723
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,639
a whole new

724
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,080
market in the process of

725
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:41,440
it thank you Safa okay let's take one

726
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,399
one more question I have it up

727
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,880
here this is from

728
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:49,080
Enrique your view what is the

729
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,919
relationship between design and time how

730
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,639
free can you be when you are subjected

731
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,639
to Real World Financial operational and

732
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:57,840
strategic demands

733
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:59,960
yeah this is a million dollar question

734
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,200
question so whoever asked it maybe you

735
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,559
can help me answer

736
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:09,639
it so this is I think the most common

737
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,679
question especially in startups have

738
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,159
less worries around this because

739
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,280
startups are naturally iterative they

740
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,040
can they can pivot too fast or they can

741
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,919
pivot too slow uh but most of the time

742
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,639
they're just occupied with trying to

743
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:24,720
survive and trying to figure out the

744
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,520
solution but for those of us who also

745
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,760
live in the corporate

746
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,200
world this this is the most frequently

747
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,119
Asked question we

748
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,280
get because you guys have time

749
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,040
constraints you have budget constraints

750
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,560
and there is this notion that if we

751
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,639
innovate or we spend like

752
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,079
3% on Innovation 6% of innovation

753
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,800
automatically the compan is going to see

754
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,839
Revenue growth down the road this is

755
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,480
this kind of incremental investment in

756
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:00,920
Innovation um which def L works for a

757
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,320
lot of companies but then you have these

758
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,640
fluke incidences where there is

759
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,880
something that happens and you're

760
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,480
completely caught um so you have to be

761
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,640
able to do both but what I was saying

762
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,240
this

763
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,119
squiggly it looks like it takes a lot of

764
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,280
time but I can promise you it takes it

765
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,680
can take a very short period of time and

766
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,359
it certainly takes less time and it's

767
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,960
less expensive than discovering that we

768
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,079
launched the wrong thing

769
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,119
I come from the life science Industry

770
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:38,800
launching the wrong thing is dangerous

771
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:41,560
you know so taking the time before it

772
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,240
goes into the corporate Innovation

773
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:48,160
protocol or the gug stage systems that

774
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,440
we have taking the time to really ideate

775
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,119
quickly but then at the same time test

776
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:57,000
test test test test test test before it

777
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,359
goes into this long extensive uh

778
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,319
expensive

779
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:04,760
process uh is is the key here so it

780
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:07,280
takes more time it's more expensive not

781
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,200
to do it I would

782
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,200
say bafa thank you so much I think we're

783
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,960
going to thank you wrap there thanks for

784
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,960
a wonderful talk
