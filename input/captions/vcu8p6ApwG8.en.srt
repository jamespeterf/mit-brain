00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,719
Hi everyone, I'm Shingi. I'm a graduate

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,280
student working with Carolina and Shiva.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,120
I'd like to pres present our multimodel

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,480
framework for understanding a holistic

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
representation of cell states and tissue

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,359
organization. So we've heard from

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
previous talks that there are many ways

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
of understanding cell states. Not only

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
can we look at the gene expression to

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,960
understand transcriptional cell state,

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,720
we can also look at chromodine images

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
which is which contains very rich

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
information of the mechanical state of

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
cells and we can look at additional

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
modalities such as protein stains or how

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
cells organized in tissue by looking at

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,280
spatial transcripttoics or looking at

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,520
tissues um tissue imaging. But the

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
challenge coming with all of these data

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
is that it's very hard to compare cross

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
modalities because we cannot easily just

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
look at compare image pixel intensities

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
to the value of gene expression. So in

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,920
order to fully under fully utilize all

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
of the available data modalities, we

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,440
need to develop a method that can take

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,320
into account the very different

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
measurements and we propose a framework

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,119
for doing that. So we have one

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,000
autoenccoder for each data modality and

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,799
then we can uh have the autoenccoders to

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
jointly encode into the shared

33
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,960
representation that now have a union of

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,720
information from all the input data

35
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,600
modalities. With this shared

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,119
representation, we can then perform

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,360
downstream analysis such as

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,439
visualization and clustering. Not only

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,759
comparing the similarity of cells based

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,320
on gene expression, but also comparing

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,960
the cells based on if their chromatin

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
image is pathologically similar.

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,960
So now if we for example if we cluster

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
the cells based on the sharp

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
presentation then the cells would be

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,759
grouped together based on their

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,399
similarity in all of the input

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,360
modalities. So we then uh apply this

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,079
model to for to to look at the special

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
transcrytoic data set uh of Alzheimer's

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
disease MOS model and now we're

52
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,799
integrating the into the shared

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,719
representation this the gene expression

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,119
the uh cell chromatin images and

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,119
location of cells in tissue and we can

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,879
then look at what the clusters tells us

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,039
and how does it differ from the

58
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,280
clustering of a single modality alone.

59
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
So if we apply the clusters back into

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
where they're located in the mouse

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,800
brain, you can see that it's nicely

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
outlines where the cortex region is and

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
where the hypoc campus region is and

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
it's very consistent across the

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
different mice mouse brains. And if we

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,040
look closely into this cortex region of

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,200
mouse, our clustering is saying that uh

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,760
there's this novel separation in the

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,440
mouse mouse brain cortex as this differs

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,760
from the horizontal layers in a

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,319
reference atlas. So we wondered what's

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
separating this mouse cortex brains. And

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,519
if we look at an orthogonal stain that

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
we did not actually use to train our

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
model, which is the MOI beta plaque, a

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
pathological protein associated with

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
Alzheimer's disease, we can see that

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,840
this novel separation in the cortex

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,599
region actually correspond to how likely

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
the plaque is going to accumulate in

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,200
that particular region. And in

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
particular, a cluster three region is

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,879
more likely to accumulate more plaques

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,599
and larger plaques. So this tells us

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,319
that um the integration of multiple data

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,319
modalities is able to identify this

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
spatial progression of Alzheimer's

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,680
disease and the likelihood of the

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,879
special regions in accumulating um the

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,920
the pathological

91
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,879
proteins. And since we have the power of

92
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,200
multimodality, we can then look at

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,800
tissue mark look at disease markers not

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,879
only in terms of the gene expression

95
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,959
differences, but we can also look at the

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,799
uh the biomarkers in terms of the

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
difference in cell chromatin. So for

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,040
example, we can look at where in this

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,920
chromatin image is more predictive of

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,920
that there's a ml beta plaque nearby. So

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,159
we al so we indicated this

102
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
predictiveness of chromatin image of an

103
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,640
M beta plaque in the image by the

104
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
intensity of blue pixels. And it turns

105
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,879
out that the predictiveness is not only

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
highlighting particular cell types, but

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
it's picking out very specific single

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
cells within one cell type. For example,

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
this microglea, but not the microglea

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,680
next to it. It's not only just picking

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,599
out entire cell nucleus, but it's also

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
picking out denser regions in a cell

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
nucleus such as this region in the

114
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
inhibitory neuron, but not the entire

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,000
nucleus. So this leads us to the

116
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,759
hypothesis that perhaps um our model is

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,359
really looking at the denser regions of

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,400
the chromatin or the hetrochromatin

119
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,199
region as a pred as a for the prediction

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,199
of amaloid beta plex. So if we quantify

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
the hetrochromatin across different cell

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
types we can see that there's a very

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
consistent increase of hetrochromatin

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,320
whether it's in neuronal cells or glyo

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,520
cells when we compare the ad mice to the

126
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,759
control mice. So this tells us where

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,919
chromatin is a very simple and cost

128
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,919
effective biioarker. It contains a lot

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
of information about cell states and can

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
be directly used as a disease biomarker.

131
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,880
And because it's so informative, we then

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,120
wondered can we use chromatin as a way

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,080
to predict missing modalities. So as

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,160
we've heard before that um in the same

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
experiment we cannot simultaneously

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,400
measure all the possible modalities and

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,479
that's especially the case when we are

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,240
going into the measurement of proteins.

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,479
So if you want to understand protein

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
localization, we can take protein

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,120
stings. However, we have 20,000

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
different proteins in a human that can

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
be possibly expressed in a human cell.

144
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,039
And then if to study this protein

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
localization across all the possible

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,759
cell lines and then this will be

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
experimentally

148
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,520
invisible. And because to fill up this

149
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360
matrix of protein localization in the

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
different cell lines, we need to perform

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,360
one experiment for each pair of protein

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,919
and cell line. Um so people have

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
actually done that uh to and to create

154
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,080
one of the largest existing database uh

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
for protein localization namely the

156
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,199
human protein atlas and even after many

157
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,120
years of efforts and resources our

158
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,520
understanding of protein localization is

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,600
still incomplete that we only have 41

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,520
different cell lines measured in HPA and

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,320
we only have 17,000 proteins measured in

162
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,240
HPA and and more importantly not all

163
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,280
pairs of these um proteins and cell

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,600
lines are measured that only 0.25% of

165
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
all the possible pairings were measured

166
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
and this is because the number of

167
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,720
proteins that can be measured in the

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
same experiment is limited. So it's

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,360
perhaps not possible to experimentally

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520
profile all the possible pairings. So we

171
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,520
need a computational tool that can allow

172
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,680
us uh to predict the protein

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,960
localization from measurements that we

174
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
have that we have and uh with all that

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
if we combine the protein sequences

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
together with cellular stains that tells

177
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
us the cell state the cell states and

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,000
cell types we can then make predictions

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,039
of the protein localization with a

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,039
single cell and cell type specificity.

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,120
So to do that we first uh look at the

182
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,520
sequence representation of proteins by

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
using a language model and this is and

184
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,759
the ESM2 is a structural prediction

185
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,680
model that takes protein sequence to pro

186
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,360
predict protein structures. We tailor

187
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
the sequence representation learned from

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
ESM2 to the particular task of a

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,680
localization prediction by training this

190
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,080
classifier that takes the sequence

191
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,319
representation to predict the local the

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,919
localization labels.

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,759
We can then learn cell states from

194
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,759
cellular stains and we are not only

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,680
using the chromatin stain but we also

196
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
have stains for microtubial and er in

197
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
the human protein atlas. So with this uh

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
image representation that tells us the

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
state of single cells uh we can then

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
combine the sequence representation with

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,599
image representation to make a

202
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,919
prediction

203
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,560
uh of that particular protein in a

204
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,639
single cell.

205
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
So we tested this model across many

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,319
unseen proteins and unseen cell lines

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,319
that we not that we did not use in the

208
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
training uh in the training of our model

209
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
and we can quantify the prediction

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
errors across different proteins. If we

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,280
categorize this prediction errors across

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
proteins in different cellular

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,919
compartments, we can see that our

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,199
prediction uh is quite accurate and

215
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,639
performs equally well across different

216
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,360
compartments. And we collaborated with F

217
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,639
chro institute to perform experimental

218
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,879
validations to see in addition to um

219
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
predict localization in unseen proteins

220
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
and unseen cell lines, can we also

221
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
predict localizations in new

222
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639
experimental context. So we looked at

223
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,639
two cell lines that the model has seen

224
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,360
in training. And we can see that our

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,599
model prediction is aligned quite well

226
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,800
with the experimental validation even

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,319
for proteins that were not used in

228
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,160
training. And we can then look at cell

229
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,160
lines that the model has never seen

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
before. And again, our model performs

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640
quite well and aligns well with the

232
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,159
experimental validation and even for a

233
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,080
cell line that's not included in

234
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,320
HPA. And now now since we have the

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,760
ability to mix predictions of proteins

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,000
and cell lines that a model has never

237
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,760
seen before and fill up this matrix of

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
proteins by cell lines to understand

239
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
protein localization, we can then be

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
able to perform tasks and understand

241
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,760
protein properties that were not that

242
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,080
were not accessible before because of

243
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,240
the missing data. And one such protein

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
property is how protein varies how

245
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
protein localization varies across

246
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,200
different cell lines in the human

247
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,120
protein atlas. One protein is only

248
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,120
measuring up to three cell lines. So

249
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,800
it's hard to understand the variability

250
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
of proteins across different many

251
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,640
different cell lines. And since we

252
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,640
filled up this matrix of um proteins by

253
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
cell lines, we can now compute the

254
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,399
variability of proteins across many

255
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
different cell lines. And if we then

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,760
rank the proteins based on their

257
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
variability, we can see that the most

258
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,160
variable proteins are associated with

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
processes that are known to be dynamic

260
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,080
such as regulation of transcription,

261
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,560
cell differentiation, and chromatin

262
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,240
regulation. And here's one example of a

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,640
protein that our model predicted to be

264
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,720
highly variable. So for example, in this

265
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,440
MCF MCF MCF7 cell line, the protein is

266
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,959
more in the in uh in inside the nucleus.

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
Whereas in a different cell line like

268
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,920
this MB4 cell line, the protein is more

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,120
outside of the

270
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,800
nucleus. And we can also do the same

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
analysis not only on a cell length

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,320
level, but to also understand the

273
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,959
variability of protein localization on a

274
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,000
single cell level. And since we're using

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,240
a multimodel um input to make a

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
prediction of protein localization, we

277
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
started to wonder that which cellular

278
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,000
compartment that we used as an input is

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
contributing to this variability of

280
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,640
localization. Additionally, we showed

281
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,640
that our model can predict quite

282
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,320
accurately for many different proteins.

283
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,920
But where's the limitation of such a

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,760
prediction? Are there features in

285
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,839
protein localization that cannot be

286
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,680
derived from cell states learned from

287
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,519
cellular stings?

288
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
So to answer these two questions, we

289
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,480
developed a model that not only

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,560
integrates different modalities but also

291
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
explicitly disentangles what's the

292
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,440
shared information between the different

293
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,600
modalities and what's the modality

294
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,279
specific information because in this

295
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
case if we want to know where's the

296
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
limitation of a cross modality

297
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
prediction, we can then look at the

298
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,640
shared information versus the modality

299
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
specific information and only the shared

300
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,160
information capture captured by the

301
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,079
shared latent space would be something

302
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,480
that's that's predictable in a cross

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,880
modality prediction.

304
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,399
uh and and then we can also try to

305
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
interpret what's in the share space and

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,040
modality specific space uh in order to

307
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,959
understand which which component in the

308
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,160
input modalities is contributing to the

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,360
variability of protein

310
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,040
localization and because we have a very

311
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,800
segmented latent space that we have a

312
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,880
shared latent space versus two modality

313
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,240
specific latent space in order to make

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,000
such training possible uh we're having a

315
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
novel training scheme that instead of

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,560
training the encoders and decoders

317
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,480
together as a standard autoenccoder. Uh

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,640
we have a two-step training process that

319
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,880
we train a randomly initialized latent

320
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,279
space together with a decoder and then

321
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,519
to generalize two cells that were not in

322
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,680
involved in the u train in the first

323
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,680
step training we have a second step

324
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,079
training process that maps that trains

325
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,440
encoder to map the input modalities to

326
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,079
the shared

327
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,120
spaces. So with this model we can then

328
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,880
disentangle the share space and the

329
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,720
modality specific space and compare the

330
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,800
chromatin stains versus the different

331
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
protein stains. So for example if we

332
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,120
want to know if we actually need to

333
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,399
experimentally measure the protein stain

334
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,279
for gamma H2AX versus predicting gamma

335
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,040
H2AX from protein from chromatin ST and

336
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,360
protein sequence. we can look at the

337
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,639
share space and modality specific space

338
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,279
and then we found that for the for some

339
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,360
general characteristics of gam 2a x uh

340
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
intensity that's something that's in a

341
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
shared written space and that can be

342
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
predicted from chromine things whereas

343
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,399
if we want to understand what's the

344
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,760
number of DNA double stranded breaks

345
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,519
marked by this counts of gamma h2ax

346
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
that's something captured in a protein

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,040
specific space and that has to be

348
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
experimentally measured and cannot be

349
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,760
relied and cannot rely on cross modality

350
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,279
prediction from chromatin to predict the

351
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,839
gamx fosi

352
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,600
counts. Um, additionally we've seen that

353
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,200
the protein localization are quite

354
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,040
variable across cell lines and also

355
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,480
across single cells. We want to

356
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
understand what's the source of this

357
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,440
variability. Is it the nucleus stain

358
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,360
that's different or is it the

359
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
microtubial stain that's different and

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,440
which one is causing the differences in

361
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,240
the localization difference across

362
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
different single cells. So to do that we

363
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
can probe the shared or modality

364
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
specific latent space by clustering the

365
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,720
cells in each latent spaces and look at

366
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,160
the properties within each cluster. For

367
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
example we can look at what's the

368
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
intrauclear proportion of proteins in

369
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
cluster 2 versus cluster one. And uh if

370
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
there's a significant difference in

371
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,279
intrauclear proportion in a shared space

372
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,880
then this means that the variability in

373
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,880
the protein localization within the

374
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,279
nucleus is something that's captured by

375
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,440
the share space.

376
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,040
So for example if we do this for the CL

377
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,720
and S1 1A protein then we can see that u

378
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,880
the clust the two clusters in the

379
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,440
nuclear specific space show significant

380
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,800
difference in in the intrauclear

381
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,639
proportion and specifically if we look

382
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,320
at the high intrauclear proportion cells

383
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,320
versus a low intrauclear proportion

384
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
cells that there's a significant

385
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,000
difference in their nucleus morphology

386
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,440
and more specifically that the high in

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
the cells with high intrauclear

388
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,839
proportion of this protein has a higher

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,279
content of it

390
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,760
chromatin and We can similarly do this

391
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,760
for other proteins such as DDB1 and we

392
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,279
found that the variability of DDB1

393
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,519
localization is something that's not

394
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,240
related to nucleus but is instead

395
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
captured by both the microtubial and ER

396
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,360
and the variability is associated with

397
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,440
the intensity of microtubial and ER

398
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,399
channel as well as the volume of

399
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,680
cytoplasm to uh the ratio of the volume

400
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,839
of cytoplasm to the nucleus.

401
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
So, so to summarize, we've I've shown

402
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,000
that our framework not only learns a dry

403
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,680
representation uh that takes into

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,480
account all different modalities and

405
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,760
allows us insights uh into the cell

406
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
state and tissue organization

407
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,440
differences beyond what we can learn

408
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
from a single modality. We can further

409
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
disentangle the contribution from

410
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,720
different modalities and learn the

411
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
shared and modality lat modality

412
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,000
specific latent spaces. And this not

413
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,000
only allows us to uh have a better

414
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,720
experimental design in terms of in terms

415
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,800
of understanding the limits of um cross

416
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
modality prediction but also allows us

417
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,959
to understand the contribution of

418
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,800
different cellula compartments to uh an

419
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,639
observed phenotype. And with that I'd

420
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,120
like to thank my mentors and

421
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,060
collaborators Caroline Shiva and um

422
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:18,200
other group members. Thanks.

423
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,200
[Applause]

424
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,639
And I think we have time for one

425
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,760
question. Any questions? All right.

426
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,199
A very nice presentation. Um just one

427
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,480
quick questions. uh I wonder whether the

428
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,440
the chicken and egg you know uh paradox

429
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,440
is that when you try to measure the

430
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,680
croentine structure to predict you know

431
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,759
um the Alzheimer disease state and I

432
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,480
wonder whether you know the chromatin

433
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,839
was changed as a visa or the disease

434
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,199
state or you use the you know chromatin

435
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,639
as a predictor for the disease state.

436
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,240
Yeah, that's a question we've been

437
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
thinking a lot and that's a question we

438
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
don't have answers for and we need

439
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,000
additional either time course data or

440
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,320
perturbation data to understand if the

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,800
chromatin stays the chromatin change

442
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,240
happens before the disease change or if

443
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
there's something that's upstream of

444
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,000
both like cell state change and

445
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,000
chromatin change.

446
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,160
Thank you.
