9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
>> Uh, okay. So, I'm actually going to keep

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,080
discussion today pretty short because

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,800
the games that we've got lined up are

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,480
pretty long. Uh and uh there are

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
>> two of them I know are really good. One

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,079
of them was good last year. So we'll see

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,399
again this year.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,840
So So we'll see. Um are they all for

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,440
playing games at least?

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,399
>> I'm blessed. I we're going to have

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,760
Puerto Rico which I told

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,680
>> I call thieves.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,399
>> Cool. Uh for people have you played

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,039
thieves before?

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
>> No. Good.

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,680
>> Okay. So, uh, for people

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
>> who played San Juan last time, I think,

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
uh, Puerto Rico is an interesting

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
comparison. Uh, because San's actually a

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
sequel to Puerto Rico. Uh, so you're

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,439
kind of playing in reverse order.

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,119
>> Uh, that was the one where, uh, sort of

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,560
like, how would you describe it?

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,680
>> Is it related to Race the Galaxy as

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
well?

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
>> You choose the action.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,720
>> Ah, Race. Okay. So that that takes us

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:28,119
right into today's uh

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,119
>> so Puerto Rico is kind what was

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,159
>> Puerto Rico is the um I'm going to I'm

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,680
going to guess it was actually the first

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,360
in the series. I certainly do not know

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
of any immediate predecessors or

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,119
inspirations and uh San's kind of the

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,399
carc version of this. um which is why we

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,960
introduced it earlier because you guys

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:58,000
were working on on card games. Race to

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,640
the Galaxy is more of a um

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,520
spiritual successor uh as as described

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
in in in reading or uh but you could

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,640
also think of it as a clone with few

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
upgrades because it wasn't the same

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,720
people. It wasn't the same people who

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,640
made uh

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
>> to clarify the guy who did San Juan and

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,959
the guy who did Race for the Galaxy were

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
kind of collaborating

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
So the games are really similar. They

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
influenced each other, but they were not

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,879
strictly the same project. So you can

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,879
think of it as multiple people from the

60
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,400
same artist community turning out

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,800
similar games at the same time.

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
>> Nice.

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,239
>> You know, uh but yeah, informed by each

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,680
other. And um and when Race came out, it

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,040
was very much seen as this is this is uh

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
Puerto Rico with problems fixed or uh or

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,519
gameplay expanded uh

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,760
>> problems added to

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
>> and problems added to and you know and

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
of course a completely different scene

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,760
but you can s but at least in terms of

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,440
game mechanics that's a nice a nice

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
connection that you can actually see

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
among the games that you played before

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,840
and you're going to be playing today.

76
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,280
Um, not every single game that we've got

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
here is got that kind of u that kind of

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
heritage. In fact, today's games aren't

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
specifically picked to meet to meet to

80
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,800
match up with today's team uh of our of

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,159
sequels. The only reason why I talk

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
about sequels cuz we have to talk about

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,319
it sooner or later.

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,879
>> Um, of course, Battle Star is, you know,

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,920
straight up adaptation of of of the TV

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,319
series. And uh and you know I wouldn't

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,319
quite call this a sequel in a sense

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,239
because simply this is not based on a

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,000
previous Battlestar Galactica game. I'm

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,280
sure there were previous Battle Star

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,920
games that you know were based on the

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,920
old 70s TV series that have nothing to

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,400
do with this one. This is more of a

94
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
adaptation. Um and I and the reason why

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm using that that phrase is so that we

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,159
can be fairly clear in our in our

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,599
vocabulary. This is taking elements of a

98
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,959
something that's in a different medium

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,159
like a film or a TV series uh and trying

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,840
to figure out what in that TV series in

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,040
that world that has been created that

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,040
fictional world um might be might yield

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
interesting gameplay and this game is

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,959
pretty much about figuring out who is

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
Sylon among all the players

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,840
>> uh you know among all the players

107
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,799
there's going to be traders and you try

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,840
to hide your activities and you try to

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,919
help people uh help human race survive.

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
Uh if you happen not to be a traitor,

111
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,799
but some of the things that you end up

112
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,079
doing in order to help the human race

113
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,800
not to survive, they end up looking

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,800
suspicious. And if you play Mafia, it

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
kind of has a little bit of that feel.

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
This is way more heavyweight in terms of

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,479
game mechanics because they really

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
really wanted to make you think like the

119
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,800
charact like you have the same dilemas

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,800
that the characters in in the TV show

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
have.

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,120
>> Does the Sylon know that he or she is a

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,479
Sylon? I believe that I believe you can

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
find out halfway.

125
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,520
>> Okay.

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,639
>> Yeah. Uh if I recall the rules

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,479
correctly. Um and then there are people

128
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
and then there are uh players who will

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,639
know right from the beginning. So there

130
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
may be more than one

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,360
>> generally is more than one.

132
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
>> Um

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
>> I'm psyched.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,080
>> Okay. So um to um there were a bunch of

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,720
different things that were that were

136
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
listed in previous reason as reasons why

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,680
people want to do SQL but for for the

138
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,199
most part the big one is just you're

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,639
building off an established base. You're

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
not having to build everything from

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,280
scratch. Um in many cases a sequel

142
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,759
doesn't actually cost less or take less

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,240
time than making the original game. you

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
just end up spending hopefully spending

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,320
the development time a little bit more

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
wisely, right? You start you you you you

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,840
avoid a lot of pitfalls because they're

148
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,440
pretty much making a very similar game.

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,759
And game industry has been one of those

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,160
fields where uh um oddly enough, part

151
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
two, you know, the the followup tends to

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,720
be better than the original as opposed

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,400
to um you know, how many movie sequels

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
are generally better than the original.

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,600
Godfather, that's

156
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,759
>> back. Uh, it's rare.

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,160
>> It's really rare. Um, I'm thinking

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,000
>> the Kendy's word man of No Name series,

159
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
Godfather. Any other

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
>> Back to the Future?

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
>> Back to the Future.

162
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
>> I don't know. It could go either way.

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,000
>> I don't agree.

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
>> It could It's arguable.

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,759
>> It's arguable.

166
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,720
>> You mean like Empire Strikes Back?

167
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,360
>> Spider-Man.

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,600
>> Spider-Man, too.

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,319
>> I don't know. I felt like they were all

170
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
>> true.

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
>> It was better.

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
But yeah, you know, it's really

173
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,440
difficult because

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,240
>> Dark Knight. Uh yeah, I will yeah, I

175
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,080
will give you that. Um but you know,

176
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,960
it's it's still kind of tough. Uh

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,039
whereas how many good game sequels, how

178
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,479
how many games can can can you think of

179
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,840
where you play both the first the

180
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,759
original and then the sequel to it?

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,960
>> Also,

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,520
just the sequel.

183
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
>> Oh. Oh, okay. Because Okay. for some of

184
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,479
them the space apart so far that you

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
actually only ended up playing

186
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,759
>> I mean like Halfife

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
>> Halfife Halfife 2 for instance you know

188
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,319
Starcraft

189
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,440
>> Starcraft 2

190
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
>> Age of Empires

191
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
>> Age of Empires one two and then three

192
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,319
>> Shogun Total War

193
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,319
>> well the Total War series

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,720
>> yeah Total War is kind of an interesting

195
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,880
thing because they don't pitch them as

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,960
sequels but they but they very much

197
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
pitch them as a series and they and the

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
whole idea is that if you liked one game

199
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,400
you actually know a lot about what any

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
of the other games in that series do.

201
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,319
Sure. Graphically they're upgrading game

202
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
game mechanics wise. They're trying to

203
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
port over a lot of things. They just

204
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
some of them are medieval, some of them

205
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
are Japanese.

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
>> Yeah.

207
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,880
>> In reading they mentioned that Final

208
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,240
Fantasy 7 was a sequel to six. Is that

209
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,280
corre? I don't think is that like

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,599
correct nomenclature.

211
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,840
>> Uh you see and I and I will disagree

212
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,080
with that actually. It's like I don't I

213
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,319
mean Final Fantasy 7 actually has a

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,560
sequel for instance. Uh was it crisis

215
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
score

216
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
actually? There's more than one and it's

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
okay. Sure. Well, I mean, first it was

218
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
the movie, right? Their sequel was the

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
movie and then they they did a bunch of

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,160
things.

221
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
>> Oh god.

222
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,360
>> Final Fantasy 7 is Final Fantasy

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,400
>> an entry in a series, but

224
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
um

225
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
>> but I think when it comes to this is

226
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,479
what we're going to be pitching to a

227
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,479
publisher. I I'm not sure if Square Enix

228
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,919
needs to pitch Final Fantasy.

229
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,080
>> I I think of another game that has a

230
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,000
long series, you know, um if anyone can

231
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
come up with one.

232
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
Bersgate might be actually a good one

233
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,919
because different different companies

234
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
end up working

235
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,800
>> working on different types of revisions.

236
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,639
Uh actually most of the sort of yeah

237
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,000
that well actually Fallout and Balders's

238
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,159
Gate both come from inner play I believe

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,440
originally. So like

240
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,120
>> they went out of business after

241
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,680
Bloodlines. We were talking about this

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
yesterday.

243
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,959
>> I suspect that that was vampire

244
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
yesterday.

245
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,919
>> Yeah. But uh but basically it know

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,120
leaving aside what makes a company go

247
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,720
out of business. Um yeah the the the

248
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,240
issue of when you have a series and then

249
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,920
you have different companies making

250
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,320
different brands. Guitar Hero 3

251
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,800
nice old re

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,760
so boware was did the first one and

253
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Obsidian did the second one. Um Fallout

254
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,080
was Bethesda. Obsidian, I believe. OB

255
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,920
Obsidian's really built a whole business

256
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,120
model around making part two or

257
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,480
something. Um,

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
>> or expansion packs and stuff.

259
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
>> Oh, expansion packs. Yeah. Closely

260
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,040
closely

261
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,320
re related to that. And in those cases,

262
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,640
sometimes like in the case of um boware

263
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
obsidian connections, they they have a

264
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
good relationship. They're borrowing a

265
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
lot of technology and they are getting

266
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,279
that advantage of. We kind of we we

267
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,800
we've kind of ironed out the kinks.

268
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,080
we're just sort of continuing the story,

269
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,839
especially if it's a story based game

270
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,440
like Knights of the Old Republic.

271
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,640
Clearly, you've got to fit it within the

272
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
whole Star Wars story. Um, and they had

273
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,880
the interest to basically keep the tale

274
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,760
of these characters going. Uh, even more

275
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,240
so for well for Mass Effect it was by

276
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,200
the way by you know that sort of thing.

277
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,880
Um but then you have the other you have

278
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,320
the other angle where uh you just want

279
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,320
to sort of get the same success but you

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
want to tell a different story or in the

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,320
case of Guitar Hero 3 have a completely

282
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,399
different set of set of music. Um, and

283
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,839
uh, you know, Final Fantasy 7, you have

284
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,839
the certain game mechanics and certain

285
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,360
things that carry on from game to game.

286
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
And definitely you want to carry the

287
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
fans from game to game, but part of the

288
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,200
appeal of the Final Fantasy series is

289
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,720
that every single one is going to be a

290
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
different story. Not dramatically

291
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,600
different, but it's going to be a

292
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,839
different story um, with different

293
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,880
characters and different world.

294
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,640
So um but it's pitched very similarly

295
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,399
when you go to a game company and the

296
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
whole idea is how do we get the fans to

297
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,120
buy even more or even more fans to buy

298
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,480
version uh two.

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
There is a there are kind of two ages to

300
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
that sword though because what typically

301
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
happens in a lot of sequel development

302
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
is that you're trying so hard to please

303
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,160
your original fans and often by adding

304
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
complexity by adding things that build

305
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,000
on things that you that players of the

306
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,320
first game already know that you

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,480
actually start alienating new players uh

308
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,079
the game becomes just so complex or you

309
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,120
know just complex enough that people

310
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,360
start getting turned off. Um

311
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,079
uh couple of weeks ago over here we

312
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,560
played Guitar Freaks um on Friday on

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,839
Friday games for Gambit and the first

314
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,680
version is actually extremely

315
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,959
accessible. Once you get from the second

316
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
version all the way up to I think the

317
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,440
version four that we were playing uh it

318
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,519
is almost impossible for a new player to

319
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,959
jump in because they've got like one

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
beginner friendly song and everything

321
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,680
else is based for fans of the game. So

322
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,320
you imagine a Guitar Hero game that's

323
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,480
built entirely for people who've already

324
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
mastered expert on the previous game.

325
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,040
That's kind of what happened with Guitar

326
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,959
Freaks. And in many cases that might be

327
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
enough to, you know, if if game was

328
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,160
particularly successful the first time

329
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
around and you only get 80% of the fan

330
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,440
base to buy the second version, that's

331
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,680
still a lot of money and it's a way

332
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,680
lower risk compared to, you know, coming

333
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,399
up with new IP from scratch. Um but um

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
and and a lot of companies when they're

335
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,920
creating IP they're very much

336
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,079
specifically thinking right off the bat

337
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,920
what are the SQL opportunities even now

338
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,079
of course you got downloadable content

339
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,000
so it's even narrower than that is what

340
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
are downloadable content uh uh

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
opportunities how do we release

342
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
expansion packs you know really really

343
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
quickly and uh how do we create stories

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,320
worlds technology that just going to be

345
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,320
able to anticipate all that um there's a

346
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,320
game up there now on Xbox Live Arcade

347
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,040
called Monday night combat um and uh and

348
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,440
they they did some little clever hacks

349
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,560
to basically allow them to update the

350
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,639
game on a week- toeek basis. Whereas

351
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
typically that that kind of

352
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,000
certification that's required from

353
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,480
Microsoft is really expensive. Every

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,760
time you want to release a new version,

355
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
you have to put it through an entire

356
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,440
rigorous QA testing schedule again. But

357
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
they came up with some technology that

358
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,279
lets let them make at least game tuning

359
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,720
changes on the fly uh without having to

360
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,279
go through the Microsoft tuning uh uh

361
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,120
testing uh so it's not technically

362
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,639
releasing a sequel. Uh but they were

363
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,320
very much thinking about how do we keep

364
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,760
updating this game. Um I wouldn't be

365
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,079
surprised if Steam started off as that

366
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,160
Blizzard uh battle net kind of started

367
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,920
off as just an easy way for them to get

368
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,079
up patches and to keep tuning this game.

369
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
Eventually someone involved decided hey

370
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,959
we could sell games this way and you

371
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,360
know launch was kind of bumpy but you

372
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,680
know it's fine now

373
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,560
um

374
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,720
there is one thing which the which the

375
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,600
book didn't mention which is the reboot

376
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,880
the sort of franchise reboot um this can

377
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,760
sometimes happen when you have a uh

378
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,399
publisher who's got control of an IP

379
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,560
that kind of floundered halfway you know

380
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,880
maybe there was a bad bad execution on

381
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,959
the on on narration and lost most of the

382
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,120
fans or they just played out the formula

383
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,959
to death. Uh and then they want to try

384
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,040
to get a new batch of fans. You know,

385
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,880
few people who like the original one.

386
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,480
Um, and I was talking about the Tomb

387
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,480
Raider game uh uh you know that that um

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,160
where they're just trying to they've

389
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
rebooted the Tomb Raider several uh Tomb

390
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,040
Raider franchise several times at this

391
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,320
point each time trying to say okay

392
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
you've probably heard from Tomb Raider

393
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,199
from the huge amount of advertising that

394
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,800
we've done but you may not actually have

395
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,079
liked the previous versions of the games

396
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,560
and we're going to reboot this franchise

397
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,240
by making a different game in that same

398
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
world where maybe we'll make and Tomb

399
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,560
Raider will use the characters and we'll

400
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,040
use the fiction but we'll change the

401
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,480
game play significantly. Um because

402
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,120
we're not going after the old fans

403
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,680
anymore. We're going after a new batch.

404
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,959
Um it's uh probably about the same

405
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,480
technical challenge as uh updating as

406
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,360
trying to make a SQL for a completely

407
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
new platform. So uh uh because you're

408
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
basically having to write everything

409
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,399
from from from scratch. But the good

410
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,839
news of course is that all that previous

411
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,560
advertising that you did, you know, a

412
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,560
decade ago still still still works. Um,

413
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,959
let me think of uh Can anyone think of a

414
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,839
good example of a good reboot?

415
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,760
>> Is Mario 64 a reboot?

416
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,600
>> Uh, I think it was seen to a lot of pe a

417
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,600
lot of people that it was cuz it wasn't

418
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,000
clearly a uh a sequel to any of the

419
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,440
previous Mario games. And it was kind of

420
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Nintendo kind of saying, "Hey,

421
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
>> it's not really a clone of anything.

422
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,240
>> It's not really a invented a lot of

423
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,639
invented a lot of things for the first

424
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,680
time." In fact, I would say that Mario

425
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,279
64 and and and and of course the way how

426
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,480
they branded it, they didn't brand it

427
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,839
Super Mario World what, five or Super

428
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
Mario World 4 or something. They called

429
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,199
it Mario 64 to sort of distinguish it

430
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,800
from

431
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,720
>> I would almost call it an upgrade more

432
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,120
than a reboot though because it was

433
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,880
mostly just the move from two uh 2D to

434
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,880
3D. Um,

435
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
>> it was more it's a good challenge

436
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,519
because to the player it may seem like

437
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,600
it's not that, but for a technical point

438
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,680
of view, they had to completely reinvent

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,959
the way how Mario moves, the way how

440
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,880
Mario jumps, frankly. Uh, uh, the way

441
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,639
how the camera moves never used to be a

442
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,880
huge problem in the 2D games. Uh, but

443
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
was the primary thing that they managed

444
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,959
to figure out how to get working in in

445
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,720
in 3D was was the camera. Um, I think I

446
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,199
mean I wouldn't be surprised if their

447
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,800
marketing pitched it a little bit like a

448
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,079
sequel, but it was also very very clear

449
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,519
of like this is going to be a whole new

450
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,920
generation. You've never played a Mario

451
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,920
anything like this. So don't expect your

452
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,560
previous Mario experience to cover to

453
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,320
carry over necessarily.

454
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,279
>> I was going to say Metroid as well.

455
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
>> Metroid Prime.

456
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,199
>> Yeah.

457
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,000
>> Yeah. That's that's a really good

458
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,519
example of um in fact Metroid Prime was

459
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,880
an instance where they gave the

460
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,320
franchise to a completely different

461
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
developer. You know, previously it was

462
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,160
all old internal Nintendo and then

463
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,199
Nintendo went to Western Developer um

464
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,600
Retro Studios over in Texas and

465
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,759
basically had them make the first person

466
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,160
uh version of of Metroid, but they had a

467
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,560
very heavy hand in controlling that.

468
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,480
Whereas um I'm not sure we're going to

469
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,800
be playing this later, Castlevania Laws

470
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,600
of Laws of Shadow, which just came out

471
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,279
was a kind of windy other way around. a

472
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,360
western developer, a spe a Spanish

473
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
developer decided to make a Castlevania

474
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,799
clone. Um, you know, they love

475
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,160
Castlevania and they were going to make

476
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,919
a game that was just like Castlevania,

477
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,959
but they wouldn't call it Castlevania

478
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
because they didn't have the rights for

479
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,199
it. And then they showed it off at like

480
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,799
a E3 or something. And Konami basically

481
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,600
said, why don't just turn it into a

482
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,079
Castlevania game and they put Kojima on

483
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,199
it to to to make it work.

484
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
>> That must have been their dream come

485
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
true.

486
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,039
>> That was probably their dream come true.

487
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,240
That's probably what they wanted. And

488
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,480
you have the advantage of all the

489
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,480
Castlevania fans now now now saying,

490
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,919
"Okay, this is this is going to be in

491
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
Canada. If we like Castlevania, we

492
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
probably like this one." Which is

493
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,880
exactly what they were trying to get

494
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,559
across. It's like imagine the people who

495
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
made Torch Light being approached from

496
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
Blizzard say, "Why don't we just turn

497
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,720
this into Diablo 3?"

498
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,240
>> A bunch of people who made First Light

499
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,240
were from Blizzard, right?

500
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
>> Uh I wouldn't be surprised Diablo team.

501
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,640
>> I wouldn't be surprised in the same

502
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,840
sense that a lot of people who made

503
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,919
Guild Wars were from the World of

504
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:03,520
Warcraft team. Uh so that's that is less

505
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,799
issue of sequels and more an issue of

506
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,000
just that's just how the game industry

507
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,679
works. People move from project to

508
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,600
project and carry knowledge with them

509
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
>> like Call of Duty was elemental modern

510
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,240
people, right?

511
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,440
>> Yes. Call of Duty. Yes.

512
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
>> Got tired of it. We're like we can do

513
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
better.

514
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,640
>> That that that's an interesting

515
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,480
discussion of the instead of sequels uh

516
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,880
you have companies making effectively

517
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,640
clones uh competing against the original

518
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
franchise. And this particular case that

519
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,880
you're drawing yet there's people who

520
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,960
left EA uh of 2015 I believe and then

521
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
they started Infinity War and they made

522
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
a game that basically competed with the

523
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
original.

524
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,799
>> The first Call of Duty was so

525
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,080
ridiculously good. At least it marked me

526
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,400
when I played it the first time.

527
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,320
>> But it but it's very clearly trying to

528
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
be Medal of Honor the next version.

529
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
>> Yeah, clearly. Yeah. No, of course. Of

530
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,520
course.

531
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,679
>> Yeah. So, so, so that's that that's an

532
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,120
interesting situation where uh it's hard

533
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
to be a spiritual successor when you're

534
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,559
competing against the original

535
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,120
tournament. Uh, but you know, you can

536
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,520
think of them

537
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,640
>> by that dragon I mean not competing

538
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
spiritual success with Dragon Age

539
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,799
because they don't have the right gate

540
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,520
anymore.

541
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:12,080
>> Uh, yeah. Well, Dragon Age is more of a

542
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,440
DND clone I would say. Uh, which

543
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,480
>> yeah, I guess

544
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,080
>> Empire Earth is reinvented itself with

545
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,559
with Empire Earth. Empire

546
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,120
>> with with zero success doing wonder.

547
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
>> Oh. Uh I kind of lost track of this. You

548
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,360
>> in the whole game the whole game the

549
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
first game was like you can go through

550
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,720
15 ages. We will like model you can

551
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,840
literally play a game against someone

552
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,280
and go from prehistoric units to nukes

553
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,520
>> in the same game with everything in

554
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,799
between. And then they release a sequel

555
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
which I think overseas and then they

556
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,600
decide to read it themselves and go

557
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,200
we're going to simplify everything.

558
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,960
there's just going to be like four ages

559
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
kind of like in ancient empires and

560
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
we're not going to have this like

561
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,520
massive progression and and they try to

562
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,240
simplify everything and it totally

563
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,240
>> you see I think that's a reboot

564
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
>> but but but I think that's that's that's

565
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,160
a reboot gone wrong that's that that

566
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,960
that's a our original game is not

567
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,440
selling well enough among new players it

568
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
maybe and it's not entirely satisfying

569
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,640
our old fans. So, we're going to take

570
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,880
this franchise that we've advertised

571
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,960
really, really well. Uh, and we're going

572
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,640
to make a completely effectively a new

573
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,960
game, maybe with the same theme, but but

574
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,480
a new game that's targeted at a new set

575
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,280
of players. Sometimes it works,

576
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,679
sometimes it bombs. Um, Mind of Magic

577
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,440
released a game called Clash of Heroes.

578
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,640
Might Magic. Clash of Heroes for the

579
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,000
Nintendo DS. And who's played any of the

580
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
original Mind and Magic games?

581
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,080
>> They're different from Heroes of Mind of

582
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,320
Magic.

583
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,240
>> Uh,

584
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,440
either of them, actually. So, who's the

585
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,520
Heroes of Mind of Magic?

586
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,159
>> Okay. Can you describe the game?

587
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
>> What's it like?

588
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,559
>> Do you want to go for it?

589
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,400
>> Well, it's like a it's essentially just

590
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,480
a turn-based strategy game

591
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,559
>> where you have cities and you have

592
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,200
heroes and these heroes lead armies and

593
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,280
you encounter other smaller armies and

594
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
try and defeat them and stuff. And you

595
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
have like

596
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
>> and build up your city and turn to have

597
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
you have an economy.

598
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,520
>> Yeah. you have an economy and and you

599
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,000
you build things in your city that can

600
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,679
then like produce better units for your

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
armies and stuff and you can take over

602
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,039
other cities and

603
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,440
>> so

604
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,440
civilization I would say

605
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,200
>> yeah it's it's like civilization but

606
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,240
if you took civilization removed

607
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,080
everything that wasn't like military

608
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,360
>> and battles are played out we sort of

609
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,200
distinctive like arena

610
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,039
>> yeah you have like a battlefield field

611
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
where it's turnbased and you have your

612
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,000
units on one side and the opponent's

613
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,919
units on the other side and you move

614
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
units together. So like if you have, you

615
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,039
know, Pikeman and Bowman, you have like

616
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
the clump of all Bowman who then move

617
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,679
together as a unit and so on and so

618
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,320
forth.

619
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:51,360
>> So Clash of Heroes is a Nintendo DS game

620
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,799
in the in the Might Magic series. And

621
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,520
what they did was they made a match

622
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,000
three game. They made a game where you

623
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,720
it's like Bejeweled. You take three

624
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,480
Bowman, put them in a row, and then they

625
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
become a bunch of Bowmen who are going

626
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,200
to attack. Uh, so they they get the same

627
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
idea of let's take and because of

628
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Nintendo DS, there are two screens, so

629
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
the enemies uh armies are on one and

630
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,559
yours are on the other just kind of like

631
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,799
sending troops up and down. Uh, but the

632
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,440
game play is dramatically different. Uh,

633
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,000
it's effectively a franchise reboot. Uh,

634
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,400
they they they want to sort of get the

635
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,080
same idea of, you know, leading massive

636
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
armies against each other. I think they

637
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,360
take some of the characters or at least

638
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,559
some of the technologies that came from

639
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,400
the original heroes might m magic. Um

640
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,600
but that that that's as far as it got.

641
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,679
Everything else that everything else

642
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
they changed because they're going for a

643
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,880
completely different audience. The the

644
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,559
assumption being Nintendo DS players

645
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,960
like match three games. Um like Joel. Um

646
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,159
it's actually really good. I I I will

647
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,840
encourage you if you like match three

648
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,679
games. Um, so,

649
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,679
uh, I was going to put Sarah on the

650
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,559
spot, uh, for, uh, having worked on, uh,

651
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,159
Thief 2 and Thief Gold and Thief Two

652
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,159
Gold and, uh, a number of, uh, of

653
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,360
releases, but you can start telling us a

654
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,960
little bit about your original

655
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,799
involvement on Thief.

656
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,760
>> Sure. Uh, you're going to stand up so

657
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,400
you can actually hear me.

658
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,480
>> I can bring the microphone.

659
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,760
>> Um, so, um, Thief, the dark project, um,

660
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,720
I came on as actually as lead tester. Um

661
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,000
partway through it I became QA manager

662
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,200
essentially and then I actually stepped

663
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,720
into design role um for about the second

664
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,559
half of the project. Um and I continued

665
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,000
to work as a design designer and a

666
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,679
project manager on thief 2 and uh thief.

667
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,120
>> What were you designing in thief?

668
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,520
>> Um in thief one I was pretty

669
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,960
specifically designing gameplay for a

670
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,200
level that someone else had already

671
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,000
built. building levels took a lot longer

672
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
than putting in gameplay. Um, at least

673
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,919
from my point of view, I think the

674
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,280
person who built it thought that

675
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,440
building levels was a lot faster than

676
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,960
putting in gameplay. Um, so it was a

677
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,799
good combination, but it was built by an

678
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,840
artist who didn't have the scripting

679
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,200
experience or the testing patients to go

680
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,039
through and make sure that all the exper

681
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,039
the gameplay experience was working. So,

682
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,120
I was basically handed the level and

683
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,440
said, "Okay, make it fun."

684
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,039
>> Now, Thief is a first person stealth

685
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,960
game. Basically, you're looking through

686
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
the eyes of a thief who is not

687
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,559
physically all that robust, but uh he

688
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,520
can sneak and uh he can shoot arrows

689
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,880
usually at your back uh and you know and

690
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,400
hide. So,

691
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,559
>> and the AI is unlike in most games where

692
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,799
AI is tuned to sort of aha we noticed

693
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,919
you, we recharge you. The AI is is

694
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,200
carefully tuned to both tell the player

695
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,720
if the AI sort of notices you if the AI

696
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
thinks he's looking for you and is

697
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,880
looking for you and if he's actually

698
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,799
coming after you so that a player who

699
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,480
makes a noise while sneaking up on them

700
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,159
will realize that oh he noticed that I

701
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,000
should go be more quiet. Um so uh the AI

702
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,600
feedback and tuning the AIS was actually

703
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
really pretty important to playing

704
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,240
experience apart. If you didn't give the

705
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,720
player an avenue to approach a guard

706
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,679
from behind or to sneak up on them in

707
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,279
some way, you were pretty much

708
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,679
guaranteeing the player would get play

709
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:14,400
get killed because the player could not

710
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,840
in fact take one guard on one to one um

711
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
many times. You could probably kill one

712
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
guard face to face, but then he'd be

713
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,440
sufficiently wounded that the second

714
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,840
fight would finish off. So, you had to

715
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,840
be giving the player uh channels and

716
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
ways to sneak up and places to hide and

717
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,480
things like that if you wanted to have

718
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,600
an interesting game. a challenge.

719
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
>> And that's the gameplay tweaks that

720
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
you're talking about.

721
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,880
>> Those are the gameplay tweaks I'm

722
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,600
talking about. Yeah. Placing AIs,

723
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,720
determining their paths. Um, putting

724
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,520
actually this little particular level

725
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,840
had a lot of traps in it. So, um,

726
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,400
creating the traps and then giving clues

727
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,760
to the player in game so that they could

728
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,120
a either notice the trap was there

729
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,840
before getting hit by it and, uh, find

730
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,039
some other way to trigger it or, um,

731
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,320
notice that it was there or notice it

732
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,760
was there and then discover how to get

733
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,200
out of it.

734
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,400
Thief is a uh 199

735
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,279
>> 198 at this point.

736
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,440
>> 199 1996 was it was it was released

737
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,520
around the same time Doom was.

738
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,720
>> And and it's pretty impressive because

739
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,159
in Doom you can't look up. I believe you

740
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,880
can shoot them but you can't.

741
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,400
>> Yeah. In in Thief you can crouch, you

742
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,840
can lean around corners. Um you can in

743
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,960
fact shoot your bow while leaning around

744
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,720
corners and Yeah. um you can look up and

745
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,440
down and all around. So yeah.

746
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,039
>> So that's Thief one. How what happens

747
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,400
when Thief 2 gets approved or you know

748
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,480
>> um well the first thing I need to do is

749
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,240
convince people they want to do Thief 2

750
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,320
because while Thief was a great game and

751
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,799
it has actually sold fairly well over

752
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,919
time. Its initial sales were not what

753
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,360
publishers want to see because the

754
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
initial sales the publisher wants to see

755
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,760
is oh my god it sold 10 million copies.

756
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Awesome. Instead, what we did was we

757
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,120
sold a fairly good first initial sell

758
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
through and then it just kind of kept

759
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,240
going. So, the first thing we had to do

760
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,760
was convince them that yes, Thief 2

761
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,120
would be a good idea. Enough people are

762
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,559
continuing to buy Thief 1 that those

763
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,640
same people will all run out and buy

764
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,159
Thief 2 on the very first day. Um, and

765
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
the way we did that was first of all

766
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,039
taking a look at forums and saying,

767
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,240
"Hey, look, people are pretty excited

768
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,840
about this. They're enjoying it. It's

769
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,039
got good lasting power. Our fans are

770
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,960
going to stick around to play with it a

771
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,279
second time." And that was sort of a

772
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,360
marketing and analysis that kind of went

773
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,559
into the publisher. And the other part

774
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,760
was saying, okay, what are the

775
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
improvements we're going to make to this

776
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,000
game? How are we going to change this

777
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,039
game to make it better than Thief 1

778
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
while still taking advantage of

779
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,679
everything we did? So, we created

780
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,960
basically a big design doc with here are

781
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,240
the areas that we thought we could have

782
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,919
done better in Thief 1. Here's what

783
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,200
we're going to prove. And here are the

784
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,039
changes we're going to make. So, we're

785
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
not going to make Thief 1 again. We're

786
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,440
going to take what Thief One was, add

787
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,320
some improvements to it, make a deeper

788
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,840
story, and hopefully give a more variety

789
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,279
of gameplay was what we actually ended

790
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,120
up aiming for in our initial docs. Um,

791
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,200
was we wanted to give Garrett additional

792
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,120
abilities, give him a little bit, give

793
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,000
him give vary the gameplay. The gameplay

794
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,919
in Thief 1 was all speed. We tried to

795
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,799
have some additional types of missions

796
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,399
in Thief 2. It's been long enough that

797
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,720
there was a little more face-to-face

798
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,799
fighting. there was a little more um

799
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,600
subtrafuge instead of just sneaking

800
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,120
around. We also had okay so now you need

801
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
to disguise yourself to someone and

802
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,799
sneak in and sneak out again because you

803
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,640
need to achieve you need to pass for

804
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,320
them while getting a goal done and

805
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,600
things like that. So we tried to find

806
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,320
what are additional stealth and

807
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,799
subtrauge um issues in gameplay we can

808
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,360
have.

809
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,840
>> How many of those features in teeth do

810
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,679
were inherited from like dropped

811
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,960
features of teeth or ideas? A lot of

812
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,640
them, a lot of them inherited from

813
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,000
dropped ideas from Thief 1, but when we

814
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,279
first when they first started designing

815
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,080
Thief, and I was not on the initial

816
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,440
Thief design team, so now I'm I'm making

817
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,480
up what they were talking about. Um, it

818
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,760
wasn't clear that it was going to be it

819
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,679
was it was sort of like it's going to be

820
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,440
a stealthy e game, but we hadn't

821
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,200
actually defined what stealthy gameplay

822
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,559
was yet. So, um, it was Thief one that

823
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,480
kind of told us what this is what

824
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,080
stealth play is that works. And once we

825
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,279
found the one or two things that worked

826
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,039
and kind of went with that and hung with

827
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,720
that, it was a thief too. We got to play

828
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,919
around with what are some other ideas of

829
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,480
selfie gameplay. What are some other

830
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,640
ways to trick people into

831
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,159
if people have played Metal Gear Solid

832
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,399
or any of the games in the Metal Gear

833
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,600
Solid series, it always a lot of

834
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,360
especially the really really noisy NPCs.

835
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,840
You want I heard something. I wonder

836
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,360
what's over there. That's awesome.

837
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,279
>> DSX also.

838
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,480
>> But but DSX also also got

839
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,640
>> Yes. Well, that's what I'm saying is

840
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,320
that DSX also actually took a lot of

841
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
thieves lessons and went on with them

842
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,279
from there.

843
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
>> Again, a lot of people working on thief

844
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,440
DSX

845
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,240
>> uh DSX 2 or DSX 2, but yeah, um Looking

846
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,960
Glass folded and went out of business

847
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,159
and um a lot of people moved to Austin

848
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,720
to then work on Thief 3 and DSX 2 and

849
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,080
and and those projects there. So,

850
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,120
>> um I have a question about um the gold

851
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,520
the gold version.

852
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,480
>> The gold version. the gold versions of

853
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,240
the games are um really a way to try to

854
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,600
convince from the marketing point of

855
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,679
view is a way to convince players to buy

856
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,279
the same material again. So it was it

857
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,960
was I'm being a little cynical here and

858
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,960
I admit that. Um but we added new we did

859
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,279
in fact add what we did was we added

860
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,080
several new missions. So, it was

861
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,360
expanded play and then we went back and

862
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,360
problems that we knew were in the

863
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,679
missions, we fixed them and we actually

864
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,960
added some richer gameplay to several of

865
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,919
the missions that, oh god, we have to

866
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,120
take this out the door. We have to take

867
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,480
this out the door. This would be so cool

868
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,640
if we could set this up, but we don't

869
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,679
have time to. And out it goes. And so,

870
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,960
we went back and we touched up over half

871
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,480
of the missions. We added some

872
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,039
additional gameplay. We added extra

873
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,320
goals. We added we took areas where we

874
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,320
thought the gameplay was particularly

875
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,279
weak because we'd gotten rushed on

876
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,799
finishing it. and we made the levels a

877
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,120
bit longer and a little more interesting

878
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,559
in our opinion. And then we also added

879
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,600
three new levels in. It was kind of a

880
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,200
chance. It was a doover. Um, we had very

881
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
limited programming resources, so we

882
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,039
didn't really need to add any add in

883
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,039
much in the way of new features, but we

884
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,120
were able to go back and tune it and

885
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,960
make significant changes to the levels,

886
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,799
to the way that the guards worked, to

887
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,039
the scripting behind the levels. If

888
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,320
anyone's working on a 3D mod, you know,

889
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,399
there's usually a fair bit that a

890
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,120
designer can do behind the behind the

891
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,120
walls of of telling the AIs what to do

892
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,039
and how to think and how the gameplay

893
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,840
flows. And Thief especially had an

894
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,440
extremely rich editor that u more

895
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,200
powerful, I think, than any other editor

896
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,159
I've ever worked with. Even though it is

897
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,640
now 15 or 20 years old, 15 years old, I

898
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,080
think, um, it's still the most powerful

899
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,559
editor for a designer that I've ever

900
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,440
seen.

901
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,039
>> So, um, Do you feel that in like how

902
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,200
much you you mentioned you looked at the

903
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,240
forums and you looked at pan input and

904
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,000
how much of that of what went into

905
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,799
creating the sequels actually came from

906
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
pan input or was it just like verifying

907
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,440
what you already wanted to do?

908
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,039
>> Part of it was to verify what we wanted

909
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,159
to do. Part of it was to verify there

910
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,840
was enough interest that people would

911
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,360
want to do it. Part of it was to see

912
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,440
what did people like most? Which of the

913
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,200
missions did people like most? And what

914
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,440
are there any good ideas out there for

915
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,039
how to play how to play a game that we

916
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,480
think yes, you know, they're right. We

917
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,760
never thought of that. I think that one

918
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,600
of the things people talked about a lot

919
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,440
was actually disguise missions. And I

920
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,799
think we had two disguise missions in

921
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,600
Thief 2 where you kind of disguise

922
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,360
yourself as as no, no, nobody look at

923
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,039
me. I'm I'm just another guard walking

924
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,279
around. Don't worry about me. Um,

925
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,960
and that was something that we said, oh

926
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,240
yeah, that would be really cool. And

927
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,640
that's something we had no time to

928
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
implement for Thief. But if we're

929
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,039
choosing our if we're choosing which

930
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,559
features new features to implement for

931
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,960
thief too, that was actually not an

932
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,159
amazingly difficult one because you just

933
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,840
figure out a way to put a tag on the

934
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,519
player that says, "Oh, guards don't get

935
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,559
upset when you see them."

936
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,720
>> Did you have uh situations where players

937
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,399
came out with exploits that you tried to

938
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,799
address in the gold version?

939
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,159
>> There were not. No, actually there were

940
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,200
a couple of places where people found

941
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,519
bugs that were um level enders that got

942
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
people stuck that we went in and fixed.

943
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,679
There were not a whole lot of exploits

944
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,640
um that I recall us trying to get in and

945
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,159
fix.

946
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,440
>> So if somebody like deliberately found

947
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,440
something that put them on the roof of

948
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
the castle or something like that that

949
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,640
you didn't bother trying to

950
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,840
>> um if it if it allowed the player to get

951
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,039
to the place where it broke the game, we

952
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,399
did try to fix it because we tried to

953
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,840
fix anything that was a game breaker

954
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,120
where you could get up on the wall and

955
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,440
then leap off into the void. Um, but

956
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,960
sometimes what we do is rather than stop

957
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,960
you from getting up on the castle and

958
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,399
proving how cool you were, we'd let you

959
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,559
get up on the castle, but we put

960
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,720
invisible barrier so you couldn't hurl

961
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,559
yourself into the darkness and then

962
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,399
crash the game. So, right there, if

963
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,399
players enjoy finding those things, so

964
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,480
taking them out doesn't taking them out

965
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,640
doesn't enhance the gameplay. And the

966
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,399
point of the goal project was to try to

967
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
make something where the gameplay was

968
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,000
sufficiently enhanced that it was

969
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,080
worthwhile to go out and buy again.

970
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,640
>> So now we're in an environment where

971
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,240
patches are pretty much just downloaded,

972
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,120
right? We don't we don't necessarily

973
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,679
have that situation in the early 90s. Uh

974
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,840
is there still a rule of space called

975
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,120
gold versions re-releases?

976
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,360
>> I think now again that would be an

977
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,800
expansion pack. I don't think I don't

978
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,679
think that you would do a gold version.

979
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,359
you do an expansion pack and with a with

980
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,040
an expansion pack patch you could fix

981
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,399
old problems and you might introduce new

982
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,560
versions of levels but I don't think you

983
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,320
go through the hassle of doing you just

984
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,070
expansion pack

985
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,879
>> thanks

986
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:27,040
[Applause]

987
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,200
questions for

988
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,200
your experience

989
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,960
>> so pretty much all your dat

990
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,320
forums we

991
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,679
>> oh no oh no that was just one of the

992
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,879
places where we looked we also looked at

993
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,480
sales

994
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,760
and continued sales and things like

995
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,760
that. Like I said, that was actually

996
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,839
more of a marketing sales to sort of do

997
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,200
here's the hard here's why we think

998
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,359
players will like it. Here's some

999
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,879
experiences we got. Here's the hard data

1000
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,079
on our sales, how our sales are

1001
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,760
continuing. Um, and the fact that Thief

1002
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
is having while it did not come out and

1003
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,119
sell 100,000 copies the first month,

1004
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,800
it's continuing to sell 20 or 30,000

1005
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,800
copies a month, which means that word of

1006
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,320
mouth is pretty strong and people are

1007
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
continuing to go out and buy it and go

1008
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,480
out and play it. And here's the forum

1009
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
where a whole bunch of people are using

1010
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,359
the editor we released and the activity

1011
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,359
in that forum is going up over time, not

1012
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,880
down over time, which indicates you've

1013
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,800
got more people coming into it. People

1014
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,400
are coming in, they're staying at it and

1015
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,920
using it. And you've got more people

1016
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,119
continuing to come in. The community is

1017
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,480
growing, which is means that there's

1018
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,400
interest there and there's people who

1019
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,160
are paying attention to project continue

1020
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,839
to pay attention to product.

1021
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,400
>> But also for gameplay, for finding dead

1022
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,160
ends, for finding So you said you fixed

1023
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,880
some dead ends of games you found out

1024
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,920
about those. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well,

1025
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,760
the difference between a Let me think.

1026
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
At our height, we had a 12 person QA

1027
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:51,760
department.

1028
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:54,079
Um, and 50,000 users is pretty big. Um,

1029
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,119
I we did our best on testing it and we

1030
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,920
had like another 10 or 15 helpers

1031
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,400
through our publisher, but

1032
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,560
I mean, we had comparatively speaking a

1033
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,320
ridiculously small QA department for for

1034
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,520
the game. But then you have a situation

1035
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
where someone does something on the

1036
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,680
forum and then you can verify it when

1037
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,640
you give it to.

1038
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
>> Yeah.

1039
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
>> Yeah.

1040
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
>> And you can actually figure out whether

1041
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
what they were seeing was exactly the

1042
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,880
problem they were describing.

1043
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,119
>> And it being a solely single player

1044
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,960
game. I know a lot of games do um you

1045
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,119
know beta do large beta tests where they

1046
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,359
ask you know 500 200 or a thousand

1047
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,119
people to to play the game. We did not

1048
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,320
do any external testing like that at

1049
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,040
all.

1050
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
>> Yeah.

1051
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,599
>> Also back in the 90s that would have

1052
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,760
>> also Yeah. It was not the sort of thing

1053
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,320
that was really done in the 90s as well.

1054
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
So, it's a it's very much a

1055
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,440
developmental shift.

1056
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,119
>> Did you ever explicitly ask on the

1057
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,040
forums like if there were another

1058
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,680
sequel, would you buy it

1059
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,720
>> or did you just

1060
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,480
>> I don't know. I did not do that. Um,

1061
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,160
>> I was not on the forums. I helped some

1062
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,160
of the forum data and read forums, but I

1063
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
didn't really post on the forums a lot.

1064
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
>> Um,

1065
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,920
>> do you think that'd be a viable tactic

1066
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,640
or would you just say people would

1067
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
probably just say

1068
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,839
>> I think that your data would be very

1069
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,119
good. Okay. I mean, the most you're

1070
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,320
probably going to get is a thousand

1071
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,680
people who read the forum say yes and

1072
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,280
that's a thousand people and that's um

1073
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,640
not enough sales to justify doing

1074
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,079
anything.

1075
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
>> It's more interesting. I think it's more

1076
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,119
useful to look at trends like if you've

1077
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,440
got like a survey out maybe. I don't

1078
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,400
know. I've seen I've seen companies

1079
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,720
bring in focus groups of their people

1080
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,839
who played the first game to come in and

1081
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,920
they're bouncing off either prototypes

1082
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,760
or features that they're planning for

1083
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,160
the second version to see how they will

1084
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,280
respond to them. I would say that the

1085
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,000
information you get back from that is

1086
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,680
also not very good. Um, but it might be

1087
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,400
something that is done to gain traction

1088
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,400
in internal studio politics. And I was

1089
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,079
like, well, we did this exercise where

1090
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
we brought these people in and they said

1091
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,280
these features are okay, so we can take

1092
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,079
the risk of actually developing it as

1093
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,440
opposed to, you know, saying driving the

1094
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,280
entire process of

1095
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,800
>> games. Games don't respond really well

1096
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,000
to um focus test based development.

1097
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,040
Well, focus group.

1098
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,040
>> Focus group based group development. Um,

1099
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,880
getting feedback on your games is great.

1100
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,560
Um, finding out how many people are

1101
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,200
likely to like your game is a lot

1102
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
harder,

1103
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,160
>> especially if they never if they can't

1104
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,760
actually see it when you ask them that

1105
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,359
question. Uh, then they have no idea uh

1106
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,440
what they're commenting on. You'll make

1107
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,359
something up that they think you want to

1108
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,960
hear. Uh, it's like, "Yes, of course,

1109
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,160
we'll buy a copy of the game. We love

1110
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,200
the first one. Sure." You know, but

1111
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,520
they've never actually seen the second

1112
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,440
version of the game. of you. So you

1113
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,680
don't actually know that the case. Um

1114
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,960
for those of you who do miss Iran Goi's

1115
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,680
talk uh last week uh he was talking

1116
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,520
about how um in amplitude which was a

1117
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,079
sequel amplitude or frequency

1118
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
>> frequency

1119
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,839
>> frequency is the first one amplitude.

1120
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,160
>> Oh yeah I think it wasn't the very first

1121
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,280
one. So that was frequency. uh he was

1122
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,200
talking about how uh how the folks from

1123
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,640
Sunny were helping them run their their

1124
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,640
focus groups and um and they did two

1125
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,480
tests and one of the tests was you know

1126
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,240
after they played the game they would

1127
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,839
they did a survey of how many people

1128
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,200
were planning on buying this when it

1129
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,880
came out and they had like some

1130
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,599
ridiculously high score like 80% or

1131
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,440
something like that like the highest

1132
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,960
but they also did a survey of how many

1133
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,440
people were planning on buying the game

1134
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,560
just by looking at the box before they

1135
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,800
played the game and that was a

1136
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,079
ridiculous be no number and it's only

1137
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,079
and it's only people called it. It's

1138
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,520
like this is not going to sell because

1139
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,040
you know sure the people who played your

1140
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,920
game are going to enjoy your game but no

1141
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,680
one's going to play your game in the

1142
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,680
first place because people can't figure

1143
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,200
out what what your game's about and you

1144
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,960
try to address those problems with the

1145
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,960
sequel. Uh that's that uh that's one

1146
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
thing Brenda talks about your your

1147
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
chance to do a doo a chance for you to

1148
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,320
go back and fix the problems that you

1149
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,640
found in the first one especially when

1150
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,320
you find those problems really close to

1151
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,200
ship date. There's nothing that you can

1152
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,640
do about for the first time around, but

1153
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,079
if you're lucky, you get a second chance

1154
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,160
to do it.

1155
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,640
>> Yeah. I also noticed that frequency was

1156
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,839
not called in or rather it wasn't um

1157
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,280
frequency too.

1158
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,800
>> It was it wasn't frequency too. They

1159
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,560
called it amplitude. So, it was actually

1160
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,000
kind of a reboot as well. It was like

1161
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,599
they kind of just wanted people, okay,

1162
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,280
let's pretend frequency didn't happen

1163
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,280
and that's we'll make sure that the

1164
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
frequency people who love the game know

1165
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,920
that

1166
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,880
>> have a ton. Yeah. It's much easier to to

1167
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,040
tell the a small base who liked you, oh

1168
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,480
yeah, and buy this game than it is to

1169
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,839
say to tell a large group of people who

1170
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,200
weren't interested the first time, no,

1171
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,400
no, you didn't like it the first time,

1172
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,720
but trust us, you'll like it this time.

1173
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:35,040
Um I've seen a couple of uh companies do

1174
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,040
uh effectively uh go versions every time

1175
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,560
they move to a new platform like the

1176
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,320
latest platform which they release it

1177
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,400
from tends to become the definitive

1178
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,160
version that if you're a big fan of the

1179
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,920
franchise and you're willing to buy this

1180
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,119
game multiple times you want to get that

1181
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,079
because of a few extra features that

1182
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,040
they put in. Maybe it's different

1183
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,560
endings. Maybe it's upgraded cut scenes.

1184
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,359
Uh if it's a role playing game I see

1185
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,960
that a lot. uh maybe they redided the

1186
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,280
cut scene from scratch or reded the

1187
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,760
audio from from from scratch. So it's

1188
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,480
the same assets but clearer and science

1189
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,000
higher resolution. And of course, you

1190
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,760
have games that uh that started off

1191
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
their lives as online flash games and

1192
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,400
stuff like that and then get moved on to

1193
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,119
other platforms like DS or PSP. And

1194
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,800
those those games tend to have not only

1195
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,200
completely reworked controls because

1196
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,560
controls are different um but also a lot

1197
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,200
more features because you have to now

1198
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,200
justify to people who may have loved the

1199
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,040
game but didn't pay any money for the

1200
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,839
first version to actually put down money

1201
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,280
for it now. Um so N is a good example of

1202
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:35,200
that. It's one is a game that came out

1203
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,359
by Xbox live arcade. um and did DS and

1204
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,760
PSP but started it live as a free flash

1205
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,040
game and lots of people loved it but

1206
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,440
lots of people didn't have to pay any

1207
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,440
money for the first version so how much

1208
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,079
they love it is uh kind of a weird

1209
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,319
factor

1210
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,800
okay so well that's not really

1211
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,280
I guess we should start with the games

1212
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,280
more questions
