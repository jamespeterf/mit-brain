Technology has transformed the outlook

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,240
for the disabled. The main problem of

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,880
communicating for people like me who

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,519
can't speak is what is called the baud

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,480
rate. That is the rate at which

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,039
information can be conveyed. One might

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,760
be able to operate a switch two or three

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,480
times a second. This would mean that one

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,119
could send information at a rate of two

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,920
or three bits a second. One bit of

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,760
information is the answer to a yes no

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,559
question. By contrast, normal speech has

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,559
an information flow rate of between 50

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,600
and 75 bits a second. However, the real

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,520
information flow in human speech is much

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,640
less than this. In the case of political

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,640
speeches, it is practically zero.
