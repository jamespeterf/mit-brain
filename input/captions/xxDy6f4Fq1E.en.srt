1
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Someone's

2
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,360
here. Yeah.

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Experienc

4
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,479
Yes.

5
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,879
We started at 5. I know you have famous,

6
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,200
right? I quarter costume. So, I've got

7
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,200
my tea time.

8
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,120
Van's a legend.

9
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
every

10
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,000
classroom time and it's all always best.

11
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,879
different technology.

12
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,840
25

13
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,120
I wonder who that is.

14
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,120
Wonder if there's any connection.

15
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,050
[Music]

16
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,680
One more minute.

17
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,599
Just for a second,

18
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,760
[Music]

19
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm

20
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,360
not sharing.

21
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,840
Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,840
I know.

23
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Stop.

24
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,280
We should probably get started. So,

25
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,400
thanks to all of you for being here.

26
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
Those of you who are on Zoom, thank you

27
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
also for being here. It's very exciting

28
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
for me to get to hear what you, the grad

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,960
students here, are working on. I'm

30
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
hoping I will understand some words of

31
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,600
it. And our first speaker is Angus,

32
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,199
who's going to talk about materials for

33
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,240
fusion energy and the Kevlab. Thank you.

34
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
Um, so I'm the first speaker, so I get

35
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
uh to introduce all of the fusion stuff

36
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,280
to you uh this fusion energy week. Um,

37
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,080
first things first, I'm just going to go

38
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,440
over what fusion is, what are our

39
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,160
requirements, and then a little bit

40
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:37,039
about what we do in the lab. Um so first

41
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,759
of all uh this is a slice of the EA TOK

42
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,840
uh which is like the next big nuclear

43
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,120
fusion device in south of France. Uh

44
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,199
it's about 6 m in major radius which is

45
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
the uh

46
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
distance from the center of the plasma

47
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
over to the to the center of the um of

48
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
the device. So it's kind of like this

49
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
doughut shaped device and you're

50
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
squishing your plasma inside the donut.

51
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,639
So this is a cross-section of that

52
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,720
doughut. slicing into it and seeing um

53
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,880
our plasma which is our main way of

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,880
creating fusion damage.

55
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,319
Um the plasma itself is made up of

56
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,319
hydrogen. So dutaterium and tritium

57
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
which are heavy heavy hydrogen we smash

58
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,759
them together uh and hope that they

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,919
stick together and get our energy out.

60
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,680
You want to do this you got to have all

61
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,199
this stuff around it to make it not just

62
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
fly out. Right? you've got lots of

63
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,800
positively charged stuff in there and

64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
you're trying to squish it and make them

65
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
go together but they really don't want

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
to go together uh because light charges

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,479
recover. So around that we've got a lot

68
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,520
uh a lot of plasma facing components

69
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,280
which experience a lot of heat. Uh the

70
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,120
core itself is like ultra high

71
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,720
temperatures 100 million Celsius. Um and

72
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
the plasma facing components themselves

73
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
don't get that hot because nothing

74
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,440
nothing can get that hot. Uh but they

75
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
are at thousands of Celsius. And then

76
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
around those plasma facing components,

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,039
you got to have something to hold it up

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,960
and keep the vacuum uh that's required

79
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,800
for this at vacuum level. So, we've got

80
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,440
a vacuum vessel and then also we've got

81
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,440
some magnets around the outside uh that

82
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
sort of squish everything together and

83
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,800
make our plasma behave the way we want

84
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,080
it to. And that's a very sort of rushed

85
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
overview, but the point I'm trying to

86
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,440
make here is that everything in there is

87
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,840
made up of a lot of materials. Uh so

88
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,599
we've got uh superconductors and the

89
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
magnets which themselves are like these

90
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,440
complex layered uh structures. Uh these

91
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,280
superconducting tapes. uh the vacuum

92
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,240
vessel itself is made up of many things

93
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,479
that are all welded together. Uh the

94
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,479
plum facing components has a lot of uh

95
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
cooling and a lot of candidate materials

96
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,240
that could be there. All of which have

97
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,199
to be evaluated and then that's not even

98
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,160
talking about uh cooling or breeding of

99
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,319
fuel uh which in itself is a is a huge

100
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
challenge we're working on here. Um

101
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,039
there's a lot of stuff and they all have

102
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,879
to survive what is created by by the

103
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,199
plasma itself. When we do fusion, we get

104
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
a lot of energy. Hooray. And we also get

105
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,759
a lot of radiation, which is both our

106
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
best friend and worst enemy. Radiation

107
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
is how we get out energy out. But it

108
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,599
also does a lot of damage to our

109
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,599
materials as well. So that's kind of me

110
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,599
singing for my supper. Why do we

111
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,199
actually care about radiation material

112
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,039
science and what we do in our lab? We

113
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
need to know how how our device is going

114
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,240
to behave. So what do they do? What do

115
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,680
these what do these things do uh in the

116
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,120
material? Uh, for example, a neutron can

117
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,199
come in, hit our nice, in this case, uh,

118
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,680
crystalline material.

119
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,240
All of our hard work forging, melting,

120
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,800
heat treating. We spent so much effort,

121
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,399
uh, making this nice omelette. And then

122
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,839
the neutron comes in and turns it into

123
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,839
scrambled egg. Um, so it's just it comes

124
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,519
in, it can knock atoms around, it can

125
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
transmute atoms. Where the neutron is

126
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
absorbed, it turns into something else.

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
Uh, which has a lot of knock-on effects.

128
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,680
But there's a lot of extra stuff that

129
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,080
can happen inside a material uh that can

130
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,080
degrade it.

131
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,680
Secondly, in the plasma facing

132
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,320
components, we've also got this idea of

133
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,519
uh erosion. So something extremely hot

134
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,279
and extremely uh we use plasma elsewhere

135
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,959
in industry to erode materials and

136
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,320
redeposit them elsewhere. You know, like

137
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
that's how we do all of our

138
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
semiconductor manufacturing. You just

139
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
fire plasma or something and let it

140
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,880
sputter away. So we don't want that to

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,560
happen but it wants to happen very much.

142
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,959
Um so what we do is what can happen is

143
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,959
the plasma itself which is typically

144
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,680
hydrogen or helium. Helium is the the

145
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,680
waste uh from the fing process. Uh

146
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,959
helium can go into the material and at

147
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
high temperatures it can form these

148
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,279
bubbles uh in this case in tungsten

149
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
which is one of the candida materials

150
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,640
for the plasm facing components and it

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
can form these like bubbles which can

152
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,560
then grow and then rupture and they make

153
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
this fuzzy

154
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,480
stuff on the surface. Um which is not

155
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
great because you don't want little bits

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
to break off and start whizzing around

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
inside your plasma. That will waste a

158
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
lot of energy.

159
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,560
Um so what does this actually do?

160
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
radiation damage stuff. This is just

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,360
some examples of kind of like how bad

162
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,000
how bad could it be. Um

163
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,279
you can get why do we like metals in in

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,160
structural materials? Because they can

165
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,240
flex a little bit and not break. Um but

166
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,360
in radio radioactive environments your

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,120
metals can go from being very ductile in

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,480
this case. So here they can this is a

169
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,279
plot of energy to energy to breakage and

170
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,600
temperature. So for a normal material it

171
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,880
can absorb a lot of energy at room

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
temperature.

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,320
uh and not break. Whereas if you irdiate

174
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
this, this has just been taken into a

175
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,800
vision reactor for some amount of time.

176
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,519
If you radiate these, you can start to

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,279
have this what's called a hell fracture,

178
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
brittle fracture rather than ductile

179
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,399
fracture. So when you when something

180
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,600
starts to break, you want it to like

181
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,640
bend a little bit. You don't want it to

182
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
just snap. So big degradation there. You

183
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,640
can also get swelling, which is a bit

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,120
more intuitive. Uh your materials can

185
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,120
grow as little gaps inside them uh

186
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,959
coalesce. you and if you've made things

187
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
to a certain tolerance which they

188
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,600
definitely will be in these in these

189
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,160
fusion devices then this can just

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
completely ruin that you get a loss of

191
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,240
thermal properties as uh like I was

192
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
showing in the previous slide your

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,040
crystine structure gets all messed up

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,440
and your electrons which generally carry

195
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,800
all of your heat and electricity in some

196
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,240
cases uh it can't flow as well so you

197
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
can get a loss of thermal properties in

198
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,640
this case you've got neutron dose on the

199
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
x axis here and thermal conductivity on

200
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,399
the y axis so you can it drops by a

201
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,720
factor of 4 plus over over some

202
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,200
exposure. So you want to know what's

203
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,920
going to happen here. Um

204
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,720
how do we actually figure that out? So

205
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,279
in our lab uh we have a look at various

206
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,360
uh various material properties. I'll

207
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,519
just go kind of through the various beam

208
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
lines uh in the lab which is an

209
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,440
accelerator lab. So at the back here

210
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,880
we've got the accelerator itself. Uh

211
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,240
this is the thing that makes our ions

212
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,240
and we can hit our materials with our

213
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,240
ions and just see see what happens. Uh

214
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,240
on the left we have a corrosion beam

215
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,440
line. I was mentioning coolant and fuel

216
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,120
breathing earlier. Um those things if

217
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
you have something that's effectively if

218
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,600
you imagine what corrosion is, it's your

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,600
material comes in it interacts with the

220
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
surface and then it goes away and

221
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,560
carries some material away with it.

222
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
Perhaps if you have lots of radiation

223
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,880
kind of like moving things around, it's

224
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,480
just it's effectively like stirring your

225
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,800
uh stirring your cup of tea with a with

226
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,600
a spoonful of sugar in it. It just helps

227
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,959
that process along or you know you can

228
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
you can grasp that it helps things

229
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,480
along. So we need to assess how that's

230
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
happening.

231
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,120
One of the backbones of the modern

232
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,200
design is the superconductor. We don't

233
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,519
really know how radiation affects that

234
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,560
very well and if that's like your most

235
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,639
expensive critical showstopper, you kind

236
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
of want to know how that's going to go.

237
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,040
Um, so we have a beam line that looks at

238
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,600
how radiation affects those uh those

239
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,519
materials. Uh, and we also have this uh

240
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
we also have this plasma device that can

241
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,680
do simultaneous radiation and plasma

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,200
exposure at the same time for pl for

243
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,279
plasma facing components to evaluate

244
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,600
them. And on the right, we also have

245
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,279
some a laser technique that we can use

246
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,760
to evaluate things as they're being

247
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,760
damaged at the same time. Go over that.

248
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,160
Um,

249
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,360
okay. So, the corrosion stuff, we have

250
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,120
this little cell. You've got uh liquid

251
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,079
metal on one side of this foil, which is

252
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,600
this target uh device. So, there's a

253
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,200
little foil of metal. We've got liquid

254
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,360
metal in this case on one side of the

255
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,839
foil and high vacuum on the other. We're

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
shooting the radiation through seeing

257
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:51,639
what happens in a certain irradiated

258
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,639
region versus unradiated. And I was uh

259
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I completely lost my train of thought.

260
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,680
Sorry.

261
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,639
Oh yes. Yes. I was saying earlier that

262
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,440
uh you can effectively speed up this

263
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,839
this process of uh of corrosion with

264
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,399
radiation but in this case it's

265
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,880
counterintuitive because what we saw was

266
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,639
in fact the corrosion was slowed down by

267
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,000
radiation. So this is a paper that was

268
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,360
published off of that um and in the

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,880
center you can see where we have

270
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,040
radiation there's actually uh less

271
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,839
corrosion that happens. Uh so we're

272
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,320
still finding these like

273
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
counterintuitive effects that you can

274
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,760
that you can observe when you try and

275
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,160
interact with this radiation stuff and

276
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,839
the corrosion stuff at the same time. Um

277
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
I have a few more slides that go over

278
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,199
kind of like the other beam lines, but I

279
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,079
think in interest of time I will simply

280
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,480
skip to the end and ask for questions

281
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,760
before uh before I head off. So we've

282
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,880
got some laser stuff. Uh if you have

283
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
questions on any of those other beam

284
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,380
lines, I'll be happy to take them now.

285
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,889
Thank you very much.

286
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,889
[Applause]

287
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,880
Any questions in here or in the Zoom

288
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,920
room? We've got about a minute at most.

289
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,920
Is the reduction in corrosion with the

290
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,160
radiation? Is there a mechanism that's

291
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,680
understood at this point or is it still

292
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,399
mystery? Uh they proposed that in the

293
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,519
paper they proposed that uh a lot of the

294
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,079
corrosion happens along grain

295
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,440
boundaries. So your corrosive material

296
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
um your material is made up of many

297
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
grains and between those grains it's

298
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
kind of like the material is not so well

299
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,839
held because it's kind of just like this

300
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,199
chaotic structure of atoms and so

301
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,079
corrosion tends to happen more

302
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,399
efficiently there and so a region around

303
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,560
that grain boundary is depleted in for

304
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
in this case chromium it was taking it

305
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,199
was leeching chromium out of the

306
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,040
material um and the idea was that what

307
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,440
what's happening with and uh process of

308
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,639
diffusion in grains is slow to the grain

309
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,399
boundary compared to the process of

310
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,440
diffusion within the grain boundary into

311
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,240
the liquid method. The idea was that

312
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,519
they proposed was um with this kind of

313
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,040
like churning effect from radiation that

314
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,079
enhanced the diffusion within the grains

315
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,959
to the grain boundaries. So it kind of

316
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,720
pumped this uh it pumped it full of the

317
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
things that it lacked in this case the

318
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
chromium and kind of allowed it to

319
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,600
survive a lot longer. Uh whereas before

320
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,600
that was just getting depleted and then

321
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,600
eroded.

322
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
Any more questions?

323
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,320
Mostly concerned about getting you out

324
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
of here in time. If not, let's thank

325
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,639
Angus again. I was about to call you

326
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,639
Sean and

327
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,600
Sean is next up. I'm not going crazy.

328
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,600
All right.

329
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,360
I can plug in. Yes.

330
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,360
On that screen.

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,679
Have a little bit of extra time because

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
one person cancelled. So, we should be

333
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,280
fine. Have to leave. He just had to

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
leave. Hey, so now we have Sean Mackey

335
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,319
who's going to be talking about studying

336
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,720
burning plasmas with fancy science.

337
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,000
Hi, I'm Sean. Uh, so I'll be telling you

338
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
a little bit about studying burning

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,640
plasmas with neutron emission

340
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,679
spectrometry. So, first of all, just a

341
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,120
little bit about, uh,

342
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,200
let me just get rid of some of the stuff

343
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,880
on my screen so you can see it.

344
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
Uh, so fusion reactions produce

345
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,360
energetic nuclear particles. Um, dutium

346
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,679
and tridium are isotopes of hydrogen

347
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,039
with extra neutrons and it's the most

348
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,720
reactive mix of fusion fuel we have. Um

349
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,559
when dutaterium and tridium react

350
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,919
together it emits an alpha particle and

351
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,600
a neutron. Uh the energy of that's

352
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
stored in the nuclear bonds within the

353
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,520
dutium and tridium is released in the

354
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,000
form of kinetic energy in these

355
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,960
products. And um you know since it's a

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
two-body kinematic reaction the amount

357
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,120
of energy that goes to the neutron and

358
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,919
the alpha particle is um a discrete

359
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,280
quantity. every time you get 14 me of

360
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,240
energy to the neutron and three and a

361
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,880
half me of energy to the alpha particle.

362
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,960
Now in a magnetic fusion situation you

363
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,880
have a strong magnetic field which

364
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,440
confine the alpha particle because it

365
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,919
has a net positive charge. Uh but the

366
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,960
neutron is uncharged and so it escapes

367
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,200
carrying with it about 80% of the um

368
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,200
energy liberated from the nuclear

369
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
reaction.

370
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,400
Right.

371
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
So the goal of any sort of fusion

372
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,360
reactor and research into fusion is to

373
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,240
get more power out than we put into the

374
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,919
plasma. Um and so the key metric that we

375
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,880
use to quantify this is called the gain

376
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,280
factor. Uh we call it Q. It's defined to

377
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,039
be equal to the ratio of the power out

378
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,200
minus the power in. So the net power

379
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,520
produced divided by the power that you

380
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,679
put into it. Um and so if you assume

381
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,000
that you're in a steady state thermal

382
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,760
equilibrium, um this reduces to the

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,440
fusion power divided by the heating

384
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,360
power. Um if Q is greater than one, that

385
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
means more energy was produced than you

386
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,080
consumed to actually heat up and produce

387
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,919
the plasma. And the point of this plot

388
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
on the right is just to show that, you

389
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,120
know, through the years, we've made a

390
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,520
lot of progress towards actually

391
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
achieving this goal. Um on this plot in

392
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,000
the top right hand corner, that's Q

393
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,480
greater than one. And you can see uh all

394
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,640
these dots and shapes represent previous

395
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,840
fusion experiments and the sort of trend

396
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,240
towards high gain uh regimes. And so now

397
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,000
after you know six decades of research

398
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,160
on the topic, we're basically right on

399
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,600
the brink of energy break even. And the

400
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,559
National Ignition Facility, if you saw

401
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,720
Maria's talk on Monday, um they've

402
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,240
actually already achieved this. And so

403
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,799
we know that it's possible to get more

404
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,559
energy out than in um from these types

405
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,640
of uh reactors. So we just need to make

406
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,200
it sort of commercially relevant or

407
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,200
economically relevant.

408
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,559
And so okay, if our goal is to make Q

409
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,160
greater than one, how do we actually

410
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
know if we've achieved that goal? We

411
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,960
need to somehow measure the energy or

412
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,039
the power gain of the reactor. And so

413
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,720
the denominator of that expression, the

414
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,919
input power, that's pretty easy to

415
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,360
measure. You could just call up the

416
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,600
electrical company and say, "Hey, how

417
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,280
much uh power did I use to heat up my

418
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,200
plasma?" And they'll say, "Oh, you know,

419
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,120
you used a megawatt or whatever." The

420
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,120
output power is a little more tricky. Um

421
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,559
and so the most reliable method that we

422
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,159
have to actually measure how much fusion

423
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,960
is going on, the power liberated from

424
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,280
fusion is to count neutrons. Since each

425
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
dutium tridium fusion reaction makes one

426
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,600
neutron, uh the fusion power will be

427
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
proportional to the neutron emission

428
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
rate. And so if you can count your

429
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,600
neutrons, you can infer what the fusion

430
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
power was. My research is all about

431
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,840
developing advanced neutron detection

432
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,159
methods for the spark tok. You may be

433
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,960
asking, well, what the heck is spark? If

434
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,720
you missed Alex's lovely talk on Monday,

435
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,880
um Spark is a demonstration device um

436
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,120
designed to generate net magnetic fusion

437
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,799
energy. Um it's being built by a PSFC

438
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,320
spinout company called Commonwolf Fusion

439
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,280
Systems. They're building this reactor

440
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,320
out in Devons. Um on the right I have a

441
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,120
picture of the Spark facility and then

442
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,600
in the pink box is the interior of the

443
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,600
Tokome Hall. Um you can see a picture of

444
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,760
what Spark will look like printed on the

445
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,760
back wall of that room. And then on the

446
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,080
left wall uh you can see the neutron

447
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,080
camera slit which is that all vertical

448
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,320
slit and a number of other diagnostic

449
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,880
access holes through the primary shield

450
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,720
wall. Um so spark is designed using high

451
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,120
temperature superconductors uh which

452
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,720
like Angus mentioned is like sort of the

453
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,520
key break technological breakthrough

454
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,240
that's enabling um fusion to really sort

455
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,600
of take the next step. Uh these magnets

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,919
are more powerful than previous

457
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,440
generations of magnets and they confine

458
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,880
the plasma a lot more strongly. So

459
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,000
you're able to achieve higher temp

460
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,919
temperatures and densities um without

461
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,600
you know sort of having to put in a lot

462
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,159
more power to maintain those uh

463
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,640
densities and temperatures. And one of

464
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,400
the key parts of Spark's mission of

465
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,919
proving that, you know, net energy is

466
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,919
possible with magnetic fusion is having

467
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,760
a really robust set of neutron

468
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,080
diagnostics and neutron measurement

469
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
techniques.

470
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,440
In addition to just telling you about

471
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,120
how much fusion is going on, neutrons

472
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,720
also carry a lot of information about

473
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,320
the plasma. Um so if you can make a

474
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,559
nicely resolved measurement of the

475
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,640
neutron energy spectrum you can also

476
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,440
diagnose plasma par parameters such as

477
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,080
the fuel ion temperature the bulk plasma

478
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,919
density the ratio of fuel ions so

479
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,440
dutaterium to tridium uh if it's not

480
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,760
50/50

481
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,919
um and also sort of more subtle effects

482
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,720
like the heating power coupling or you

483
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,720
know more sort of uh subtle things

484
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,280
beyond that as well and on the right

485
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
here I just have a plot showing how the

486
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,400
thermonucle Lear neutron spectrum

487
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,000
changes as a function of fuel

488
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,400
temperature. So in blue you can see

489
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,080
relatively low temperature plasma four

490
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,480
kevs the units that we use. Um it's sort

491
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
of low amplitude and skinny and as you

492
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,080
increase the temperature the amplitude

493
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,480
goes up there's more fusion going on but

494
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
also the distribution gets wider because

495
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,039
um the thermal broadening of the neutron

496
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
emissions uh gets increases with

497
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,320
temperature and that broadening actually

498
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
increases as the square root of

499
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,640
temperature. So if you can measure your

500
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,559
neutron spectrum and measure how broad

501
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
it is, you have a measure of the ion

502
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,120
temperature, which is really useful uh

503
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,320
for assessing how well your plasma is

504
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,080
actually heating up and things like

505
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,679
that.

506
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,240
Um so okay, this thing goes to 11. Spark

507
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,400
is designed to reach Q of 11. So while Q

508
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,159
greater than one is a big milestone to

509
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
be economically viable, you really need

510
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,919
Q to be much larger than one because you

511
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,080
need to take into account all the

512
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,120
inefficiency of efficiencies of the

513
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,679
plant. And so if we really are reaching

514
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,280
Q of 11, that would be really great

515
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,360
because it would demonstrate that okay,

516
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,080
this reactor concept, it's actually

517
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,240
scalable to economically viable levels.

518
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,799
Um, but from a scientific perspective,

519
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,240
once we hit Q of five, the majority of

520
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
the plasma's heating is actually coming

521
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,360
from the fusion reactions itself. And so

522
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,039
this state where most of the heating is

523
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,600
coming from the fusion itself is called

524
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,360
the burning plasma state. Um, and it's a

525
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,880
new regime of plasma physics that hasn't

526
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,480
been studied experimentally. And so

527
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,320
that's what I'm really excited to work

528
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,000
on. And so you can probe a lot of the

529
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,840
interesting novel physics of the burning

530
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
plasma regime using neutron

531
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,840
spectrometry. Um, and so there's a

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
couple of ways to see this. Like first

533
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,320
of all, the neutron spectrum is in a

534
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,159
sense the twin of the alpha birth uh

535
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,600
alpha particle birth spectrum because

536
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,919
they're both being born from the same

537
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,760
reactions. The spectrum of neutrons is

538
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
intimately related to the spectrum of

539
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,960
alphas before they have a chance to slow

540
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,559
down in the plasma. So that's an

541
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,039
important input to modeling what's going

542
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,480
on in the plasma. Also, nuclear

543
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,039
scattering becomes really important at

544
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,880
these high uh gain regimes and that

545
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,720
manifests itself in the neutron spectrum

546
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,320
as a high energy tail. And so if you can

547
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
measure that high energy neutron

548
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,159
spectrum, you know something about how

549
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,840
the fusion products are actually slowing

550
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
down and heating the plasma. And so

551
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,559
that's a useful input as well. And so

552
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,039
I've spent a lot of my uh time here at

553
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,440
MIT developing what's called the a

554
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,720
magnetic proton recoil spectrometer. And

555
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,400
so that's what I'm showing on the bottom

556
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,880
right here is a schematic of that

557
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,720
diagnostic. Um it's basically a giant

558
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,480
proton beam line. And you generate the

559
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,559
protons by having neutrons scatter them

560
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,159
out of a plastic foil. They go through a

561
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,400
big magnet system and get sorted and

562
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,080
focused based on their energy and you

563
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,360
detect them in a detector array. And so

564
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,320
you have this position resolved

565
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,320
measurement of the protons which is uh

566
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,799
in turn related to the energy spectrum

567
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,720
of the neutrons.

568
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,440
Um

569
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,039
yeah so in summary um neutron

570
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,200
measurements are critical to validating

571
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,880
fusion reactor performance. The neutron

572
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,559
energy spectrum encodes a lot of useful

573
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,320
diagnostic information about the plasma

574
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,320
including the ion temperature, the fuel

575
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,799
composition and uh information about the

576
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,360
heating and the burning plasma regime is

577
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,120
an unexplored scientific territory and

578
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,880
neutron spectrometry gives us a way to

579
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,279
empirically map the terrain of this new

580
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,039
regime. And then you know this is just a

581
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,120
picture of me and the rest of the

582
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,039
neutron diagnostics team for Spark

583
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
standing in front of the neutron camera

584
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,559
slit which is where we're going to put a

585
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,840
lot of our diagnostics.

586
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,840
Happy to take any questions.

587
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,080
We have time for a question or two if we

588
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,400
have any.

589
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,799
So I was wondering about the so you

590
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,640
mentioned about the the efficiency as uh

591
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,559
comparing the amount of power you put in

592
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,000
with the power which is stored inside

593
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,440
and I'm wondering about the physics of

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,720
how this power is going to be converted

595
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,600
in a useful way into let's say

596
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,080
electricity and so on. Few words. So, in

597
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,440
a real fusion reactor, um, you're not

598
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,039
just looking at these neutrons as a

599
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,640
diagnostic tool, but they're since

600
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,720
they're carrying out 80% of the energy

601
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,559
from the nuclear reactions. If you could

602
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,320
thermalize those neutrons, you could

603
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,240
drive a thermal cycle. And so, the

604
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,480
leading idea is that you would have some

605
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,159
sort of neutron moderator to catch all

606
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,919
these energetic neutrons, slow them

607
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,520
down, and heat up that moderator, and

608
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,200
then you can boil water with it and turn

609
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,360
a turbine. Thank you.

610
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,600
Any other questions that we're squeezing

611
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,120
in?

612
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,919
If not, let's give Sean a hand again and

613
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,440
Abby.

614
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
When Abby gets up here, I will tell you

615
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,080
what she's talking about.

616
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,240
I should have asked for titles before.

617
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,240
You're a USB.

618
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,600
Just get rid of this.

619
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,919
All right. So, Aby's going to be talking

620
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
to us about exploring runaway electron

621
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,640
impacts in Spark, which we just learned

622
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,159
about. All right. Hi. My name is Abby.

623
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm a grad student here, and I'm going

624
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,039
to be talking just like Lauren just

625
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
said, I'm going to be talking about

626
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,039
exploring runaway electron impacts in

627
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,320
Spark. And I'll define what those are in

628
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,320
just a minute. So,

629
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,039
um, like everyone else has been talking

630
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960
about, I'm also still talking about

631
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,960
tokamax. And one way that I like to

632
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,640
think about tokamax is that tokamax are

633
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,320
kind of like trying to contain jello-

634
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,279
with rubber bands. So, what we're doing

635
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,559
here is we're containing a plasma with

636
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,399
magnetic fields. And so, you've got

637
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,120
magnetic fields that wind around the

638
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,440
tokamac in both the tooidal direction

639
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,679
and the poloidal direction. And these

640
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,880
contain your plasma. And these tokam the

641
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,440
reason that we're all talking about

642
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,840
tokamax is because tokamax have been the

643
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,840
best at confining plasmas so far. They

644
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,159
very have very better confinement than

645
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,600
any other fusion device that we've been

646
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,600
able to build so far. However, they are

647
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,960
quite unstable just like if you had

648
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,760
jello- in the middle of a bunch of

649
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,760
rubber bands. And so if something

650
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,840
happens, if it goes slightly off, you

651
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,840
can have sudden losses of your plasma.

652
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,039
So you can have your plasma suddenly be

653
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,880
lost from the device, hit the wall, and

654
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,840
it can lose a lot of its energy very

655
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,000
fast. So this is known as disruption,

656
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,760
and these are bad for business. If

657
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,679
you're trying to make uh fusion energy

658
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,279
and make money off of that, it's very

659
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,720
bad if you lose your plasma because you

660
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,960
lose your fusion and you're no longer

661
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,960
producing energy.

662
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,880
Um, and one other thing that can happen

663
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,520
during disruptions is you can get beams

664
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,679
of relativistic electrons. So in a

665
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,159
tokamac when it's operating in its nice

666
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,720
steady state it contains mega amps of

667
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,640
plasma current which is a lot of current

668
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,120
and so when your plasma gets unstable

669
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,640
you can transfer this current into uh

670
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,240
these relativistic electrons um and

671
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,159
these are known as runaway electrons

672
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,080
because they're in essence running away

673
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,600
and so you've got this beam of electrons

674
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,520
spinning around and around and around in

675
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
your tokamac and then it has to go

676
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,080
somewhere and if you're hearing this and

677
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,760
you're thinking oh a beam of very high

678
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,919
energy electrons. That sounds like sort

679
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,279
of familiar to me. Um, you would be

680
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,880
correct because this is the same thing

681
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,960
as lightning. So, you can think of a

682
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,960
beam of runaway electrons as sort of a

683
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,960
beam of lightning in your tokamac that's

684
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,240
going around and around and around until

685
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,159
it has to go somewhere. So, when this

686
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,159
beam of relativistic electrons goes

687
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,240
somewhere, you can get damage. So, what

688
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,159
I've got here is I've got a video from

689
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,200
the Alcatore CMO tokamac, which was a

690
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,480
tokamac that was here on campus at MIT.

691
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,520
And you can see in this video, it's

692
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,799
pretty boring. The plasma is

693
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,480
transparent. So nothing is really

694
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,480
happening and then it starts to get a

695
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,399
little crazy and then boom, you've got a

696
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,960
beam of runaway electrons which hits the

697
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,720
wall and causes sparks. So it's melting

698
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,080
the wall because it went unstable and it

699
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,039
hit the wall and then you got some

700
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,600
melting, some sparks. Very exciting but

701
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,039
also very bad.

702
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,640
And this is not unique to Alcatore Sean.

703
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,799
We've seen this across several

704
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,600
experiments across the world. So we've

705
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,120
seen wall melting, metal vaporization,

706
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,880
and even a magnet quench. And if you

707
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,880
punch your magnets, your tomax stops

708
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
working. Um, so we've seen this across

709
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,640
several experiments. And here I've got

710
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,399
just sort of a fun collage of damage

711
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,000
that's been caused by runaway electrons.

712
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,159
So the CMOD damage up in the top right

713
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,520
corner. And then also Jet, which is a

714
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,360
tokamac um over in the UK. Texor and

715
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,200
West are two other examples of tokamax

716
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,399
that have had runaway electron beams hit

717
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,440
something and cause some melting. So

718
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,480
this can be bad for tokamax that we've

719
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,000
seen in the past. But the question is

720
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,600
what does this look like for power

721
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,520
plant-l like devices? So when we go to

722
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,080
the future and we're try to actually

723
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,000
make power and then make money from our

724
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,000
tokamax, how does this scale to that? Um

725
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,679
and the answer uh and before I talk

726
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,679
about what the answer to that is, I want

727
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,279
to just talk about Spark really quick.

728
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,600
Um Sean already did a great job of

729
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,600
introducing it. So spark will be the

730
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,760
first tokamac to achieve Q greater than

731
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,200
one. So more fusion power power power

732
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
than the power you're putting into your

733
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,919
tokamac. But what this means for spark

734
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,159
in comparison to other tokamacs that

735
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,320
have previously been run is that spark

736
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,080
will have a higher magnetic field, a

737
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,880
higher plasma current, higher

738
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,880
temperatures, which means lots of stored

739
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,880
energy in your plasma. And so for the

740
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,120
disruptions, this means lots of energy

741
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,480
that then has to leave or lots of energy

742
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,799
that can be transferred to runaway

743
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,399
electrons. So if we look at this more

744
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,399
quantitatively

745
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,880
um we can see that this damage could be

746
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,039
worse in spark because spark has so much

747
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,360
stored energy. So the damage that a

748
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,679
runaway electron beam can cause is

749
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,919
largely related to both the energy of

750
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,720
the beam. If you have a very high energy

751
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,640
beam, you can melt a lot of material. Um

752
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,399
but it also depends on how large of an

753
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,880
area that that beam strikes. So if you

754
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,240
hit a very small area, you deposit a lot

755
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,919
of energy into that area and you're

756
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,080
going to really melt a good section of

757
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,399
that. However, you you spread out that

758
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,000
energy over a wider area, maybe you

759
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,480
won't hit a melt threshold, and maybe

760
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,240
you'll just cause the area to heat up,

761
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,840
but it won't quite hit melting. So, this

762
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,840
uh

763
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,440
there is a threshold for which melting

764
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,000
occurs, and that threshold is around 3

765
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,360
to 5 mega per meter squared um for

766
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,679
tungsten, which is going to be the first

767
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,519
wall material in spark. And the energy

768
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,679
that a runaway electron beam has is

769
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,279
proportional to the current squared. And

770
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,120
so this is why when we look forward to

771
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,159
spark which will have a plasma current

772
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,000
of 8.7 megga this starts to get quite

773
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,159
concerning because spark will have the

774
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,320
highest plasma current of any device so

775
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,799
far. Um that means that we could see

776
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,880
really high energy u runaway electron

777
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,880
beams up to tens of megajles which is

778
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,120
very very powerful. And so what I've

779
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,960
done here is I've scoped um what

780
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,880
potential runaway electron impacts could

781
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,440
look like. So I've got um I've scoped

782
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,440
from zero to 8.7 mega of runaway

783
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,360
electron current. And I've also scoped

784
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,039
what the average energy could look like.

785
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,200
And then on the graph, I've put the

786
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,559
wetted area for which the beam exceeds

787
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,279
that melt threshold. So if you look at

788
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,519
this simulated spark case um which was

789
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,320
simulated with a code called dream that

790
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,159
runs um that has about five megaamps of

791
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,799
current and an average energy of about

792
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,200
eight uh me. And you can see that this

793
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,440
lies on the 10 meters squared contour.

794
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,320
So that means that this simulated case

795
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,480
could melt 10 m squared of wall area

796
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,159
which is a very large section of wall.

797
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,919
So we got to hope that that does not

798
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,320
happen because that would be quite bad

799
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,320
for Spark operations.

800
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,240
So what are we going to do about this is

801
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,800
the question.

802
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,200
Spark will have some mitigation

803
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,960
techniques to mitigate runaway electron

804
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,639
beams and mitigate damage. So one thing

805
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,480
is massive gas injection. So if you um

806
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,800
inject some massive gas into your

807
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,879
plasma, your plasma radiates away its

808
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,879
energy. And this means that the energy

809
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,639
of your plasma gets more uniformly um

810
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,320
radiated into the walls rather than a

811
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,000
runaway electron beam which can hit a

812
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,159
very small area and deposit a lot of

813
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,320
energy onto a smaller area. So the goal

814
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,320
is to spread out where the energy goes

815
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,240
onto your walls. The other thing that

816
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,920
will happen uh that Spark will have is a

817
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,160
runaway electron mitigation coil, which

818
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,079
is this image that I put here. Um, and

819
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,160
so what this does is it sort of has a

820
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,839
funky shape. And when you have a

821
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,200
disruption with a runaway electron beam,

822
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,680
what the runaway electron mitigation

823
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,359
coil does is it introduces perturbations

824
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,280
to your magnetic field. It messes with

825
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,200
your nice ordered magnetic field, making

826
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,880
it a bit chaotic. And so this means that

827
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,720
your runaway electrons are just

828
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,520
deconfined. So they just exit before

829
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,599
they have the chance to uh cause a very

830
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,040
large coherent beam of runaway electrons

831
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,760
that can then cause damage. Um and so we

832
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,000
have some mitigation techniques but what

833
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,079
what else we are doing is modeling. So

834
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,240
that's where I come in. Um so the goal

835
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,240
is of my modeling is to determine how

836
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,560
bad different runaway electron scenarios

837
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,920
will be and then to determine how we can

838
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,760
avoid those scenarios with our

839
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,320
mitigation techniques. If we know how

840
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,160
bad certain things we can be uh we can

841
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,119
avoid that and we can make sure that our

842
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,920
machine is okay and operates in a safe

843
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,040
um in a safe sense.

844
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,520
So to conclude, tokamax can get

845
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,599
lightning like beams of electrons in

846
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,119
during disruptions and these electrons

847
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,280
can damage the walls which you can see

848
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,880
over here in this collage again and this

849
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,880
damage might get worse in future

850
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,200
devices. So we need to understand this

851
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,960
damage so we can mitigate it better. So

852
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,180
hopefully Sprite will not look like

853
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,440
this. So thank you.

854
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,760
[Applause]

855
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,119
Uh questions from the audience and if

856
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,240
not we'll take the one from the chat.

857
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,320
First, do any of you have a question?

858
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,079
You mentioned gas injection as a way to

859
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,560
mitigate runaway electrons, but that

860
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,720
seems to run counterintuitive to uh the

861
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,640
whole standard of fusion where you want

862
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,800
to try to have as much fusion power as

863
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,560
you can in the core. Um, is there like a

864
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,200
trade-off here? And how big is the

865
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,599
trade-off? So the massive gas injection

866
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,240
is a thing that you do when you're

867
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,079
already operating when basically when

868
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,160
you're already operating in a space that

869
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,920
is going towards a disruption, you do

870
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,480
the massive gas induction to mitigate

871
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,839
the effects of the disruption. So you

872
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,240
wouldn't want to have a nicely

873
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,920
performing plasma that then you then uh

874
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,480
put a lot of massive gas into because

875
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,839
then you just radiate away your power.

876
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,599
Um, so it's when your plasma is

877
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,079
performing badly, that's when you throw

878
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,839
in the massive gas to get it to get rid

879
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,839
of its energy in the safest way it can.

880
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,720
Any other questions from in the room?

881
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,800
We have a question here which is asking

882
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,760
the re beams are expressed using energy

883
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,280
terms versus using power terms. Is this

884
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,560
is this because the damage is better

885
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,400
thought of as an impact like an

886
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,720
instantaneous projectile versus energy

887
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,200
deposited over time? Yeah, this is a

888
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,200
this is a really good question. So the

889
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,040
time scale of runaway electron impacts

890
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,440
tends to be quite small. I think on the

891
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,520
order of milliseconds to sometimes even

892
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,280
can be even shorter than that. And so

893
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,839
that's why we think of it in terms of

894
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,119
energy rather than power because it's

895
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,880
basically you can kind of think of it

896
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,520
like an instantaneous thing when the

897
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,200
beam hits the wall.

898
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,480
All right. Well, maybe for the sake of

899
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,550
time we'll move on to the next speaker,

900
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,640
but let's thank Abby again.

901
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,920
[Applause]

902
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,400
We'll take about 30 seconds to

903
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,400
transition as we do

904
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
here.

905
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Try

906
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,200
it. Take it. Link is also

907
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,480
Can you I didn't see it. No, you're

908
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,839
fine. Super cool.

909
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,320
Like just like Did you join the Zoom

910
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,880
room? Uh, I should be in the zoom room.

911
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,880
Make sure for later.

912
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,040
Joseph is going to be talking to us in a

913
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,599
second about superconducting diodes for

914
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,760
quantum computing. And we are just

915
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,440
getting this. You got that working.

916
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,280
So,

917
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,480
hello. So, uh, I'm Joseph. I'm going to

918
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,400
be talking about a slightly different

919
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,480
topic actually from plasmas and so on.

920
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,480
Very high energy physics. I just saw an

921
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,520
axis with mega. I'm going to be talking

922
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,680
about milliamps. So, uh the idea is that

923
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,359
we work with superconductors that are

924
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,599
very useful materials as you're going to

925
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,440
see especially at very low temperatures.

926
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,119
So, let me just uh get started and

927
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,720
motivate why we are doing what we are

928
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,720
doing. So you know that there is

929
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,960
recently this uh this very large

930
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,520
evolution in in quantum computers which

931
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,920
are working at at low temperatures and

932
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,920
you look at the at some of the latest

933
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,839
nowadays I think they already by 100 or

934
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,000
200 but you look at those quantum

935
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,520
computers which have like 50 cubits and

936
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,240
then they have a lot of cables around

937
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,280
and so on. You compare this with uh with

938
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,520
our usual uh desktop computers and you

939
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,640
see that uh there are almost no cables

940
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,720
laying around. everything is actually

941
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,359
integrated into circuits and so on. And

942
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,880
that happens because uh these quantum

943
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,560
computers they need to operate at very

944
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,320
small temperatures and it's actually

945
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,079
hard to have uh the logic that we are

946
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,680
used to operate at room temperature at

947
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,920
such low temperatures because it's very

948
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,520
difficult to cool down at down to those

949
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,480
very low temperatures. You can have

950
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,320
mills of cooling power at at those

951
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,160
temperatures. So you have to be very

952
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,119
economical with how you spend energy

953
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,119
there. Now, there are some computing

954
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,520
approaches which are actually able to do

955
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,040
these operations at 4.2 Kelvin, but

956
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,720
those actually need some DC power

957
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,560
delivery, which in practice implies that

958
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,560
you need to have tons of cables going

959
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,280
down and that's why you see all this uh

960
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,240
stuff. Our goal is to find a way to to

961
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,560
do this uh uh AC to DC conversion at at

962
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,320
these low temperatures so that all these

963
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,160
cables can be removed or just very

964
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,640
heavily reduced so that scaling can go

965
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,480
farther. That is how we want to do it.

966
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,160
And of course what we want to do there

967
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,520
is to to do that with what we call

968
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
superconducting diodes which are a

969
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,000
variant of semiconducting diode just as

970
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,400
a reminder. So semiconducting diode is a

971
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,599
is a system which is semiconductor

972
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,200
actually as the name says which uh has a

973
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,560
very asymmetric response to an applied

974
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,920
voltage. So when you apply a voltage

975
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,440
between its terminals if it's in the

976
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,359
forward direction you can get very high

977
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,119
current in the reverse direction you get

978
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,640
a very small current. That means that

979
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,359
the resistance in this direction is very

980
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,720
high and this res direction is very low.

981
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,079
Now this is very useful because it

982
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,560
allows for conversion of AC currents

983
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,720
into DC. But do you see also that there

984
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,800
this is a resistive system that means

985
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,160
yeah the slides are not changing on

986
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,480
Zoom. Oh really? Thank you for letting

987
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,480
me know.

988
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,119
Now it's Is it now working? Let's try.

989
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,319
Is it changing or something? Yeah, we're

990
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,640
seeing the speaker view. Um ah

991
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,290
Okay.

992
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,400
Sorry.

993
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:06,440
[Music]

994
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,440
Speaker view. Where was that?

995
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,800
Amazing. Now it should work.

996
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,760
Is it now working? Thank you so much for

997
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,240
letting me know. Sorry for that. So,

998
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,200
so coming from the uh from the

999
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,640
semiconduity

1000
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,000
of the response. So you have this very

1001
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,560
large asymmetry between positive and

1002
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,880
negative voltage which allows for

1003
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,640
converting AC currents into DC. But the

1004
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,560
prime is a resistive so it dissipates

1005
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,760
heat. So we need to look for an

1006
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,040
alternative that can work at low

1007
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,760
temperatures and that is what we call a

1008
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,280
superconducting diode. As some of you

1009
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
know superconductors are materials that

1010
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,720
can can carry current without the

1011
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,040
resistance. That means that you do not

1012
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,800
have heat dissipations in that regime.

1013
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,240
But you know everything has a limit and

1014
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,000
superconductors have a limit which is

1015
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
called critical current and that is how

1016
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,400
much current they can carry without heat

1017
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,920
dissipation. Now if we make that

1018
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,359
critical current to be direction

1019
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,599
dependent meaning that for positive uh

1020
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,800
critical current when you apply a

1021
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,280
positive current you need a lot of

1022
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,800
current to to drive the system resistive

1023
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,800
and when you apply a negative current

1024
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,160
you need much less current. What is

1025
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,079
going to happen is that you also have

1026
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,359
this kind of non-reciprocal response

1027
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,520
which is very asymmetric between

1028
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,000
positive and negative voltage and now

1029
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,760
that uh that may allow also for the AC

1030
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,960
to DC power conversion at at low

1031
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,560
temperatures but then you'd have a lot

1032
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,640
of less power dissipation because in

1033
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,160
this whole regime you're not dissipating

1034
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,839
heat

1035
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,079
and our goal is to actually make use of

1036
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,359
these systems. However, first let me

1037
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,200
just briefly explain you how we make

1038
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,480
these superconducting diodes. What we do

1039
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,240
is we actually make use of what is

1040
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,760
called the masoner effect which is this

1041
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,599
property of superconductors that they

1042
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,800
repel magnetic fields. The idea is that

1043
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,880
you apply a magnetic field to a

1044
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,200
superconductor and it's going to repel

1045
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,640
it by uh creating what is called a

1046
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,560
masoner current inside. So here you have

1047
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,560
a circulating current that is going to

1048
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,160
oppose the flow of this magnetic field

1049
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,319
inside. Now if we make a device which is

1050
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,839
just an ultra thin stripe of a

1051
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,680
superconductor, we apply a magnetic

1052
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,280
field perpendicular to the plane. That

1053
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,200
means that at the opposite edges we're

1054
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,920
going to have opposite mason currents as

1055
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,680
you can see here. Now since our s this

1056
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,040
just the top view of the sample when you

1057
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,920
apply a positive current meaning that

1058
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,520
it's going up as this purple arrow shows

1059
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,119
we have that at this edge we're having a

1060
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,720
very high current but at this other edge

1061
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,960
we're having much smaller current. If we

1062
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,079
reverse the current direction then what

1063
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,000
happens is that this edge is the one

1064
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,440
that has more current. Now we are using

1065
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,280
a type of superconductors which are

1066
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,400
called type two where the edges are

1067
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,160
actually the ones which limit the

1068
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,680
critical current. And that actually

1069
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,920
means that because we have made these

1070
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,160
notches here. We have reduced the

1071
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,520
critical current of this edge. And now

1072
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,119
by controlling the direction of the

1073
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,400
current, we can have a low critical

1074
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,760
current in this direction and a high

1075
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,680
critical current in this other

1076
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,280
direction. However, this technique

1077
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,280
requires a magnetic field to be applied

1078
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,119
on the sample and we want to get rid of

1079
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,160
that. So what we do is the following. We

1080
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,640
just place a ferroagnet

1081
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,680
uh on top of the superconductor and now

1082
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,440
we have the stray field from the

1083
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,920
ferroagnet which have opposite sign in

1084
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,520
both edges but they actually result in

1085
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,920
having a minor current that has the same

1086
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,359
sign of both edges because the very edge

1087
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,359
is what limits the critical current.

1088
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,040
This allows you to have a diode even at

1089
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,319
zero magnetic field that is useful

1090
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,000
because it will not disturb other

1091
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,200
superconducting components working next

1092
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,280
to it. Now comes the part of converting

1093
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,960
AC currents into DC. I mean we have all

1094
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,079
gone to high school and we have all seen

1095
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,920
what a diode bridge is. So the question

1096
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,599
is how would that work when instead of

1097
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,599
having semiconducting in diodes we

1098
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,800
actually have superconducting diodes.

1099
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,400
Now the rules of the game with

1100
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,920
superconducting diode as I told you is

1101
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
that the resistance is zero when the

1102
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,839
applied current is very small. But then

1103
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,680
if the applied current is either higher

1104
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:42,319
positive than the than the critical

1105
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,119
current in forward direction or lower in

1106
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,040
negative than the applied current in

1107
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,400
than the critical current in the reverse

1108
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,359
direction then it's going to turn

1109
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,640
resistive. Now what uh we can see just

1110
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,800
simply what is going to happen to this

1111
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,319
circuit. uh here the moment we apply a

1112
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
positive current you can see here that

1113
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,200
half of the half of the diodes will

1114
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,800
become resistive and it's going to be

1115
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,280
the ones where the current is opposing

1116
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,520
the the arrow as defined here and what

1117
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,599
you see now is that you apply a positive

1118
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,720
voltage here and you eventually you get

1119
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,040
a positive voltage here now the moment

1120
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,599
that we reverse the the applied current

1121
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,880
again this is uh this is uh reversing

1122
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,800
the diodes which become resistive

1123
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,280
because it's the ones which are opposing

1124
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,880
and so you end up having again a

1125
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,240
positive voltage on this side and this

1126
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,400
This is how the full wave

1127
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,319
superconducting uh diode rectifier

1128
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,640
works. Now let me just show you a little

1129
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,079
bit on how we our results look like. So

1130
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,520
we made the superconducting diodes

1131
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,079
following these techniques that I told

1132
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,319
you and then we just applied some AC

1133
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,720
currents as an input and then you see

1134
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,359
how the output shows this full wave

1135
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,359
rectifier operation and then of course

1136
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,200
we apply a magnetic field which is

1137
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,119
reversing our diodes and we can just

1138
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,040
have a programmable rectifier in a

1139
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,640
sense. you don't you're not fixed by the

1140
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,720
device design but you can use magnetic

1141
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,680
fields to tune it so you can reverse the

1142
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,560
diodes you can get opposite uh signals

1143
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,640
and then finally we just replace the the

1144
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,839
resistor with a smoothing capacitor and

1145
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,680
now you have AC2DC conversion as uh

1146
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,880
people do conventionally at room

1147
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,160
temperature but now we have done this

1148
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,160
one at 1.8 8 Kelvin and that that is the

1149
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,640
goal that we had here. So sorry it's 1.7

1150
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,480
Kelvin to be precise. And with that I

1151
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,920
hope I have convinced you that by by

1152
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,359
exploiting masonary currents you can

1153
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,200
create what is called superconducting

1154
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,079
diodes which are these non-reciprocal

1155
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,520
superconductors that are useful to for

1156
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,520
instance make full wave rectifiers

1157
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,200
working at low temperatures that are

1158
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,599
capable of converting AC currents into

1159
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,079
DC and that this is actually useful for

1160
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,319
superconducting quantum computing and

1161
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,800
with that I thank the the collaborators

1162
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:44,319
and you all for your attention.

1163
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,839
[Applause]

1164
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,280
We're a little behind but we can take

1165
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,520
one question if there is a question.

1166
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,560
Um so you mentioned that this uses type

1167
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,319
2 superconductors. Do you think that you

1168
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,760
know with all the excitement around high

1169
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,240
temperature superconductors that does

1170
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,599
that also have uh applications for you

1171
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:08,000
know power electronics for quantum

1172
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:09,760
computers? It it could but so it's um so

1173
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,839
I mean it needs to be type two to work

1174
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,079
with this with this method but any type

1175
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,920
two will work. Yes. Okay. But in high

1176
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,760
TTC usually they they tend to be type

1177
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,599
two right.

1178
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,960
Yeah. It's usually a matter of of the

1179
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,040
condition at which you need it to

1180
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,280
operate. The the main thing here maybe

1181
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,200
is that you don't want to operate at 77

1182
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,800
Kelvin because typically wirings and

1183
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,040
everything that connects down these are

1184
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,359
resistive wirings but usually below 4.2

1185
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,559
2 Kelvin people use nobium and so on. So

1186
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,839
you can have superc conducting

1187
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,640
interconnects between the different

1188
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,240
levels. So if you may use a high TC

1189
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,960
superconductor

1190
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,160
but um but you you eventually want to

1191
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,960
use it either at 4.2 Kelvin or below. So

1192
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,640
the benefit will not be so much unless

1193
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:55,880
you want very high critical current for

1194
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,880
specific high power application. I see.

1195
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:04,820
Let's thank Joseph again. Um,

1196
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,820
[Applause]

1197
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,319
oh yeah, I think

1198
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,359
right here.

1199
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,359
Perfect.

1200
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,480
I've got it.

1201
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,559
people on the Zoom this

1202
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,680
up. Xander is going to be talking to us

1203
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,559
about disruption prediction with

1204
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,559
scientific machine learning.

1205
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,040
All right.

1206
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,040
So,

1207
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,200
so for the last 60 years, Tokamax have

1208
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,680
dominated magnetic confinement fusion

1209
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:47,000
research. So, this is because tokamax

1210
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,000
have excellent particle confinement and

1211
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,280
there we go. excellent particle

1212
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,040
confinement and have demonstrated a 100

1213
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,680
times better performance than other

1214
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,359
magnetic confinement fusion designs.

1215
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,200
Further, their simple donut-shaped

1216
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:01,200
geometry make them relatively easy to

1217
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,200
build. As such, there have been dozens

1218
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,040
of Tokamax constructed around the world,

1219
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,359
and the research community has decades

1220
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,200
of experience operating them. Given the

1221
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,200
successful experimental history, many

1222
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,160
think tokamax are the natural choice for

1223
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,559
building a fusion pilot plant. However,

1224
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,680
tokamax have a little bit of a problem

1225
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,599
uh in that they are prone to

1226
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,839
instabilities and these instabilities

1227
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,160
can lead to disruption as Abby was

1228
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,559
mentioning earlier. Uh yeah, so

1229
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,960
disruptions are kind of a problem. Now

1230
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,520
when I say that the nuclear fusion power

1231
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,440
plant uh can experience a sudden loss of

1232
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,520
confinement uh you might picture

1233
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,160
something like this.

1234
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,680
Fortunately, that can't happen. And this

1235
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,319
is one of the few parts of the fusion

1236
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,240
propaganda which is actually true. So

1237
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,960
tokamac disruptions actually look like

1238
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,800
this. So there's zero risk of a runaway

1239
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,040
chain reaction leading to a Chernobyl

1240
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,440
style accident because if anything goes

1241
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,680
wrong, the plasma rapidly expands and

1242
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,440
cools and the reactions stop. So one

1243
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,000
instant your plasma is there and the

1244
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,000
next it is gone.

1245
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,319
Now while disruptions pose zero risk to

1246
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,720
anyone outside the tokamac, they are

1247
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,200
still a concern for the device itself.

1248
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,680
So future tokamax like spark will have

1249
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,319
hundreds of megaj of stored thermal

1250
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,480
energy and megaamps of plasma current.

1251
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,240
So when confinement is lost all this

1252
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,000
energy and current have to leave the

1253
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,680
plasma and they it goes into the

1254
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,800
surrounding structural materials

1255
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,839
extremely fast um causing large heat

1256
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,839
flux and halo current forces. Uh to put

1257
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,520
these numbers in perspective, the heat

1258
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:35,920
shield of an Apollo capsule during

1259
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:38,720
re-entry experiences a peak heat flux of

1260
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,680
only 1 gawatt per meter squared and a

1261
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:45,599
Saturn 5 rocket first stage has 35

1262
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,839
megatons of thrust. So we want to avoid

1263
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,040
disruptions in spark because they pose

1264
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:54,880
significant materials challenges.

1265
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:57,040
Um so preventing disruptions means you

1266
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,280
need to avoid instabilities. So you want

1267
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,839
some dynamics model so you can predict

1268
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,559
how the plasma will evolve in the

1269
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,720
future. As I said before, tokamax have

1270
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,720
existed for over 60 years at this point.

1271
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,559
We must have comprehensive methods of

1272
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,480
determining exactly how plasmas will

1273
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,760
behave in a variety of circumstances,

1274
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,599
right? Well, yes and no. There are some

1275
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,079
models that have proven to be extremely

1276
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,599
valuable, such as ideal MHD, but there

1277
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,440
are others that continue to present

1278
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:26,480
challenges. These are things like

1279
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,440
turbulence, um, plasma material

1280
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,280
interaction, magnetic reconnection, etc.

1281
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,440
In addition, any solution that you

1282
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,079
develop must be compatible with real

1283
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,559
time operation. As it stands,

1284
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,280
disruptions are a problem that cannot be

1285
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,400
solved with theory alone. So, we must

1286
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:48,400
look for an alternative.

1287
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:52,559
Uh, in 1687, Sir Isaac Newton said F=

1288
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,800
ma. News flash, it's 2025. Sir Isaac

1289
00:53:52,559 --> 00:54:00,079
Newton is dead. It is time for a new

1290
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:02,559
paradigm. F= MA plus AI.

1291
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,319
Let me give you an example.

1292
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,599
Say we wanted to have a predictor for

1293
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,359
the plasma beta. Beta is simply a ratio

1294
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,960
between the magnetic uh sorry between

1295
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,440
the plasma pressure and the magnetic

1296
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,040
pressure. The beta limit is an important

1297
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,440
consideration for keeping the plasma

1298
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,359
stable since if the plasma pressure is

1299
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,200
too high, you can't confine it with a

1300
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,079
magnetic field and instabilities will

1301
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,000
rapidly form. Beta can also be written

1302
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,800
in terms of plasma energy versus

1303
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,200
magnetic field energy. So to predict the

1304
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,880
value of beta over time and ensure we

1305
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,119
don't exceed the beta limit, we just

1306
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:40,079
need to predict energy in the plasma

1307
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:42,079
over time. Good so far. All right, cool.

1308
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,559
We can write out a simple equation for

1309
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,800
the change in stored energy over time

1310
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,800
according to various power sources and

1311
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,800
syncs.

1312
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,359
As sources we have things like omic

1313
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,000
power and auxiliary heating and sinks we

1314
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,760
have radiate power and conductive power.

1315
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,480
Most of these terms we can measure

1316
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,160
decently well in real time. Uh the

1317
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,880
conductive power is tricky though

1318
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:09,280
because it depends on energy confinement

1319
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,839
time or how long it takes energy to

1320
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,160
leave the plasma. That means it depends

1321
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:16,880
on turbulence, micro instabilities,

1322
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,520
pedal physics, blah blah blah, whatever.

1323
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:23,200
This is really annoying to work with.

1324
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:26,480
And even our best codes cannot really

1325
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,800
estimate it well in real time. So let's

1326
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,079
ignore all that and replace this term

1327
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,400
with a neural network.

1328
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,880
So here's our new equation. All we have

1329
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,559
done is replaced the energy confinement

1330
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,119
time term with the output of some

1331
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,040
datadriven model. And when we train the

1332
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,520
network, the loss function will be in

1333
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,200
terms of plasma energy. So it's not

1334
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,280
machine learning, it's scientific

1335
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,119
machine learning. Setting up the problem

1336
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,799
in this way has several very real

1337
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,799
advantages over traditional machine

1338
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,280
learning which would attempt to predict

1339
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,680
plasma energy directly.

1340
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,040
Um first off, it's interpretable. we're

1341
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,119
following the structure of this

1342
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,200
equation. I can easily see how the

1343
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,359
output changes based on the inputs. And

1344
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,640
again, we can measure most of these

1345
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:13,520
inputs. Um, second, it makes training

1346
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,359
easier. A fully blackbox approach would

1347
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,599
require a larger model, which would need

1348
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,960
more data, and that's difficult to come

1349
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,960
by when we're first commissioning new

1350
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,960
token.

1351
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,720
Um, another thing that this does is it

1352
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,200
mitigates overfitting. So because we're

1353
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,280
restricting the influence of the model

1354
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,440
to just this one component, it means

1355
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,240
that our results are more likely to be,

1356
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,319
you know, physically meaningful in some

1357
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,079
sense.

1358
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,640
So here's an example of the model in

1359
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,040
action. Uh this instance in particular

1360
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,880
is a full shot roll out. So we

1361
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,440
initialize the stored energy at the

1362
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,839
measured value at the start and then

1363
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,680
extrapolate for the entire shot. And as

1364
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:56,160
you can see, it works rather well for

1365
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,920
predicting the plasma's energy. Also, I

1366
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,839
chose this example because it highlights

1367
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,240
what the model is trying to do and what

1368
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:04,559
it is not trying to do. The output of

1369
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,400
the model may be the predicted energy

1370
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,040
confinement time, but it's not trained

1371
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,520
to get an accurate energy confinement

1372
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,440
time because even our best simulation

1373
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,319
codes have difficulty determining what

1374
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,280
that should be. Rather, we're staying in

1375
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:21,839
the realm of well understood physics. In

1376
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,079
this case, it's just power balance. Um,

1377
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,319
but we aim to extend this to other parts

1378
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,200
of tokome operation such as magnetic

1379
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,760
control which operates with ideal MHD

1380
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,319
which is an area that has proven to be

1381
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,040
at least decently robust during routine

1382
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:39,359
tokamac operation.

1383
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,040
So in conclusion,

1384
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,880
instabilities that lead to disruption

1385
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,960
are a major concern for the operation of

1386
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,880
future tokamacs. Preventing disruptions

1387
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,640
will require the ability to forecast if

1388
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,559
and when the instabilities appear. so

1389
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,559
they can be avoided.

1390
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,960
Predicting complex plasma dynamics from

1391
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,119
theory alone is extremely challenging,

1392
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,960
but scientific machine learning is a

1393
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,799
promising path forward, allowing us to

1394
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,720
combine physics with datadriven methods

1395
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,380
to improve our modeling capabilities.

1396
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,119
Thank you.

1397
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:10,640
[Applause]

1398
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,160
Any questions for Xander?

1399
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,920
Thank you for the talk. I was wondering

1400
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,000
whether you can reverse the problem. So

1401
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,400
from the from the machine learning that

1402
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,920
you're doing, can you learn back the

1403
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,760
physics of the system from reading the

1404
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,760
Yeah, sure. I mean, you can kind of see

1405
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,920
here that's essentially what's happening

1406
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,920
at least in this regime, right? Like the

1407
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,400
model doesn't know what the correct

1408
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,040
energy confinement time should be. But

1409
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,280
you see that by predicting the evolution

1410
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,640
of stored energy, you kind of back it

1411
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:43,680
out here. Yeah. I mean like this this

1412
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,280
calculated measurement is from a code

1413
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,799
running in post-processing from this

1414
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,880
particular shot. So it's like your like

1415
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,960
the best estimate from codes like what

1416
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,960
it really should be. But again you know

1417
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,920
like you can see there's disagreement

1418
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,240
even though the model you know it's

1419
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,839
accurately predicting the energy confine

1420
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,960
sorry it's predicting the stored energy

1421
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,480
but there's disagreement in the

1422
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,720
confinement time. So something somewhere

1423
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,920
isn't adding up. So which do you trust

1424
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,920
more I suppose?

1425
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,480
I was just wondering when you know after

1426
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,960
you run your model and you get your

1427
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,880
feature importance out after it is there

1428
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,640
anything that disproportionately like

1429
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,119
any inputs that disproportionately

1430
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,960
affects sort of what's going on in

1431
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,559
predicting your stored plasma energy or

1432
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,119
are you saying sort of all inputs are

1433
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,640
weighted equally the feature importance

1434
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,720
after for when you get your predicted

1435
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,799
plasma. It isn't so much that we're

1436
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:37,119
doing feature importance like we're just

1437
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:39,040
picking one term which you know there

1438
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,640
isn't really a good model for there

1439
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,079
isn't a good first principles model for

1440
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,079
and replacing that with data driven

1441
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,079
methods.

1442
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,640
Let's thank Xander again for the sake of

1443
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:54,280
time

1444
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,280
Henry come up.

1445
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,760
You want to see

1446
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,400
All right. Henry's going to talk to us

1447
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,040
about UFO disruptions in Tacoax. Cool.

1448
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,599
So, I'm Henry. I'm a graduate student at

1449
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,040
the Plasma Science Infusion Center here.

1450
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:44,079
And today I will be talking about UFO

1451
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,480
disruptions in tokamax, which sounds

1452
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:51,200
very mysterious.

1453
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,480
Screen split or zoom.

1454
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:57,680
Oh, you're the speaker view.

1455
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,680
Oh, yeah.

1456
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,040
That's a good idea.

1457
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:58,520
[Music]

1458
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,720
Is this right on screen?

1459
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,599
Share screen or Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1460
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,839
back into presenter. If you share your

1461
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:31,200
screen rather than sharing um window of

1462
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:34,839
PowerPoint. Yeah,

1463
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,839
your desktop one.

1464
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,599
That worked for me.

1465
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,480
Okay, now it looks good. Now it looks

1466
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:54,960
good. Okay, cool. Sean.

1467
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:58,559
Um, so as others mentioned earlier, so

1468
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:01,280
uh so tokamac is this tooidal

1469
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,280
um plasma where we have this tooidal

1470
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,920
strong toroidal magnetic field produced

1471
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:09,200
by external magnets and then we drive a

1472
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:13,440
current in the plasma produces this uh

1473
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,799
weaker ployal magnetic field.

1474
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,480
Um and so

1475
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:20,559
uh as you may have learned in like an

1476
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,799
introductory physics class, you know, a

1477
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,079
charged particle will approximately

1478
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:28,079
follow field lines in its helical

1479
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,559
trajectory around a magnetic field. That

1480
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,359
roughly holds for tokamax. So particles

1481
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,039
can travel quickly in the troidal or

1482
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:38,720
poloidal direction along these field

1483
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,880
lines. But any particle transport out

1484
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,440
radial perpendicular to the field lines

1485
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,720
towards the wall is restricted. Um so

1486
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,680
that's the principle of magnetic

1487
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,760
confinement. Um and as Abby and Xander

1488
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,520
mentioned you know we want to to do

1489
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,520
fusion we want to hold this tokome

1490
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,520
plasma in equilibrium for at least a few

1491
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,079
seconds hopefully longer. So that means

1492
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,039
you need our plasma to be stable. So a

1493
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:03,359
common analogy for stability is

1494
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:06,400
picturing like a ball at the bottom at a

1495
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,920
valley or peak of a hill. So in a stable

1496
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,559
equilibrium that's like a ball at the

1497
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,280
valley of a hill. You know give the ball

1498
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,359
or plasma in terms of fusion a little

1499
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:19,119
kick and it'll return to its original

1500
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,400
state. Um but in unstable equilibrium

1501
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,240
that's like the ball at a peak of a

1502
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:26,960
hill. Give it a little kick and it'll

1503
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:29,200
move uh far away from equilibrium.

1504
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,079
uh and that leads to Fabian and Xander

1505
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,119
mentioned disruptions. So there's uh

1506
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,280
plasma goes unstable and we have a

1507
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,920
sudden loss of thermal energy and

1508
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:44,240
current and you know as both Xander and

1509
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,960
Abby talked about that poses severe

1510
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:49,039
risks to machines especially as we build

1511
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,319
larger devices with higher thermal

1512
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:54,799
energies and currents to do fusion.

1513
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,559
Um, and as Xander talked about, you

1514
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,880
know, from a controls perspective, if we

1515
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,359
notice the plasma going from this nice

1516
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,760
stable regime to some unstable regime,

1517
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:06,079
we need to take a control action. Uh,

1518
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,160
either that could be we have enough time

1519
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:11,599
returning our plasma to a stable regime

1520
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:14,160
or at least mitigating the damage of a

1521
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,799
disruption.

1522
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,480
So, one type of disruptions in tokmax

1523
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:22,480
are called UFO disruptions. So in uh

1524
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,200
fusion UFOs don't have anything to do

1525
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,319
with flying saucers. Uh instead they

1526
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,400
mean a flake of a metal impur usually

1527
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,200
like from the wall like tungsten or

1528
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,280
malibdinum uh as others talked about

1529
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,839
that could flake off and fly into the

1530
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,520
plasma and that'll radiate a lot of

1531
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:44,480
power and so much so that it could uh

1532
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:47,359
radiate a significant fraction of the

1533
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,359
plasma thermal energy away and lead to a

1534
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,200
disruption. So if you're operating a

1535
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:54,400
machine, you might see some like glowing

1536
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:56,559
speck of metal fly in and enter this,

1537
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,359
you know, kind of transparent plasma and

1538
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,680
you'll just see it pop like a balloon uh

1539
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:05,839
as Xander showed.

1540
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:09,359
And so here you can see uh on uh a

1541
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:12,160
picture of CMOD uh potential origin,

1542
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:14,160
suspected origin of a UFO disruption

1543
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,720
where you can see that a piece of the

1544
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,280
wall got misaligned. You can see there's

1545
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:23,119
this leading edge in the yellow box um

1546
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:25,680
that uh where uh which experienced an um

1547
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,760
unusually high heat flux uh since that

1548
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,839
piece of wall was exposed and you can

1549
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,160
see there's some melting probably some

1550
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:36,920
liquid malibdinum droplets entered the

1551
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,920
plasma and quickly caused a disruption.

1552
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:42,000
Uh so what does this look like if uh

1553
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,920
your operating machine? So here's an

1554
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,200
example of a time trace from an

1555
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,000
experiment on Alcatore CMOD, our old uh

1556
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,000
tokamac at MIT. So in the top panel, we

1557
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,760
have the plasma current that's nice and

1558
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,079
steady around one megaamp. Um and we're

1559
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,559
about here, we're about like 1.2 seconds

1560
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,839
into the plasma pulse. So in CMO, a

1561
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,880
typical plasma pulse would be two

1562
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:07,440
seconds. Um the second panel is the

1563
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,599
malibdinum content uh in the core of the

1564
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,440
plasma. So that's nice and steady, which

1565
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,280
is good. We want that to be low. We

1566
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,079
don't want any wall material into our

1567
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,079
plasma. Um the radiated power is steady,

1568
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,200
which is nice. And then this bottom

1569
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:24,079
panel is the uh electron temperature of

1570
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,720
the core of the plasma, which has this

1571
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,119
um kind of funky sawtooth thing shape,

1572
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,880
which is the sign of a healthy plasma in

1573
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:34,559
the token. Um but then you can see in

1574
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:36,319
this red box, uh there's a sudden, uh

1575
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,039
spike in the malibdinum content in the

1576
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,480
core. the radiated power rapidly

1577
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:45,200
increases to about 8 megawws and that's

1578
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,839
uh totally exceed exceeds the heating

1579
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,880
power. So we see a quick uh thermal

1580
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,039
quench and then quench of this current.

1581
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,760
And what's particularly concerning about

1582
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:59,599
this is if you look at the time scale of

1583
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:01,520
this event uh the time we have from the

1584
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,559
you know any noticeable sign of the

1585
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,480
injection in this panel um to the

1586
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,880
disruption is about 5 milliseconds. So

1587
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,799
that is too short to take any control

1588
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,039
action. So on Spark we'll need at least

1589
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:15,520
something like 10 milliseconds of

1590
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,520
warning time to at least mitigate the

1591
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,359
damage of a disruption. We want to avoid

1592
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,080
the disruption we need longer warning

1593
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:24,719
time. And so this poses a serious

1594
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,799
problem because on in like a power plant

1595
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:31,040
if you have all these UFO disruptions

1596
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:33,120
like we had on CMOD um that could really

1597
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,679
damage the machine and that's not

1598
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:38,159
compatible with um an actual the

1599
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,000
economics of a power plant.

1600
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,640
The good news though is that not all

1601
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,759
disruption not all UFOs on CMOD cause

1602
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:49,120
disruption. So here's another example of

1603
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:51,359
um a malibdinum injection on CMOD uh

1604
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,040
from piece of the ball and this did not

1605
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,359
cause a disruption. So we have the same

1606
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,359
for signals here. Um you can see a

1607
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,319
sudden spike in the radiated power and

1608
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:03,279
malibdinum content. Um and the radiated

1609
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:05,520
power here only slightly uh exceeded the

1610
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,600
heating power which isn't shown. So you

1611
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,759
can see the core temperature decreased

1612
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,359
but the plasma did not disrupt. It also

1613
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:16,799
decreased over a longer time scale.

1614
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,880
Um and so this is you know this is okay

1615
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:21,600
and it also gives us a picture of maybe

1616
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,359
what a stability of a camod plasma might

1617
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,920
look like uh to these uh UFOs or

1618
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:31,040
radiative events. So maybe a you know

1619
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:33,040
small injection like in this one is like

1620
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,719
the ball in a valley you know give it a

1621
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,239
small kick it's stable but if you give

1622
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,600
it a large enough injection like I

1623
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:41,679
showed previously and the ball uh the

1624
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,600
plasma will move to some totally

1625
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:48,799
different state and lead to a disruption

1626
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,239
um and you know so what might set these

1627
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,920
stability limits this is something we

1628
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:53,920
want to figure out to these radiative

1629
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,760
events you know basically you know what

1630
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,440
sets the height of these peaks versus

1631
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:00,159
the depth up to the valley. So that

1632
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,920
could be things like the you know

1633
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:04,480
external heating power we're supplying

1634
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,239
to the uh plasma. It could be like the

1635
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,920
stored thermal energy of the plasma.

1636
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:11,280
Higher stored thermal energies will take

1637
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,360
longer to radiate the energy away. Um it

1638
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,960
could be also proximity to like fluid

1639
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,640
instabilities

1640
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,679
uh which can depend on like the current

1641
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,760
profile and it could also just be the

1642
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,600
operational history of the device like

1643
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,440
you know how damaged are the walls from

1644
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,159
either previous disruptions or just

1645
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:29,440
accumulated damage as you know others

1646
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,400
have talked about earlier that can

1647
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,480
happen to these walls. Um so that's kind

1648
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,920
of led to the project I'm working on. So

1649
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,360
we'd like to find some you know

1650
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,480
parameter space both of plasma

1651
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,800
parameters operational parameters where

1652
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:46,320
um in which plazas are more robust to

1653
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,560
these UFO disruptions. So maybe it takes

1654
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,520
a longer time for the plasma to disrupt

1655
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,840
where there would be ample time to uh

1656
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,000
mitigate the damage um or maybe where

1657
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,679
plasmas would just you know not disrupt

1658
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,120
and be able to recover. So we're

1659
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:03,840
labeling uh UFOs on thousands of uh

1660
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,159
discharges from Alcatore CMOD. You know,

1661
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,640
for each UFO extracting relevant uh

1662
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:10,960
plasma parameters and uh operational

1663
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,400
parameters and maybe doing some fancy

1664
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,360
machine learning to identify any

1665
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:19,360
correlations and then uh we'd like to

1666
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,960
compare to uh UFOs on other tokamac. So

1667
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,440
we recently started a collaboration with

1668
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,679
West a tokamak in France that on a

1669
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:29,800
recent campaign experienced lots of

1670
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,800
similar UFO disruptions

1671
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,520
about to say we've got about a minute

1672
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,520
left. Okay. Yeah. So thank you

1673
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,520
questions.

1674
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:40,640
[Applause]

1675
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,040
Time for a question or two and then we

1676
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,040
should call it.

1677
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,800
So these UFO based disruptions, they're

1678
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,000
basically like a thermal quench of the

1679
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,840
plasma. Is that right? Yeah. So you

1680
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,679
wouldn't need to worry about like

1681
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,960
runaway electron generation or anything

1682
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:01,600
from a UFO being tossed in. Well, so

1683
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,840
what can happen is so like one question

1684
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,440
is maybe you know how severe is the

1685
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,000
damage to a UFO because it is something

1686
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:11,440
that like radiates energy away and that

1687
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,679
radiation is uniform. Um I don't know if

1688
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,080
like that's kind of what you're Yeah.

1689
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,159
like what is the damage to the machine

1690
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,880
from these UFOs besides just like you

1691
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,960
lose your plasma? Yeah. So uh often

1692
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,280
what'll happen is it might not radiate

1693
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,520
quite all of the plasma thermal energy

1694
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,760
away. So it's not it won't radiate as

1695
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,159
much as like if you do some like massive

1696
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,719
gas injection um or like shattered

1697
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:36,320
pellet injection like uh machines use to

1698
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,760
mitigate the damage. It might radiate

1699
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:42,080
like half the stored thermal energy, but

1700
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,320
uh since that radiation is localized

1701
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,840
where the UFO is, that might change the

1702
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,880
like temperature and therefore current

1703
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:52,080
profiles, which can lead to some MHD

1704
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,800
instability um like some you know kink

1705
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,520
mode or uh tearing mode and that can

1706
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:02,719
then cause a more typical disruption

1707
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:04,480
where you have the um heat fluxes uh

1708
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:09,040
high heat fluxes on like diver on the

1709
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:12,320
diverter And um yeah these like current

1710
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,920
uh halo current stuff like that.

1711
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:17,040
Thanks.

1712
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,960
Any other quick questions? If not we

1713
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:22,600
have gone close to overtime. So let's

1714
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,600
thank Henry again.

1715
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,000
Thanks to all of you again. This was

1716
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:30,800
amazing and a lot of fun for me. And I

1717
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:34,280
will now end the Zoom recordings.

1718
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,280
Live your lives.
