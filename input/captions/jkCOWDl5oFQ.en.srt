1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,920
So, I'd like to say um I mentioned I'm

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,960
leaving. Uh 10 years ago, I was

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,480
fortunate enough to work with Kim on

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,880
what was uh the US government announced

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,000
17 innovation in manufacturing

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,199
institutes. Uh and Lionel spearheaded

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,279
the one on photonix and as a result MIT

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
won and it's uh currently one of the

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,519
most successful AIM. Photonix is one of

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,519
the innovation manufacturing institutes.

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,400
So, thank you. That's a good answer to

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,559
that question.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,320
>> Exactly.

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,280
All right. Our next speaker

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,600
have my notes here. Uh is Professor

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
Donna Freriedman. She is the FG Keys

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,559
Professor of Chemistry at MIT and the

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,160
inaugural director of quantum at MIT.

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,559
The university's hub for advancing

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,079
quantum science and technology.

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,760
Professor Freriedman is internationally

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,239
recognized for her pioneering work in

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
molecular quantum materials and for

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,600
driving collaboration across

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,920
disciplines, another theme of ours

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,400
today, to accelerate quantum discovery

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,040
and innovation. Today she'll share an

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,720
overview of the MIT Quantum Initiative,

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
highlighting how it's shaping the future

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
of quantum research, education, and real

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,439
world impact. Um, I'd like to say we

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,520
have a network break after this, but

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,759
I've canceled it for a pop quiz on all

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,759
things quantum, so pay attention.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,360
>> [applause]

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
>> Is someone gonna wire me up?

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,920
Um, okay. So, why don't I get this set?

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
Um, we will not be cancelling the

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,439
networking break. Just to be clear about

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,439
that.

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,759
Uh, you know, I used to teach general

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,600
chemistry. Um, and for nine years I

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
taught general chemistry. Honestly, it's

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,720
the most rewarding teaching that I've

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,000
ever had. But the one piece of negative

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,439
feedback I got that was consistent was

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,119
that I wasn't loud enough. And so I

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,840
dealt with this in a way I felt was

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,640
appropriate, which is I had the TAs use

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,040
caution tape to tape off the entire back

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,640
of the classroom so everyone had to come

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,879
closer to me. Um, I felt that was a

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,599
great way to use feedback from teaching

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,520
evaluations in a constructive way. Okay,

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,480
so now that I'm miked up and we have

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,599
slides, thank you. Uh, what I'm going to

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,120
do is give you a broad overview of our

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,160
new initiative. um formerly called

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,040
quantum at MIT renamed cumit by the

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,840
amazing MIT branding team. Um and so

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,920
this is the MIT quantum initiative. I'll

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
tell you how I'm thinking about this

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,800
initiative and a few things that we're

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,200
going after and ideally I'll leave

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
significant time for questions. This

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,120
overall will not be a technical talk but

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,519
I would be delighted to talk about the

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,239
technical aspects of this. What I'd

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,879
really like to use my time to do is to

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,720
frame out this initiative and talk about

71
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,000
how it's different than other quantum

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,120
initiatives that are uh rising up around

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,120
the world. So,

74
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,120
oh this is I guess not okay. We're just

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,560
going to do this. Um okay, so let me

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,480
begin by talking about how I see quantum

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
and how we're framing this current

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,599
quantum revolution. So the way that I

79
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,000
would frame it broadly speaking is the

80
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,480
first quantum revolution a 100red years

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
ago was about observing the quantum

82
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,000
nature of the universe and over a

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,599
hundred years we've moved from

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,319
observation to control. Now

85
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,879
how are we controlling it in a wide

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,159
selection of manifestations? So here we

87
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,319
have um four idealized areas and of

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,200
course networking is the subject of um

89
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,280
this session. But we can think about

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,360
quantum computers and how quantum

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,480
computers can solve certain classes of

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,760
problems quantum sensors, quantum

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,159
networks, quantum metrology, etc. And

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,840
the thing that we're focused on in the

95
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,479
MIT quantum initiative is the problems

96
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,880
that those things relate to. So MIT has

97
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,880
been superlative at tool building. On a

98
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
later slide, I'll show you the MIT

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,600
quantum network that connects from MIT

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
to Lincoln Lab that is built on the

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,639
fiber [clears throat] optic cable and

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,720
many of the things that we're familiar

103
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,600
with. But what I would argue is that MIT

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,000
solves hard problems and in the quantum

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,479
space the tool development is

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,440
accelerating rapidly. But the hard

107
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,639
problem is functionally identifying why

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,199
do we care and bringing together the

109
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,000
people who have problems that can be

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,360
solved by quantum and the quantum tool

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
developers in a co-design approach. And

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
so this is what we're focused on. We're

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,720
focused on developing quantum

114
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,280
interconnects. were focused on thinking

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
about what are the new algorithmic

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,560
problems beyond Shor's algorithm that

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,919
quantum computers will be useful for and

118
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,479
what is the user space beyond this and

119
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,840
so we're building our core tool set but

120
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,560
we're also very focused on creating this

121
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,199
additional layer around our core quantum

122
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,520
technologies.

123
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,919
So this is a um graphic in progress

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,720
illustrating some of how important this

125
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,960
is when we think about every aspect of

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,039
quantum. And so this is where we're

127
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,880
going in the future. Let me spend one

128
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:47,280
slide on the past. Um MIT's excellence

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,759
in quantum is beyond reproach. This is a

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
photograph from Endicott House. And one

131
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,240
could argue that this is the start of

132
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,479
and indeed the Endicott House website

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,720
does that this is the start of the

134
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,960
second quantum revolution. And so we've

135
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,520
all seen the photo with all of the men

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,840
from the first quantum revolution. And

137
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,160
this is potentially the analog. If

138
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,160
you're interested in the people in the

139
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
photo, the QR code will give you all of

140
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,600
their names, but it will not give you

141
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,280
the name of the dog. Um and so what does

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
it mean that this is where we started

143
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,880
the second quantum revolution? Well, the

144
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,600
idea that we could use quantum to move

145
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
from tools to function is something that

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
was scattered.

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
You can argue a revolution is what

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,240
happens when the scattered ideas

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,360
coalesce into a single constructive

150
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
movement. And so this is probably the

151
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,000
historic moment over 40 years ago when

152
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
this happened.

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
And today MIT has continued in its

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
excellence. We have quantum computing

155
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,080
and algorithms. I probably don't need to

156
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,560
tell you all about um how MIT is leading

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,160
in neutral atoms and in superconducting

158
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,360
cubits which are two of the best

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,080
candidates for quantum computers. Um we

160
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,880
have also led the way in applying

161
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,360
quantum tools towards challenges. One

162
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,120
could argue that LIGO is the best

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,599
example of success for quantum sensors.

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,919
quantum sensors detected gravitational

165
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,800
waves and that's a great example of the

166
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,039
type of problem that we want to solve

167
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,120
identify we want to know something in

168
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,199
the universe what are the tools that we

169
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,680
need to build that we need them to be

170
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,240
very delicate and then this elaborate

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,840
construction process between scientists

172
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,400
and engineers across many forms of uh

173
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,319
intellectual spaces led to the detection

174
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,960
of gravitational waves with a quantum

175
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,479
tool more relevant to networking I would

176
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,080
say that the development in clocks um by

177
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:52,479
folks like uh Vladon pictured somewhere

178
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,360
there is um a really important area.

179
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,120
Where is Vladen? He must be in

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,479
simulation. There he is next to Wolf

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Gang. Um so

182
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
these are areas that are rapidly

183
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,599
emerging. MIT has also been great at

184
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,520
translation. Cuera and Atlantic Quantum

185
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,560
are two quantum companies that have come

186
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,000
out of MIT. Among many, Atlantic Quantum

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,440
was just bought by Google. Um, and Cuer

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,680
is making the news every day uh with uh

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:28,000
their neutral atom quantum computers.

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,800
One of the largest efforts right now in

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,279
our quantum initiative is this new

192
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,440
building project. And so, let me just

193
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,200
tell you a little bit about it.

194
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
Everything I've talked about in terms of

195
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,519
co-design and bringing people together

196
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,240
relates to how we also structurally

197
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,560
co-design the elements. Um, and this is

198
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
something very similar to a lot of the

199
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,680
networking infrastructure that we talked

200
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,680
about. And so if we talk about quantum

201
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
networks, there are a lot of

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,360
applications that are frequently

203
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,440
discussed. But let me talk about my

204
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,680
favorite application. My favorite

205
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,000
application for quantum networks is

206
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,320
networking different components of a

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,640
quantum system together so that we don't

208
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,040
need a quantum classical interface.

209
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,920
Interfaces are always the problem. And

210
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,839
so if we want to I'm a chemist so I

211
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,680
think interfaces are always the problem

212
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,920
but I think that they're a large

213
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,480
challenge in quantum. If we want to

214
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,680
process our quantum information and then

215
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,920
for example get a sensor to extract data

216
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,000
from the real world and signal process

217
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,399
that if we have to go through multiple

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
classical interfaces will effectively

219
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,760
lose the power of these quantum systems.

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,560
So what we're thinking about with this

221
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,680
system is creating an allquantum

222
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,200
ecosystem. And if we could create an

223
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,880
allquantum ecosystem, this would be a

224
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,480
first um type of system. And so this is

225
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
how we're thinking about building it

226
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,040
out. Now, of course, to mirror the

227
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,360
previous talk, the key ingredient here

228
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,519
are interconnects. We need to keep

229
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
everything in a single quantum space. If

230
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,440
you ask some companies, interconnects

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
are most useful for networking dilution

232
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
fridges to make larger quantum

233
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,640
computers. I think that's very important

234
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,440
too and I think that but I also think

235
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,920
that that's a clear path forward that we

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760
will invest in regardless right quantum

237
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,920
interconnects are important everybody's

238
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
working on quantum interconnects to

239
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,079
integrate different quantum computers

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
together considering all quantum

241
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,640
ecosystems where we add in sensors and

242
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,560
other components and our quantum system

243
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,720
isn't a quantum computer it's a quantum

244
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,160
computer a quantum network a quantum

245
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,079
sensor that enables us to have new

246
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,480
knowledge about the world around us,

247
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,360
whether that's a biological solution

248
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,760
where we're looking at an enzyme or a

249
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,640
material where we're looking for subtle

250
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,160
differences. Uh, for example, you could

251
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,079
say hotspots in a battery. So, in all of

252
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,920
these applications, keeping the

253
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,920
information quantum is very important.

254
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
Okay, perfect. I'm just going to end

255
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,320
with our leadership structure. Jon

256
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,640
Yotter from uh Lincoln is missing from

257
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,800
this. This morning uh we got official

258
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,680
confirmation that we can add her. You

259
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,480
know what Lincoln is like. Um so that

260
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,800
took a little bit of time. Um and I also

261
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,519
want to advertise our launch event. We

262
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,920
have a bunch of amazing speakers

263
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,600
including the director of IBM research,

264
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,360
a couple of Nobel laureates, um my dean

265
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,160
in the school of science, um

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,240
Eric Lander, uh who will talk about

267
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,279
early adoption of quantum techn of

268
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,880
technologies globally, not quantum. And

269
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,720
so I think I left some time for

270
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,680
questions, which is most of what I'd

271
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,680
like to do here. So it thank
