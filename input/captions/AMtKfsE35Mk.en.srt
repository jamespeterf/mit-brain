00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
Let's start with looking at the standard

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,520
definition of money. So money is a tool

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,679
that helps us to measure value. It's a

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,400
tool that allows us to [music] um

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,480
exchange products and services and it's

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
a tool to store value. But then the

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
question is what is the value? Where

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,119
does the value come from? [music] Money

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,400
today is fiat money. So money is not

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,600
backed by physical values like gold but

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,599
money is backed [music] by the

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,760
government and issued by the central

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,399
bank. So the value of money has to do

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,719
with our trust in the government, our

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,300
trust in [music] the economic system.

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,360
Money um is basically a legal construct.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,239
[music] So money sits at the edge

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
between our economic system and our

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
political system.
