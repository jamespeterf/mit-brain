1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,320
okay hi everybody um welcome to the

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,240
broad MIT Series in chemical biology and

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,599
the first seminar of the spring Series

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,720
so I'm delighted to introduce Professor

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,439
Wilfred vanderdonk he's here from

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,560
University of Illinois Urbana champagne

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,480
um to tell us about his terrific science

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,640
this hour just as a little introduction

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
um Wilford began his education in the

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,800
Netherlands and came to the US where he

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,200
did his PhD Rice University and then

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,600
came to MIT for a postto with Joanne

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,800
stubby so welcome back yet again um and

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,800
then began his career at University of

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,320
Illinois where he um Rose through the

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,680
ranks and is currently the Richard E

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Hecker endowed sharing chemistry and

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,000
also an investigator of the Howard

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Hughes Medical Institute um since 2008

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,120
so Wilford has received many awards um

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,280
I'll just mention two of the most recent

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,120
um in 2021 he was elected into The

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,040
National academ of Sciences and is the

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,400
2024 recipient of the Bader award from

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
the American Chemical Society this is an

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,479
award for excellence in either

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,479
bioorganic or bioinorganic

28
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,159
chemistry um his research program really

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,079
is at the intersection of chemistry and

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,640
biology focused on Discovery and

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,799
fundamental understanding of

32
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,280
biosynthetic Pathways enzymology um and

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,920
new natural products so Wilfred welcome

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,920
back delighted for your talk right

35
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,040
thanks Liz can you hear me okay yeah

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,759
working out uh thanks for the kind

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,280
introduction and I also like to thank

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,119
the faculty of the broad and the MIT

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,079
chemistry department for the invitation

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,159
uh I was really looking forward to this

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,719
uh ahed invited me about two years ago I

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,439
think but I couldn't at the time make it

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,600
for various reasons and so I've really

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,840
been looking forward to my visit and it

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,439
has been as in operational as I

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,360
anticipated so it's been really great um

47
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,119
the title that I gave uh again a long

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,280
time ago uh was genom mining for new

49
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,640
natural products as well as new

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,879
chemistry um um I will mostly focus on

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,720
the latter part so genom mining for new

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,480
chemistry and so uh why would we genom

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,519
mine for new chemistry well of course

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,800
there's the inherent interest in the

55
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,160
chemistry that takes place in nature but

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,959
also over the last 10 15 years I been

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,040
another very good reason to look for new

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,360
enzimatic reactions and that is uh the

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,800
uh real uh Embrace that the industry has

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,959
shown to using biocatalysis in the

61
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,480
biosynthesis and chemoenzymatic

62
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,680
synthesis of um Pharmaceuticals and so I

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,879
think a real watershed moment was this

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,519
2010 paper from U scientists at Merc and

65
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,720
codexes where they showed they could

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,200
take an enzyme and through directed

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,120
Evolution use that enzyme to set that

68
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,920
stereo Center here in this then clinical

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,280
candidate Genovia and so that trend has

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,799
continued and so uh in process chemistry

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,000
uh using enzymes has become a very

72
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,480
popular way to reduce waste and increase

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,879
uh the efficiency of making

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,360
pharmaceutical so a few more examples

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,360
are shown here these are molecules that

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,200
were discovered by Medicinal Chemistry

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,799
using purely synthetic chemistry uh but

78
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,159
once they went into clinical development

79
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,439
and uh of kilograms were needed

80
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,120
chemoenzymatic routes turned out to be

81
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,640
really the most efficient um and so uh

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,120
if you're a process chemist in industry

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,840
and you are given a molecule that is

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,080
already set the molecule has gone

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,200
through the development and now it needs

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,640
to be made in large scale for the

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,040
clinical trials uh if you want to make

88
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,840
it chemically you have a 100 Years of

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,799
methodology development to probably come

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,159
up with with a dozen or more routes to

91
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,200
make the molecule but if you want to use

92
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,560
enzymes that is not the case actually

93
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,920
the number of enzymes that are available

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,840
that allow you to use enzymatic steps in

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,079
a chemoenzymatic pathway uh is very very

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,440
limited and indeed all of these examples

97
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,120
use enzymes that did known chemistry

98
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,960
that had been studied previously the

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
directed Evolution essentially allowed

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,360
them to take uh uh substrates that they

101
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,919
naturally do not take and so if you read

102
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,720
these papers there's often statement

103
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,639
like this this is taken I forget from

104
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,320
which one it's a quote that for this to

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,520
continue we really need to discover new

106
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,199
enzymatic transformation such that

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,400
hopefully at some point for the

108
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,320
biocatalysis you also have

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,440
multiple retrosynthetic routes by which

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,720
you could try and make a molecule very

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,000
efficiently and so that made uh that

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,680
started making us think as to how do you

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,560
discover fundamentally new enzimatic

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,280
reactions and so there's a number of

115
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,360
ways I think you can do it you can do it

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
the way

117
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,880
Francis Arnold and people coming out of

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,919
the Arnold lab have done where you

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,479
essentially have enzymes do reactions

120
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,759
for which there is no natural

121
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
counterpart and that has been very

122
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,720
successful uh another way to do it is to

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,319
say okay there's still thousands upon

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,319
thousands of unknown proteins genes that

125
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,560
are annotated in the databases as

126
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,000
hypothetical proteins or domain of

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,400
unknown function and some of those might

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,919
also be doing interesting chemistry and

129
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,800
especially in the realm of natur

130
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,840
products there's there's amazing

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,280
structures and of course these need to

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,280
be biosynthesized and there might be a

133
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,240
really interesting chemistry that is

134
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,919
hiding there and so we started then a

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,639
program where we wanted to intentionally

136
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,120
look for enzymes that we didn't know

137
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,400
what they might be doing now that's

138
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,120
easier said than done my colleague John

139
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,240
ger for about 10 years uh ran this

140
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,720
enzyme function initiative and the whole

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,000
goal there was to assign functions to

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
proteins of unknown function and he

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,199
would tell you and his colleagues would

144
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,880
tell you that the hardest thing is to

145
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,479
figure out what the substrate is going

146
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,479
to be of the enzyme if you don't know

147
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,120
what the substrate is you cannot really

148
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,039
know what the enzyme is doing and that's

149
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,759
where we thought we had a really unique

150
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,039
angle because we had been working on the

151
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,599
biosynthesis of a class of natural

152
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,199
products that are called rips these are

153
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,000
ribosomally synthesized peptides they're

154
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,039
Gene encoded and then because these

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,919
structures are limited to the natural

156
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,039
amino acids what nature does is a large

157
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,080
number of post transation modifications

158
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,199
on part of that peptide that we call the

159
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,000
cor peptide I'll show you a few

160
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,039
structures these are often

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,560
macrocyclizations but also all kinds of

162
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,840
other chemical

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Transformations a leop peptide that is

164
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,560
important to guide these enzymes is then

165
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,840
cut off and then you have the natural

166
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,120
product class that I now referred to as

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,000
ribs and so um rips were long believed

168
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,000
to be a very small group of natural

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,319
products but with all of these genomes

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
that have come out we now know that it's

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,120
one of the largest class classes of

172
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,080
natural products on Earth and that is

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,720
because they're made by all domains of

174
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,319
life in all domains of life so ukaria

175
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,879
ARA bacteria and among the bacteria

176
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,560
almost all Fila make ribs so it's not um

177
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:26,039
limited to say tinam my seeds or or C

178
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,120
bacteria and so if we think about this

179
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,319
pathway it's really perfectly set up for

180
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,560
a number of different things one is to

181
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,360
do genom mining for new natural products

182
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,759
I'm not really going to talk about that

183
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,440
today uh because everything here is Gene

184
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,560
encoded and hence you can turn on the

185
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,720
computer look for biosynthetic Gene

186
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,039
clusters that are making molecules that

187
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,520
you've never seen and you can then

188
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,080
transport these Pathways into hyicus

189
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,680
host like eoli yeast and so on but for

190
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,159
this stock it also is a great way to

191
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,360
discover new chemistry suppose that this

192
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,759
is a hypothetical Gene cluster and that

193
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,440
the computer says about the yellow and

194
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,240
the green enzymes that those are domains

195
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,639
of unknown functions or uh enzymes that

196
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,879
are hypothetical proteins because the

197
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,599
little Gene there en codes for the

198
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,520
precursor peptide we have a direct route

199
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,440
into assigning the function of these

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,520
enzymes we know that one of the genes in

201
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,599
that cluster is making an enzyme that

202
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,280
does the first reaction on that peptide

203
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,399
the product of that is going to be taken

204
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,560
by the next enzyme and so by

205
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,560
coexpressing different combinations of

206
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,159
enzymes we can walk towards the

207
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,680
functions of these hypothetical proteins

208
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,519
so in our lab we love biosynthetic Gene

209
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
clusters that have a lot of domains of

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,320
unknown functions or hypothetical

211
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,000
proteins because that allows us to find

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
new chemistry

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,920
potentially and so um let me first show

214
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,000
you a few structures to have an idea as

215
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,920
to what are these post transation

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,880
modifications that are introduced um and

217
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,240
so here are just five of what are now

218
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,399
more than 50 classes of natural products

219
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,279
in the thiopeptides you see that there's

220
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,440
Pines and thool and one thing that we

221
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,760
see often is that the amides that of

222
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,120
course are a vulnerability for peptides

223
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
with respect to proteolytic degradation

224
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,519
that often these are converted into

225
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,320
other structures such as these thool and

226
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:30,040
oxazoles or tho amides or meated amides

227
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,959
or n2c cyclization side chain

228
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:37,800
cyclization as I mentioned many of these

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:41,279
have macrocyclic structures to uh uh uh

230
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,000
impose a confirmational constraint that

231
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,040
makes these molecules

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,760
active and so uh the first example where

233
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,680
we were able to to use this approach to

234
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,000
assign function to proteins of um

235
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
unknown function is a little dated now

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,880
but it sets the rest of the story my two

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
posto ching and Michael F decided to

238
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,440
work on this biosynthetic Gene cluster

239
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,279
from pseudomona syring that's a plant

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,360
pathogen and we had a number of

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
questions we didn't know what the enzyme

242
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,040
encoded by this dark blue Gene might be

243
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,040
doing and we didn't know what this

244
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,320
protein encoded by the gray Gene H was

245
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,079
doing but we knew it was a member of the

246
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,480
domain of unknown function 692 and we

247
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,440
also knew that there was a really large

248
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,120
protein family of for which no functions

249
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
had been determined previously so using

250
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,320
this combinatorial co-expression in Ni

251
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
coli Chi and Michael were able to show

252
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,200
that the first step is actually

253
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,600
catalyzed by that blue the enzyme

254
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,240
encoded by the blue Gene and it does a

255
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,440
reaction that they hadn't really

256
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,639
anticipated so the enzyme adds 16 from

257
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,639
cine TRNA to the end of the little

258
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,519
peptide that is encoded there so

259
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,079
essentially the same chemistry that the

260
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,880
ribosome would do but without a template

261
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,519
no mRNA is present there so we didn't

262
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,800
really know what to make of that but it

263
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,440
became clear that it must be on pathway

264
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,959
because after the cine is added now

265
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,959
these Dove 692 enzyme and it needs this

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,440
uh partner Protein that's why we also

267
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,240
have color that in Gray and it does a

268
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,480
reaction that we have really never seen

269
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,880
before so the enzyme excises the beta

270
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,920
carbon as form8 we can show that using

271
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,079
carbon 13 and then reattaches the sulfur

272
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,360
to the alpha carbon with retention of

273
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,720
configuration that the steps after that

274
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,720
are a little bit more traditional so the

275
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,360
two yellow proteins also collaborate the

276
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,480
E enzyme takes Sam and turns it into

277
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,880
carboxy Stam here and then the F enzyme

278
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,480
then transfers that carboxy methyl group

279
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,600
to that sulfur to make now an analog of

280
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,120
glutamate we call it thog glutamate and

281
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
then there's a protease in the gene

282
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,560
cluster that then cuts off what we have

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,040
just made we regenerate the precursor

284
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,839
peptide it can now go around and around

285
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,160
and around so we have catalytic use of

286
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,720
the precursor peptide it's a scaffold on

287
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,920
which a natural product is being bound

288
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,160
so when we had discovered this we

289
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,120
wondered okay how often do we find these

290
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,079
type of Pathways so I'm going to tell

291
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,760
you about other examples of these

292
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,160
enzymes which we now call Pearls for

293
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,199
peptide Amino TRNA ligases I'm going to

294
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,560
start out by telling you more about this

295
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:32,079
Dove 692 enzyme family of which there's

296
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,360
about 16,000 in the current genomes and

297
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,320
so uh if we make a so-called sequence

298
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,519
similarity network uh using the the

299
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,079
tools that have been developed at the

300
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,160
enzyme function Institute uh something

301
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,279
that was started with py babit uh these

302
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,079
types of uh Renditions of sequence

303
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,600
similarity networks and then John girl

304
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,320
really has popularized them so every dot

305
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,360
that you're looking at is an enzyme if

306
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,519
the dots are close together then there's

307
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,000
high enzyme similarity to thoughts are

308
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,240
further away from one another the

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,440
sequence similarity is lower and then

310
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,360
you can set certain cut offs uh by which

311
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,480
the enzyme families are uh put into

312
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,920
different groups so in this particular

313
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,320
at this particular cut off the

314
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,079
assumption is that these blue enzymes

315
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,639
are all isofunctional they're going to

316
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,600
do the same reaction but a reaction that

317
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,480
is different from say the red ones or

318
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,240
the pink ones or the orange ones so I

319
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
just showed you what the green ones are

320
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
doing here and actually as we were

321
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,079
working on this another paper came out

322
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,279
from Amy Rosen frikes lab that worked on

323
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,120
the pink ones and she showed that that

324
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,959
enzyme family does again a remarkable

325
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,160
chemical transformation I challenge you

326
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:46,760
to draw a mechanism to turn ayine into

327
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,800
an oxazalone tho Ami there so now we had

328
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,360
two enzymes two really unusual reactions

329
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,240
but 16,000 others and so we wanted to

330
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,560
see what else was in this enzyme family

331
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,959
um and so before I show you some of uh

332
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,399
other examples um uh uh of groups uh on

333
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,680
this sequence similarity Network let me

334
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,959
first show you a crystal structure of

335
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,240
one of the pink ones that was solved in

336
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:13,519
China in changu by way Chang and his

337
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,880
co-workers and so in blue you see the

338
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,120
protein this is the dove 692 in pink is

339
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
its partner protein that binds the

340
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,920
substrate and in yellow you see the

341
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,720
substrate and so when we zoom into the

342
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,120
active side we see that this is an

343
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,839
unusual enzyme family because it's a try

344
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
nuclear iron dependent enzyme uh and so

345
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,320
if you look at all 16,000 of these

346
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,240
proteins the ligans for three irons are

347
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,160
are almost entirely

348
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,880
conserved and so that was U very

349
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,120
interesting the 16 of the substrate you

350
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:52,240
can see makes a a a bonding contact to

351
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,639
one of those irons and So based on the

352
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,399
structure and the the the reaction that

353
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,480
our enzyme catalyzes we can then propose

354
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,320
a mechanism M and so that is shown here

355
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,759
so I'll first go over the mechanism and

356
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,480
then I'll tell you what our support is

357
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,440
for this mechanism and so we know that

358
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
we have three irons in our enzyme also

359
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,079
we have also Crystal structures with we

360
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,440
Chang in a collaboration that also

361
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,800
contain three irons we know that at

362
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,320
least one of them needs to be reduced we

363
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,440
don't know if they all need to be

364
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,480
reduced but if they're all oxidized we

365
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,600
have no activity um we know we need

366
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,319
oxygen uh the reaction doesn't go

367
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,560
without oxygen and so we believe that we

368
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,199
first make a feric superoxo species and

369
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,240
we think that that does a hydrogen atom

370
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,000
abstraction of this activated position

371
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,639
here at the beta carbon that would

372
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
generate this radical and you can

373
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,639
actually draw a number of different

374
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,720
mechanisms to go from this radical to

375
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,560
this U tho Hemi

376
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,800
ml um and so this is just one way by

377
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,079
which you can draw this this also can go

378
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,399
by by other uh steps if that happens

379
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,959
then we make an iron for oxide species

380
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,440
uh next to this alcohol and we believe

381
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,040
that that might do an oh

382
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,399
oxidation of course an O bond is very

383
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,360
strong but we're also making a new o

384
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,000
Bond so thermodynamically it should be

385
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,880
okay and in another enzyme system that

386
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,839
is a mononuclear iron dependent enzyme

387
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,000
in collaboration with Marty Bolinger and

388
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,079
carsen creps I think we have very strong

389
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,600
evidence that a FAL can oxidize an O

390
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,279
bond to make an oxygen centered radical

391
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
um what probably pulls the whole system

392
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,680
forward is that if you do generate that

393
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,680
radical very rapidly you will do a

394
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,160
bision to make a much more stabilized

395
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,279
radical and a glycal type radical that

396
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,160
could potentially then do a rebound to

397
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,279
make the observed carbon sulfur Bond and

398
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,399
it could then also uh lead to hydrolysis

399
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,160
of this thioester to give the two

400
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,079
products so the support that we have for

401
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,360
for this is that if we put dudum on the

402
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,000
alpha carbon we see no change the derium

403
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,079
is retained so we don't believe that

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,880
there's any chemistry that happens on

405
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,919
the alpha carbon if we put the tyum on

406
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,160
the beta carbons one ends up in the

407
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,679
product the other is lost into solvent

408
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,240
as we would expect perhaps the most uh

409
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,120
telling is that if we do the reaction

410
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,400
with O8 labeled oxygen only one O8 ends

411
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,039
up in the product suggesting that the

412
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,360
second oxygen comes from solvent comes

413
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,039
from water and so of course that doesn't

414
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,840
prove this mechanism and we would love

415
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,400
to try and trap some of these

416
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,280
intermediates as we did do in for that

417
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,039
other enzyme in this paper thus far that

418
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,160
hasn't really been successful and so

419
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,640
we're still working uh with Marty in Kon

420
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,320
to see if we can get more direct

421
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,840
spectroscopic evidence for this

422
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,600
particular mechanism now a few points uh

423
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,400
the first thing I I want you to remember

424
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,679
that here we have a carbon that is at

425
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,840
the Tho alahh oxidation state and that's

426
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,760
because later on I will show it again

427
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,640
but I will not show these first steps

428
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,960
leading to that uh that

429
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,240
intermediate okay so back to the

430
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,240
sequence similarity with network then uh

431
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,400
can we discover other reactions in this

432
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,080
enzyme family and so I'm first going to

433
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,600
tell you about the orange family here it

434
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,360
seems like I'm starting to run out of

435
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,799
battery I'll change it in a second um

436
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,760
and so Richard aeku he's a he was a

437
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,600
postdoc in the lab started working on

438
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,679
that he picked one gene cluster from

439
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,280
chisso bacterium it contains a precursor

440
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,480
peptide that you can see the sequence of

441
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,120
all orange proteins from the previous

442
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,039
slide they have sequences of precursor

443
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,159
peptides that always end in the last

444
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,440
seven amino acids that are identical

445
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,600
that are bolded here and so what Richard

446
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,280
was able to show that if you then put

447
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,320
this into uh eoli you do

448
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,080
coexpressions if you coexpress the

449
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,799
substrate with the dove 692 enzyme in

450
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,760
red and this partner protein in Pur

451
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,520
purple you get an addition of 10 dotons

452
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,280
and so the question is what is 10 doton

453
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,039
we can treat the peptide with an prodas

454
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,200
that Cleaves right here at this lysine

455
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,919
and from that we know that the the 10

456
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:20,960
Daltons are added at C Terminus of the

457
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:23,919
peptide and so um um um uh at that

458
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
moment then uh we decided we need to do

459
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,840
NMR that's really the only way by which

460
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,120
we were able to determine what exactly

461
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,679
the uh the change in mass is due to and

462
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,039
it turns out that the change of of 10

463
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:40,360
Delton is a very complicated change

464
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,080
because it's removal of four hydrogens

465
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,600
and then addition of a meth group so

466
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,840
it's minus four and then plus 14 and

467
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,799
that gives you the net change of + 10 I

468
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,880
must have put them in the wrong way I

469
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:59,919
had 50% chance

470
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,919
that and so the um

471
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,280
let me let me change them

472
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,440
around guess I can do it the

473
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,080
oldfashioned way so that's the reaction

474
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,919
that the enzyme catalyzes as you can see

475
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,280
a lot of different things are happening

476
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,960
here and so the um the enzyme uh makes

477
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,360
two rings so that's loss of two

478
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,000
hydrogens to make this ring a loss of

479
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,120
two hydrogens to make that r ring so

480
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,559
that's a loss of four hydrogens and then

481
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,720
that is the addition of the methyl group

482
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,760
so to orient you this sulfur makes a new

483
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,320
Bond to this carbon this sulfur migrates

484
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,640
to that carbon instead of breaking this

485
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,360
bond that I showed you previously in

486
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,080
this case we're going to break this Bond

487
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,919
and this nitrogen picks up that carbonal

488
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,760
to make this hento in structure and then

489
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,480
the sulfur that migrates to the alpha

490
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,679
carbon is then methylated and we have

491
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,000
shown that that comes from Acid anol

492
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,320
methionine we don't know the absolute

493
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,559
stereochemistry yet here at these two

494
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,280
positions and so we have a lot of NMR

495
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,840
data that supports the structure and

496
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,919
we've done quite a bit of labeling data

497
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,000
so we know that these Alpha carbons end

498
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,279
up at these positions more tellingly if

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,240
we label the carbonal of the cines we

500
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,480
can show that this carbonal ends up here

501
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,840
at the hentain so certainly a very uh

502
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,880
unusual reaction not sure that this is

503
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,520
going to be a useful reaction but

504
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,840
certainly new chemistry um and so we

505
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,559
have renamed the duve 692 family then as

506
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,480
the mon as the multinuclear iron

507
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:43,000
dependent oxidation enzymes why not

508
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,480
truclear well because there are some uh

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,760
uh this uh disagreement in the

510
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,600
literature between two groups on not our

511
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,679
enzymes but another enzyme whether the

512
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,080
active enzyme is truclear or dinuclear

513
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,880
and so for now we just want to make sure

514
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,640
that we don't bias that argument um and

515
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,840
so then going back uh to the the

516
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,200
potential mechanism we don't have any

517
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,720
evidence for this mechanism but as you

518
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,559
will see there will be similarities and

519
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,720
commonalities between the previous

520
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,320
mechanism and I start out with that

521
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,720
first intermediate that I I reminded you

522
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,159
to remember a tho alide and then a feric

523
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,400
superoxide so in the previous mechanism

524
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,640
we had this hydroxy attack it to do a

525
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,720
hydration in this case we use the

526
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,000
nitrogen of the next amide X amino acid

527
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,520
to attack the Tho alide that would give

528
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,559
us this intermediate beta lactam then we

529
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,559
believe that this nitrogen which we

530
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,760
remember need to pick up this carbonal

531
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,320
could attack the

532
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,600
betam and then we would generate an

533
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,480
alcohol that is now set up for the same

534
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,000
type of chemistry which is

535
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:55,080
oxidation bet decision generation of a

536
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,279
radical that now can form an episulfide

537
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,480
and then the second cinee can open that

538
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,720
up and we can meate at sulfur and that's

539
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
why we really want to know the

540
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,760
stereochemistry and are working hard

541
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,720
towards understanding the

542
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,000
stereochemistry because there's clear

543
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,440
predictions here about what the stereo

544
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,760
chemistry ought to be uh based on this

545
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,120
mechanism so whether this is correct we

546
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,320
don't know uh but we do know that it at

547
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,279
least uses similar type of chemistry as

548
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,440
the previous mechanism and Amy in her

549
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,880
mechanisms for the sand aaum

550
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,200
biosynthetic enzymes also has very

551
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,720
similar mechanisms with respect to what

552
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,919
might be

553
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,600
happening so I've shown you now three

554
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,799
reactions all on cyes and all

555
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,120
unprecedented and and not predictable I

556
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,640
don't want to leave you with the idea

557
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,200
that these enzymes only act on cyes

558
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,480
because we have several examples where

559
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,440
that's not the case and so one example

560
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,200
is shown here this was the work of den

561
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,480
noen who is now here at MIT in Michael

562
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,640
L's lab he was a joint student with my

563
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,039
colleague Doug Mitchell and he worked on

564
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,000
this cluster from bural area tylon

565
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,120
densers and again this this combination

566
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,919
of enzymes we have never seen before we

567
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,600
like that and he was able to show that

568
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,360
there's a B12 radical Sam enzyme that

569
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,720
first methylates on the beta carbon of

570
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,200
this thyrosine with the shown

571
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,039
stereochemistry and then a p450 takes

572
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,480
the two tyrosines and it crosslinks them

573
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,240
but it does so with with the

574
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,880
stereochemistry that I'm showing you

575
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,679
there so you get only one atropisomer

576
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,159
and we know that because we have a

577
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,720
microed structure of the of the product

578
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,120
and then the M Neo ax as I already

579
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,840
mentioned not on ayine in this case it

580
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,720
acts on a c terminal aspartate and turns

581
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,360
that into a beta keto amino acid a

582
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,919
structure that medicinal chemist have

583
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,720
used for a long time to make Inhibitors

584
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,039
of proteases and then the last step this

585
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,120
methyl transferase here Mephiles at this

586
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,520
position and then was able to show that

587
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,520
this is indeed a syis proteas inhibit we

588
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,360
do not know why the bural area is making

589
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,200
this molecule but again uh uh

590
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,919
unprecedented chemistry uh and the final

591
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,159
example that I want to show you is

592
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,840
actually from unpublished work for my

593
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,760
current postdoc shakar party so he

594
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,720
picked yet another Gene cluster in this

595
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,200
case again a combination of biosynthetic

596
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,559
enzymes that we have not seen before

597
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,320
there about a few hundred examples of

598
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:31,080
those and uh this uh this sequence

599
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,559
similarity logo shows that this part of

600
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,279
the substrate that is bolded here is

601
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:39,720
fully conserved in all of these several

602
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,520
100 precursor peptides and so what Sher

603
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,080
was able to show is that in this case

604
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,240
the mnio enzyme acts first so all of

605
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,279
these pathways are strictly ordered uh

606
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,840
in this case nothing happens until the M

607
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,600
Neo has done a reaction and as you can

608
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,320
see the chemistry is again very

609
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,120
different in this case it takes two

610
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,799
phenol alanines and makes two or

611
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,159
tyrosines and then after that this

612
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,200
arginase acts and it takes this fully

613
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,600
conserved Arginine and turns it into an

614
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
ornithine and then another radical sem

615
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,440
enzyme does again

616
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,360
macrocyclization to now make a different

617
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,559
ring pattern uh and again we do not know

618
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,360
why these organisms are making that at

619
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,399
the moment we're mostly focus on

620
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,760
discovering new enzymatic chemistry as I

621
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:26,760
said in the title of course we're very

622
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,159
interested also why these organisms are

623
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,279
making all of these macrocyclic ites but

624
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,279
for now we have put that on the side and

625
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,679
we will go back to that later um and so

626
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,159
I've shown you now five different

627
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,440
reactions all unprecedented and other

628
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,799
labs have also contributed to these and

629
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,320
so Mo sayos who actually was a a student

630
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,360
here with Joanne uh he showed yet

631
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,960
another reaction where this carbon

632
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,679
nitrogen bond in the backbone of a

633
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,440
peptide is broken to make an amidated

634
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:01,080
peptide and the group of Jacob du brisan

635
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,799
in France showed yet another reaction on

636
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,320
cysteine where cysteine is converted to

637
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,640
this tho

638
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,159
oxisol so I don't know if any of these

639
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,640
reactions will ever be useful for a

640
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,919
directed Evolution campaign to make

641
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,480
structures I do know that they make a

642
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
lot of heterocycles and of course

643
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,799
heterocycles are quite frequently found

644
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,000
in natural products and whether so

645
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:27,799
whether it's an oxazalone or henin or

646
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,159
thio oxisol these are all structures

647
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,200
that we have haven't really seen uh in

648
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,600
in natural

649
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,120
products so let me return then to these

650
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,799
Pearl enzymes these enzymes that add an

651
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,880
amino acid at the end of a

652
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,120
peptide at first glance a silly reaction

653
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,080
because you could have encoded the cine

654
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,360
on the DNA and the ribosome could have

655
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,919
made this but after we figured out this

656
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,600
catalytic cycle it makes a lot of sense

657
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,279
because you now have a catalytic peptide

658
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,480
you don't have to make 50 amino acid

659
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,919
peptide every single time you want to

660
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,960
make a natural product and so uh we have

661
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,240
then started looking for other enzymes

662
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,880
like these uh and at last count we have

663
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,799
now eight of them uh that all add

664
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,039
different amino acids and all in an

665
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,840
amino ail TRNA dependent fashion and I

666
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,399
think when we're all going to be done

667
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,200
with this we're going to

668
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,000
find cases of all 20 amino acids uh I'm

669
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,559
pretty sure that there's going to be

670
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,519
enzymes out there that add or any of the

671
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,080
20 natural amino acids uh to the end of

672
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,799
of peptides they all make different

673
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,840
natural products the biosynthetic

674
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,039
pathways diverge after the addition of

675
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,559
the the amino acid but we think that

676
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,360
this is quite interesting given the the

677
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,679
the real interest there is currently in

678
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,519
the pharmaceutical industry in peptidic

679
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,480
uh

680
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,880
Therapeutics um because those can be

681
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,600
made by solid phas peptide synthesis but

682
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,000
maybe some steps also can be done using

683
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,000
biocatalysis and so then these enzymes

684
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,600
might actually be quite useful um and so

685
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,720
we have started to try to understand how

686
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,720
they work and so first some isotopic

687
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,559
labeling studies that were done by Zang

688
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,559
gang Zang uh he first put an O8 at the

689
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:18,159
end of the peptide was able to that that

690
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:21,440
O8 is actually U liberated as phosphate

691
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,840
the reaction requires ATP and so we

692
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,799
believe that we first get a

693
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,240
phosphorilation to make an asil

694
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,440
phosphate activated carboxilate that the

695
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,440
nitrogen then of the amino ail TRNA

696
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,559
attacks that to make the Amite Bond and

697
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,480
then doing the reaction in O8 labeled

698
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:41,279
water showed that actually the activated

699
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,760
Esther that the ribosome uses to make

700
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:48,919
proteins or enzyme just just hydes it so

701
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,440
it seems very wasteful uh it seems a

702
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,120
prime example of the opportunistic

703
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,159
manner of evolution presumably all these

704
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,720
organisms that use these type of enzymes

705
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,120
they benefit from the natural product

706
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,279
that making uh but they're certainly not

707
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,399
making it in the energetically most most

708
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,360
efficient manner um and so um um we

709
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:11,799
don't have Crystal structures of these

710
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,000
enzymes H so we don't really know how

711
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,840
this all fits together but then when

712
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,840
Alpha 3 came out last year my current

713
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,679
post Joseline Ramos fuera put it all

714
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,440
together so protein peptide substrate

715
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,559
ATP and

716
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,279
TRNA and the the the the prediction is

717
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,200
rather stunning I think U knowing that

718
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,120
there are no examples of structural

719
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,519
information on these so Alpha fold

720
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,240
places the three prime end of the TRNA

721
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,360
where the amino acid would be attached

722
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,880
right in the same vicinity where it

723
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,399
places the C terminal of the precursor

724
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,440
peptide and that c terminal carboxilate

725
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,200
is right next to the gamma phosphates of

726
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,960
ATP so it's exactly set up for the

727
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,519
chemistry that we know the enzyme does

728
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,440
but that Alpha fold of course doesn't

729
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,200
know

730
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,039
and so uh the the phosphorilation and

731
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,760
then here is where the amino acid would

732
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,960
be attached ready to attack that

733
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,600
carboxilate there and so uh uh in three

734
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,639
dimensions is a little bit better to see

735
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,399
and the other thing I want to point out

736
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:19,480
up here it looks like there is a contact

737
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:21,000
with the anti-codon loop of the TRNA and

738
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,919
so it seems like there's two-o

739
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,519
interaction in order to make sure that

740
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:29,360
the right amino acid gets put on both

741
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,080
based on the anticodon as well as based

742
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,039
on the uh on the the amino acids so

743
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,200
we're trying to investigate this right

744
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:39,720
now again uh my student Den W and he's

745
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,200
working together with hero zuga who has

746
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,399
this Flex asme technology that allows

747
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,480
you to change the TRNA and the amino

748
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,919
acid and put different amino acids on

749
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,000
different trnas and vice versa to see

750
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,399
whether that recognition is indeed real

751
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,320
of the anti-codon loop um jeline has

752
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,279
already made the mutations of all the

753
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,639
conserved residues that Alpha fold

754
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:04,600
predicts are important for recognition

755
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:06,720
of ATP and of the amino ail TRNA and

756
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,600
indeed if we mutate that tyrosine or

757
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,440
that Arginine or that Arginine that are

758
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,000
fully conserved and that are making

759
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,919
contact to this the the three prime CCA

760
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,039
arm that of course every TRNA has we

761
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,080
lose all of the activity so we believe

762
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,720
that these predictions are actually uh

763
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:29,279
potentially quite quite uh

764
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,919
correct so um if we assign functions to

765
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,120
enzymes that only are involved in pearls

766
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,399
then I think it would be useful but it

767
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,519
would still be sorry involved in rip

768
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,120
biosynthesis that would be useful but

769
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,120
still somewhat limited but fortunately

770
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,960
quite often the enzymes that we study

771
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,480
are also found in other context sequence

772
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,080
context other Gene clusters and so I

773
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,279
want to show you that in the context of

774
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,240
these pearls because we also find those

775
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,720
in polyketide synthes gene clusters and

776
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,120
also in non-ribosomal peptide synthetase

777
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,440
Gene clusters and so then the question

778
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,480
is what do they do in that context

779
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,559
sometimes they are attached to thio raay

780
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,000
domains sometimes they are part of a

781
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,279
complete module and sometimes they are

782
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,399
Standalone pearls and so uh we have

783
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,840
started to investigate these as well

784
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,080
then and this is the work of uauu a

785
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,760
current student in the in the lab so he

786
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,639
picked a gene cluster from stab brania

787
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,399
nenus it contains an nrps PKS a

788
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,279
thioesterase a dehydrogenase and then

789
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:34,880
the Pearl that we want to know what is

790
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,840
it doing in this

791
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,480
context and so he first took the enops

792
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,120
and the PKS uh expressed it in the holus

793
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,600
host streptomyces elbus and by doing

794
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,840
unbiased U metabolomics was able to show

795
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,679
that two new molecules are being made

796
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,760
compound two and compound one it turns

797
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,760
out that compound two turns into

798
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,799
compound one as you are doing the purif

799
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,600
if ation and the structural elucidation

800
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,720
and so compound two turns out to be a DI

801
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,480
orginal compound that has a Ura in the

802
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,720
middle and then an ethil Ketone at the

803
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,280
end and compound one is where this

804
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,879
nitrogen reacts with that Ketone to

805
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,040
cyclize it and turn it into this

806
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:24,919
structure so um then uh when we put in

807
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,879
the pearl also so coexpress the Pearl

808
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,280
together with the nrps and the PKS we we

809
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,760
again get two compounds and the

810
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,919
difference between what I just showed

811
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,440
you is that now two uh three Anin have

812
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,399
been added to the structure suggesting

813
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,399
that the Pearl is adding a three anine

814
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,720
and at first glance you might say well

815
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,079
you have an nrps this is already making

816
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,159
a peptide why would you need another uh

817
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,000
enzyme to make another Amite Bond and

818
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,560
the the the enel lies in the fact that

819
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,960
you have made a Ura so if you have made

820
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,839
a Ura you have essentially inverted the

821
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,440
directionality of the peptide uh and as

822
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,920
was already pointed out by Chris wallish

823
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,640
in in this publication when he studied

824
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,760
Ura formation in non- ribosomal peptide

825
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,240
synthesis uh this is his proposed

826
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,320
mechanism where the nitrogen can react

827
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,960
with bicarbonate and he shows that that

828
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,960
is the the source of the carbonal in the

829
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,680
Ura then you can draw a number of

830
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,760
different mechanisms I will just

831
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,599
describe one if this oxygen attacks that

832
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,000
carbonal there you would make an

833
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:33,040
anhydrite like structure and then you

834
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,480
could have an o2n uh uh carbonal shift

835
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,000
in order to give you the Ura structure

836
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,400
now if you think about this structure

837
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
this is uh this is activated to do more

838
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,760
chemistry at this

839
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,680
thioester but at this other

840
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,240
carboxilate with assembly line chemistry

841
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,040
you cannot really do anything with it

842
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,079
and that explains that when we look at

843
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,280
the dictionary of natural products and

844
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,680
we look at all Ura containing molecules

845
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,560
they all always have only a single amino

846
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,319
acid on one side of the Ura and then on

847
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,640
the other side in black is where further

848
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:11,480
elaboration by PKS or non-ribosomal

849
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,640
peptide synthesis has taken place and

850
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,520
that shows that you the the system

851
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,720
cannot do chemistry here apparently that

852
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,599
if a natural product can be made that is

853
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,400
beneficial to the organism by doing

854
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,000
further chemistry here a pearl is

855
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,560
attracted into the biosynthetic uh

856
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
pathway because now you can phosphorate

857
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,880
here we have shown that the 3nine comes

858
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,359
from 3L TRNA and so now you can also

859
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,319
extend in the other direction and so

860
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:43,119
very curious there's a few thousand

861
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,760
examples of this in the databases uh

862
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,240
what other structures are being made to

863
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,480
finish the biosynthesis of this

864
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:54,599
particular structure the polyte synthes

865
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,000
then adds a methyl melan unit to this

866
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,079
thioester here then the thioester cleave

867
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,280
this off the culation domain and then

868
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,680
the dehydrogenase domain that I haven't

869
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,839
really talked to you about thus far uh

870
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,040
it actually uh de desaturates this E

871
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,000
Group to this Alpha Beta unsaturated

872
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,200
Ketone and that's why we left it out of

873
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,680
our experiments initially we had put it

874
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,680
in but this is so reactive that it that

875
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,040
you constantly find other things that

876
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,920
have added here and that really made the

877
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,640
study much more difficult so we left

878
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
that out in the studies that I just just

879
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,880
showed

880
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,680
you so so far I hopefully have convinced

881
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,079
you that we can do genome mining for

882
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,960
rips and that I can also assign function

883
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,680
then to these hypothetical proteins that

884
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
these pearls add amino acids to both

885
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,680
ribosomal and non-ribosomal peptides and

886
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,680
that these M NEOS really are incredible

887
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,240
Catalyst that catalyze all kinds of

888
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,760
different oxidative reactions in the

889
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,880
last few minutes I would like to very

890
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,800
briefly touch upon some other things

891
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,680
that I normally talk about when I don't

892
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,280
talk about G mining for chemistry uh and

893
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,119
that is that this these biosynthetic

894
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,440
pathways are really versatile to do

895
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,800
bioengineering uh that you can do genome

896
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,839
mining uh in an automated fashion we've

897
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,960
done this together with my colleague qu

898
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:16,160
inzo who has these robots that drive up

899
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,160
and down do all of the the molecular

900
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,520
biology to refractor biosynthetic Gene

901
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,599
clusters into plasmas and we then put

902
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,800
into eoli to then produce the rips and I

903
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,400
want to start out with uh pointing out

904
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,960
that these enzymes are really great to

905
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,760
make libraries of polycyclic peptides

906
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,240
another popular new drug modality that

907
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,599
is being studied a lot in the

908
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,560
pharmaceutical companies so this is just

909
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,880
a summary slide showing all of the

910
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,520
different rips that to date uh have been

911
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,960
turned into libraries like 10 to the 6

912
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,480
to 10 to the8 variants of um of

913
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,079
polycyclic peptides because these

914
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,760
enzymes are very forgiving with respect

915
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,880
to the sequence of the core peptide so

916
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,359
we have done this for lenti peptides uh

917
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,720
we've done Fage display of these

918
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,880
compounds ye display we've done reverse

919
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,599
to hybrid experiments we've done epitope

920
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,280
graphing hero zugo and Yuki goo have

921
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:15,359
done mRNA display of these thop peptides

922
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:18,040
here at MIT Chris void has made

923
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,440
libraries of these reny peptides and

924
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,760
then selected them for binding to

925
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,040
certain Target proteins uh David Craig

926
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,280
in Australia has done a lot of epot

927
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,960
grafting on these plant cyclotides uh

928
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,680
and Doug Mitchell and Constantine sein

929
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,240
of have made libraries of lasso peptides

930
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,920
and then selected those for binding to

931
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,240
other proteins to disrupt protein

932
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,359
protein interactions so I think this is

933
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,240
a really tremendous space to make

934
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,680
libraries of cyclic peptides by using

935
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,760
enzymatic means which means you can

936
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,400
access very large

937
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,040
libraries um with respect to

938
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,560
bioengineering I wanted to point out

939
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,359
that if you if you do mRNA display or

940
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,920
Yeast display or Fage display typically

941
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,760
you then look for binding with a

942
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,480
purified protein that is maybe labeled

943
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,160
or maybe um fluorescently labeled and

944
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,000
you can find binders to all kinds of

945
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,040
different proteins but it would be

946
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,720
really nice if you could do this in the

947
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,520
context of human cells where there might

948
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,319
be protein protein complexes there might

949
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,400
be glycosilation happening and so can we

950
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,640
do this in in mamalian cells can we make

951
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,960
these bacterial and fungal proteins

952
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,440
sorry products

953
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,400
in mamalian cells and I've already

954
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,280
pointed out that these These syntheses

955
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,359
are incredibly portable because all you

956
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,440
need is a ribosome and 20 amino acids

957
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,680
and so indeed we have recently shown

958
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,920
that we can make these molecules in HEC

959
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,280
293 cells this is one example where this

960
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,720
compound here was made and you can see

961
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,800
from the fragmentation and also from the

962
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,359
stereo chemistry and the bioactivity we

963
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,720
are making the same molecule that in

964
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,079
this case an anus kers make um in its

965
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,400
own setting and in this case it's a

966
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,319
compound from a basilla strain and again

967
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,800
we get the exact same outcome uh but the

968
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:11,920
nice thing is because these are peptidic

969
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,640
you can send the products to where you

970
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,920
want to make it go for instance if we

971
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,160
want the cyclic peptide to go to the

972
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,880
nucleus we can add the nuclear

973
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,800
localization sequence um and in this uh

974
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,960
let's focus just on this here you can

975
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,319
see if we don't have the nuclear the

976
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,800
the nuclear localization sequence the

977
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,440
product is in the cytoplasm and if we

978
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,920
add the nuclear localization sequence

979
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,880
now the product goes to the nucleus

980
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,720
these were transient infe transections

981
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,760
and hence uh only two out of maybe 10

982
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,800
cells um are are transfected in this

983
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,960
case um we can of course increase the

984
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,480
transection efficiency or do selections

985
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,880
which we didn't do in this particular

986
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,640
case we can also send these products to

987
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,680
the cytoplasm sorry to the cytoplasmic

988
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,440
membrane by again adding a cytoplasmic

989
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,440
localization sequence we can send them

990
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,079
to the ER and when we then take them out

991
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,480
and see are they still fully processed

992
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:14,560
in all cases uh for this particular

993
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,680
example the ad dehydration and the three

994
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,160
cyclisation had still taken place so I

995
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,119
think there's uh there's potential here

996
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,640
to start looking for disrupting protein

997
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,640
protein interaction and doing it in the

998
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,800
native mamalian context rather than uh

999
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,680
doing it by mRNA display or Yeast

1000
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,480
display or some other uh initro

1001
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,400
method U and then to end since I

1002
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,920
mentioned I had originally in my title

1003
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,920
uh that I was going to tell you about

1004
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,520
genome mining for new natural products

1005
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,280
and I haven't really told you anything

1006
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,839
about that uh let me just uh point out

1007
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,400
two rips that come from our own

1008
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,000
microbiome and that are medically

1009
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,000
important um neither of these were

1010
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,960
discovered by us but both of them were

1011
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,960
made in Eola by and we have been

1012
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,119
collaborating with the people that have

1013
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,720
been working on it uh so this is a

1014
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,319
molecule that is called blon that was uh

1015
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,040
discovered by Eric Palmer and his

1016
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,559
co-workers now at the University of

1017
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,760
Chicago uh and he shows in this paper

1018
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,440
that if you have in your microbiome this

1019
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,960
organism blo a productor that makes this

1020
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,880
blaison that you are protected uh from

1021
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,680
um establishments of vomisin resistant

1022
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:29,920
and coxy infection so the these can no

1023
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,040
longer establish in the the gut um area

1024
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,559
uh and so we're working with Eric's lab

1025
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,119
to see if we can improve the activity of

1026
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,400
this molecule either as a therapeutic or

1027
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,640
as a

1028
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,200
prophylactic um now not all ribs that

1029
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,240
are made in our gut are good uh and one

1030
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,800
that is particularly bad is cyen this is

1031
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,400
made by pathogenic and Terra coccus

1032
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,040
falis it was reported first in the 1930s

1033
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,040
uh that this was leading to death uh and

1034
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,440
in

1035
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,240
2014 I think it was we determined the

1036
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,839
structure by making it in eoli and then

1037
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,920
determining the structure of the of the

1038
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,040
compound when we published that we were

1039
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,640
contacted by a lot of different Labs

1040
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,640
that ask can you send us some uh and one

1041
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:17,160
of those lab is uh burn Schnabel an MD

1042
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,040
at UCSD uh he sees infectious disease uh

1043
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,440
patient and when he asked for the

1044
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,480
material he said you know all the

1045
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,440
patients that I see um they they are

1046
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,760
going to die so these are patient

1047
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,240
numbers that are infected by anaus falis

1048
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,960
that can make

1049
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,559
cyto I should point out that this is a

1050
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,920
specific form of liver disease this is

1051
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:42,079
alcoholic uh hepatitis um and so there

1052
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,800
is no cure uh the people that come into

1053
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,720
his office will die and so after we send

1054
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,800
him the cyto lion he was able to show

1055
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,480
and that's all his work that it is

1056
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,680
indeed a cyon that is directly

1057
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,400
responsible for the destruction of the

1058
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,400
liver of these patients that uh

1059
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,119
eventually leads to their death so we're

1060
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,880
now working on inhibition of the

1061
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,800
biosynthesis of cyto lion to see if that

1062
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,079
can lead to a potential treatment so

1063
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,760
with that let me thank the people that

1064
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,880
have done the work you've seen their P

1065
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,760
their their their pictures uh let me

1066
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,880
tell you where they are now um Richard

1067
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,599
is at Merk Ching is down the road at

1068
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,640
brandise Michael is at Science magazine

1069
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,040
uh jeline and Shaker are still in my lab

1070
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,839
zengar is now at shangdong University

1071
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,160
Den as I mentioned is here at MIT in M

1072
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,200
Michael L's lab Sarah is at just evotech

1073
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,559
UA is still in my lab and we've had

1074
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,559
great collaborations with Doug

1075
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,559
Mitchell's lab I want to thank our

1076
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:42,720
funders I want to again thank ahed and

1077
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,400
and Liz for the invitation and you for

1078
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:51,400
your attention thank

1079
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,400
[Applause]

1080
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,480
you great thank you so the floor's open

1081
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,200
for questions and we're in a really big

1082
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,720
room so there's one mic over there um if

1083
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,520
people on that side want to get up and

1084
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,520
go and I can run it here or put

1085
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,480
it and I guess in the spirit of this

1086
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,480
series we'll ask for trainy questions

1087
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
first

1088
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,599
question in the

1089
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,839
Middle where are

1090
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:49,440
you do you guys ever look at induction

1091
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,880
of these biosynthetic Gene

1092
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,160
clusters yeah we do and it's that's a

1093
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,040
bit of a sore point so we often buy the

1094
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,480
organism that we get the cluster for

1095
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,720
most of the genes I didn't really say

1096
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,839
that but all of the genes were ecoli

1097
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:05,119
optimized they were synthetic they came

1098
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:08,319
from twist biosciences uh but then uh

1099
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,359
quite often when we have made it uh uh

1100
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,960
we don't know what the activity is of

1101
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:17,280
the molecule and we buy the organism uh

1102
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,319
and see if we can uh tweak it for um um

1103
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,119
uh production because maybe we didn't

1104
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:25,839
make what the natural organism make and

1105
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:29,880
in I would say 90% of the time we cannot

1106
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,880
find conditions where the the natural

1107
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,480
biosynthetic Gene cluster is turned on

1108
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,520
and we try all kinds of different things

1109
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,319
you know stressing adding antibiotics uh

1110
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,640
there's a lot of things that people have

1111
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,240
developed uh and this seems to be a

1112
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,520
general thing in the rip space so um

1113
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,800
I've heard urine peel at the ATR

1114
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,200
complain to me that these rips never

1115
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,280
actually are made and so it is indeed

1116
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,119
something that is uh a problem because

1117
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,440
we cannot always test clearly the the

1118
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,400
reactions that the these enzymes carry

1119
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,880
out are the reactions they carry out uh

1120
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,520
but what the the function is of the

1121
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,280
natural products we would like to know

1122
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,079
too uh and then uh if we have made the

1123
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,839
wrong compound or perhaps we're missing

1124
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,440
a step or perhaps not all of the

1125
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:15,440
reactions were uh performed the right

1126
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,319
way we would like to get the natural

1127
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,559
product and most of the times we don't

1128
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:19,559
see

1129
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:27,200
it go to the microphone over there yeah

1130
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,079
hi uh thank you for the great talk and

1131
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:39,280
about the mechanistic studies of the uh

1132
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,040
multiiron enzyme so like you said you're

1133
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,800
going to do some spectroscopic studies

1134
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,839
so are the intermediates like are the

1135
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,040
time scale are uh is it allowed to do

1136
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,960
like some frequence studies or yeah

1137
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,839
that's exactly how so in the study on

1138
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,920
the non-he monuclear iron dependent

1139
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,119
enzyme that I alluded to uh we did both

1140
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,520
flow studies in my lab and then also

1141
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,880
free scrench studies in mossow and epr

1142
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:08,119
in Marty and Carston's lab to uh stitch

1143
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,760
together uh seeing the the F real

1144
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:13,520
species and seeing that the decay of the

1145
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,680
fal species was both had both an isotope

1146
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,839
effect on the solvent and a substrate

1147
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,599
isotope effect uh and U I haven't showed

1148
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,559
you that enzyme but that can really only

1149
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,599
be explained if it is the O Bond uh that

1150
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,839
is being activated

1151
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,359
uh and so that's what we have been

1152
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:34,720
trying to do unfortunately not all

1153
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,640
enzymes are equally well suited for

1154
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,599
these type of experiments you need high

1155
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,480
concentrations some enzymes you cannot

1156
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,760
get high concentrations you need a

1157
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,359
certain window of the kinetics in order

1158
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,799
to be able to to to to trap them uh and

1159
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:51,720
so uh we are very hopeful in the first

1160
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,839
enzyme I showed you that breaks the

1161
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:59,160
alpha beta carbon Bond uh the second

1162
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:59,160
enzyme is not well behaved that I showed

1163
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:07,599
you thanks for the talk um how do you

1164
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,119
plan to inhibit the biosynthesis of the

1165
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,559
cycin is there one enzyme that is

1166
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:16,400
particularly easy to destroy uh all ribs

1167
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,480
need to have the leader peptide removed

1168
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,200
and without the leader peptide being

1169
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,319
removed they are

1170
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,400
inactive so that's one uh the enzyme

1171
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:27,160
that makes the Rings I didn't show you

1172
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,839
this at all but uh

1173
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,720
the uh it has an

1174
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,880
mamalian lipid kyese fold so my

1175
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,119
colleague sa n was able to get a crystal

1176
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,160
structure of these enzymes closest

1177
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,920
structural homologue is actually

1178
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,960
mtor and clearly lots and lots of

1179
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,760
compounds out there already that inhibit

1180
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:49,480
Emptor that we are seeing if we can

1181
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,720
repurpose them to inhibit this bacterial

1182
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,040
kise but these bacteria kise first

1183
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,640
phosphates and then eliminates the

1184
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,559
phosphate to put the double bond in to

1185
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,680
make a dehydro amino acid so it will be

1186
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,240
quite different we already know because

1187
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,040
we've published the the crystal

1188
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,280
structure the active site is different

1189
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,599
from say mtor so we we're not worried

1190
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,160
about you know treating uh patients to

1191
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,960
trying that cyon is no longer make and

1192
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,799
then at the same time inhibiting mtor

1193
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,640
and getting all kinds of other effects

1194
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:22,680
that we don't want but at the moment I

1195
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,960
don't have anything that that looks

1196
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,160
particularly exciting uh but that's what

1197
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,160
we're doing

1198
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:35,640
hey Wilfred um this is very interesting

1199
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:38,559
the Pearl enzymes so do you do you see

1200
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,480
any evidence for code on bias or do you

1201
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,559
think they accept all the different

1202
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,359
cognate trnas for yeah it's a great

1203
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,920
question so we have one that adds lucon

1204
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:53,760
and so in bacteria there's six different

1205
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:57,040
ISO except the trnas all of them work um

1206
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,520
and so uh we don't yeah we we clearly

1207
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,359
need to do more so if there is an

1208
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,400
anti-codon Loop recognition that tells

1209
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:07,760
you that it can only be to some of the

1210
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,119
nucleotides uh but yes we have not seen

1211
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,000
any when we first discovered them we

1212
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:15,240
thought that maybe this is related to

1213
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,359
secondary metabolism certain trnas are

1214
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:22,799
induced late uh in the in the life cycle

1215
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:25,400
of bacteria so far at least in vitro we

1216
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:26,960
don't see any preference for one or the

1217
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,720
other

1218
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,240
but they have to accept the TRNA for

1219
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,880
that amino acid if you give them a

1220
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,680
different TRNA they won't work correct

1221
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,680
yeah but with with hero with Huga we can

1222
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,599
put sure the wrong amino acid on the

1223
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,680
right TRNA and as does it still work and

1224
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,880
what if you put the right amino acid on

1225
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,839
the wrong TRNA but those those studies

1226
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,119
are ongoing so I can't really tell you

1227
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,040
yet I like your orange t-shirts yeah

1228
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,559
they do double duty it's the color of

1229
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,119
illino and it's the color of the

1230
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,960
Netherlands and so we

1231
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,880
from Total Football to Total science

1232
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,760
right there you go I just want a follow

1233
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:08,040
to that like maybe you already answer

1234
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:11,040
this but I was curious if there's a TRNA

1235
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:14,599
abundance issue like are they using

1236
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:18,280
pretty abundant tras in the particular

1237
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:20,680
organism or that kind of gets to how

1238
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,200
important and how specific are these

1239
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,920
natural products yeah yeah it's it's a

1240
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,160
it's a great question the first one that

1241
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,040
we discovered is actually one that used

1242
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,359
glutamil TRNA I didn't talk about that

1243
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:36,280
and that comes from a lactic acid

1244
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:39,680
bacterium lactic coccus uh and if you uh

1245
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,480
uh look at what are the most prevalent

1246
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,280
uh um small molecules in eoli it is

1247
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,920
glutamate so we thought like yay and

1248
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,720
then we talked to someone who studies

1249
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,280
lactococcus lactus and it's not

1250
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,480
glutamate so not yay and so it it

1251
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,880
doesn't seem to be correlated with the

1252
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,440
the the the amount of uh Amino ail TRNA

1253
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,040
there is of course for for the great

1254
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,359
majority of the organisms where these

1255
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,880
clusters come from we actually don't

1256
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:08,520
know there's no metabolomics that has

1257
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,680
been done that we know what the relative

1258
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,400
amounts are of the different metabolites

1259
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,520
but for the one that we do know it

1260
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,240
didn't

1261
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:20,040
correlate so we don't know we don't know

1262
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,440
why um um yeah and how this evolved and

1263
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,480
we can also not predict we had hoped

1264
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,920
that the the alphafold structure would

1265
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,040
allow us to predict before we do the

1266
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,000
experiment because that would make it

1267
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,920
much easier to find the other 12 that I

1268
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,880
want to find uh and so far that has not

1269
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,400
worked out so Alpha fold is good but not

1270
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,960
not perfect and it cannot predict at the

1271
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,559
moment the substrate selectivity for the

1272
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,559
amino

1273
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,280
T also some one up there

1274
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,839
thank you for the great talk uh I had

1275
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,880
another question about the Pearl enzymes

1276
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:12,680
uh is there something um about the

1277
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:16,200
structure that limits the enzyme from uh

1278
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:19,160
acting on proteins with long CA terminal

1279
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,760
Tails or does it have to be just rips

1280
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,599
and uh you know other smaller peptides

1281
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,359
and I'm curious if uh there have been

1282
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,000
proteins with that modification of

1283
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:31,839
observed yeah it's a great question so

1284
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,920
uh as far as we uh know currently and we

1285
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,760
haven't studied all of the eight that we

1286
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,640
uh the one that we have studied most

1287
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,960
puts on a tryptophan uh it is uh quite

1288
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,000
forgiving with respect to the sequence

1289
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,160
of the peptide uh which surprised us to

1290
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,960
be honest uh so we don't understand why

1291
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,240
it's not adding tryptophan to a lot of

1292
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,599
different things there are certain amino

1293
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,920
acids that needs to be spaced a certain

1294
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:58,880
distance from the C terminus and you

1295
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,440
need to have those otherwise it doesn't

1296
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,319
work but we've taken the last I think I

1297
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,520
think it was 12 amino acids uh and put

1298
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,160
it on a protein put it on MVP put it on

1299
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,319
egfp uh and then the enzyme does add

1300
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,280
tryptophan to the protein so it is a tag

1301
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,960
that allows you but then you add an

1302
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:22,839
amino acid that of course you could have

1303
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,000
also encoded on the on the uh TRNA uh

1304
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:28,640
sorry on the on the DNA but we are very

1305
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,599
interested in looking at unnatural TR

1306
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,760
Amino isolated trnas that have been used

1307
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,960
for the codone suppression type of

1308
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,799
technology and see if we can tease our

1309
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,720
enzymes starting to put non-natural

1310
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:43,240
amino acids onto proteins but we haven't

1311
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,240
yet done

1312
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:51,359
that if I can add to that um I think at

1313
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,200
least in UK carots the the identity of

1314
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:56,280
the C Terminus sometimes determines the

1315
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,680
stability of the protein so this could

1316
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,599
could be a really neat tool to tune the

1317
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,920
stability of prot that's a great idea

1318
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:04,200
yeah I hadn't thought of that but yes

1319
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,200
you're

1320
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,079
right

1321
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,440
Laura um I was gonna just ask another

1322
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:13,240
mechanistic question so in the I know

1323
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,480
they're

1324
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:22,119
not I'm call

1325
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:24,559
mever so those enzymes um you propos for

1326
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:26,960
one of them this interesting mechanism

1327
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,160
where you make that kind of radical

1328
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,559
later as opposed to just abstracting

1329
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,559
that position which you show doesn't

1330
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:39,079
happen and I just wondered if you had

1331
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:41,799
any calculations or anything like that

1332
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:46,400
that might provide insight into why

1333
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:49,280
those other steps Happ yeah radal yeah

1334
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,559
we we have we have not um to be honest

1335
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,599
we we we we made that Alpha dutter uh

1336
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,039
position because we thought that's where

1337
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,799
the abstraction

1338
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:02,079
yes also because then I could draw

1339
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:03,920
making an EP sulfide and opening it up

1340
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,400
move the sulfur to the alpha carbon so

1341
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,240
that was our preferred mechanism Bas

1342
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,760
your other mechanism that's kind of what

1343
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,359
I thought you yeah so we have so so uh

1344
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,319
we have a crystal structure but we don't

1345
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:17,960
have a co- crystal structure of that

1346
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,760
enzyme so the co- crystal structure I

1347
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,760
showed you was for Amy and way Chang's

1348
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,559
enzyme uh and so we don't uh we haven't

1349
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:31,039
done any calculations um but yes we

1350
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:33,839
should yeah probably because um we

1351
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:36,000
actually I cannot even tell you what the

1352
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,559
calculated activation energies are of

1353
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,960
any of these steps and maybe some of

1354
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:41,520
them are ridiculously high so it it's

1355
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,079
something that yeah a lot of work we

1356
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,079
still need to

1357
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:52,640
do okay with that let's thank Wolford

1358
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:52,640
for terrific seminar
