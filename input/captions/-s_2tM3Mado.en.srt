1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,639
Hi everyone. Good morning. I am uh

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:14,000
Philip Kolaris. I'm the COO and CFO of

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,400
Fab Zero. Uh we are using applied AI to

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,960
solve physical logistics problems

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,519
specifically to move boxes from point A

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:27,840
to point B. This is our team David MB

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,240
former MIT alum uh 2014

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,040
and Vadim Takenov. He's the CTO. He's

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,559
based out of Italy.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,680
What is the problem here? So the problem

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,879
is nobody wants to be carrying 10 10

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,760
kilo boxes for eight hours a day for

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,079
five days a week and it's creating a

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,559
massive labor shortage on the market.

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,120
One of our customers has a statistics

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,120
that says that 400%

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,680
is labor turnover for them. So they're

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,399
constantly hiring people uh throughout

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,840
the whole year. We think that we

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
estimate that there's about a million

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,119
warehouses globally and 80% have no

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,520
automation whatsoever.

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,720
This this this is a market that is prime

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,799
for automation and robotics. The problem

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,920
is it's it's very hard because of the

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,000
random randomization of the boxes.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
Whenever you open a container, you're

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,960
either going to get a very well stacked

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
and 99% density in a container or you're

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,680
gonna get something like this picture

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,320
here. It's completely not efficient

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
boxes on the floor. So the the the the

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,119
AI needs to look at this. We need to use

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,159
integrate optics orchestration with the

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,520
robots to to to figure out what's the

36
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,520
most efficient way of picking these

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
boxes.

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
Now, why are we different? Well, we're

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
different because first of all, we are a

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,920
software company first. We are hardware

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,880
agnostic. We are very fluid. What we do

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
is we we use our software to enable the

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,079
hardware. We can redesign the

44
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,719
configuration of the hardware any way to

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,039
meet the customer's demands. So, if you

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,319
have a customer that has a thousand

47
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,080
warehouses, they're not going to

48
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,959
retrofit just for our solution. What

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
we're going to do is we're going to

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,160
design we're going to make changes to

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,480
our design to fit their needs and that's

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,720
that's going to enable a lot of scaling

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,720
very fast

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,239
because we have the software and we can

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
design multiple different solutions. We

56
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,720
can tackle many different problems on

57
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
the warehouse. We are right now looking

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
at unloading,

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,599
sorting and palletizing stacking boxes

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,920
up. This is a this is an installed

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,400
solution we have at our customer today.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,040
With the software it and the vision that

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,800
we have, it enables other things such as

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,920
loading to a container, storing and uh

65
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,040
and also uh looking at integrity of the

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,040
containers for inventory management.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
So you guys got to bear with me one

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,519
second because I'm not as technical

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,640
here. Uh so so the our tech stack is we

70
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,640
have the simulation our simo it's

71
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
realistic simulation to train the AI

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,360
model and test systems before

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,640
deployment. Percept handles segmentation

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,879
models and drives decision making to to

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,120
find the most efficient pick sequence.

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
Robboto creates ARM orchestration that

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
allows for hardware agnostic operations

78
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,480
and narrow manages the machine learning

79
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,480
and reinforcement training.

80
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,959
The left side is uh is at a customer's

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,040
side. The right side is the simulation.

82
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,440
The if you see we're we're very unique

83
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,760
on our design because we have two arms

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,319
and we are compared to the competition

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,959
with only one arm. This enables us to

86
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,879
pick boxes at a faster rate and also

87
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,200
coordinate the two arms to pick bigger

88
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,400
sized boxes. Now a human is picking on

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,400
average an hour 400 boxes. to make this

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,799
solution work, we need to be twice as

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,120
that and we're currently hitting two and

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,120
a half times.

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
We've uh we've engaged with um three

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
customers. Either we're work installing

95
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,600
systems right now, we have a working

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,160
system or we're talking through putting

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,040
a proof of concept in. Every customer

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
has its unique needs. We have a we have

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,720
the I think it's the third biggest

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,199
importer of goods. It's a it's this B2C

101
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,120
retailer. They uh they really needed a

102
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,400
solution that would unload from from the

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,040
containers, sort and stack the boxes for

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
storage. We developed a three module

105
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,800
system that does that. The second the

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,560
second uh customer is a big parcel ship

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,160
shipper and uh they they needed

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
something that would fit into their

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
brownfield, something would be installed

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
and they could scale it up. We're in the

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,759
moment we finished the designs. for

112
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,320
installing it at one of their test

113
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,960
sites. The third one is a is a big

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,280
online retailer that has needs for

115
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,919
multiple different things. Uh aircraft,

116
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,240
we we have a bid out for aircraft

117
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,320
unloading as well as loading and

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
unloading of of crates and sorting

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,840
boxes.

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,080
Uh and and finally, partnerships wise,

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,320
we're we're open to meet everybody. We

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,560
we'd love to meet you. Uh we have a

123
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
booth on the on the other room. Uh we're

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,919
looking at scale. We're we're a global

125
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,880
company. We need to be we know that

126
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,840
scale is is the way to go and we love to

127
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,840
get to know you guys.
