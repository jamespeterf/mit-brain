1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
okay getting complicated on it okay clip

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,899
it to the belt on the side right just

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,340
clip it right down okay good now you

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,559
have an on/off switch it'll be like you

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,450
put it on I don't touch the damn thing

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,790
everybody just talked with dr. Kovac I

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,619
don't like electronic gauges anymore I'm

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,940
just gonna move this to here all right

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,189
you know what we've done here is we've

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,570
lit an area at the podium we're going to

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,890
get a nice shot if you stay in that air

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,949
do you like to roam around a lot when

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,630
you're talking oh I'll talk right on the

14
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,890
phone is going to be for our tape that

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,810
microphone the air is going to see the

16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,309
PA system in the house good we have your

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,649
tongue wonderful I hope it all working

18
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,680
good luck if it works you're the only

19
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:47,100
guy where I speak with works they

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:50,579
usually fit hello alright let me say

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:01:11,430
hello somehow those vocal like senior

all of the relevant information business

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,159
facts and things in this folder which I

27
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,280
believe has been passed out for everyone

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,020
I think rather than take any more time

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:47,459
on the quiet and let you hear the person

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:50,490
as you came here to here ladies and

31
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:53,399
gentlemen let me congratulate you first

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,349
to have in a boss who give the finest

33
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,610
introduction I've ever had and I've been

34
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,970
speaking for many years

35
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:05,009
thank you very much for being so brief

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:07,979
now you read as your chairman said this

37
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,039
fine description of mine here and I

38
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,440
would like to brag on one point what is

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,299
not contained is that I clear the goal

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,269
go to the National Aviation Hall of Fame

41
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:21,239
which is a pretty rare thing because I

42
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,549
saw bono Hine spoke here two years old

43
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,970
two speeches ago and he did not get it

44
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:30,709
and that's the only sense okay I'm glad

45
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:36,810
that to see so many of you interested in

46
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:39,269
a different type of engineering so in

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,239
order not to screw up completely with my

48
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,920
what I really want to teach you what I

49
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,980
want to tell you so that you learn

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,090
something from that speech I will begin

51
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:54,180
in front in Germany I was born there

52
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:58,019
which you saw under the book and before

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,290
you can be admitted or could be admitted

54
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,799
I don't know what it is now into an

55
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,880
engineering school in Germany you had

56
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,260
was mandatory to spend not two years but

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,220
three years of an apprenticeship

58
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,810
apprenticeship without pay now I

59
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,079
reintroduced and I will jump back and

60
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,400
forth several times in my talk today I

61
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,100
reintroduced in general ethic once I got

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,320
in charge over thousands of people and

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,600
ran a whole jet engine business

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,380
I reintroduce the apprentice system

65
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,300
because I felt it was mandatory and you

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,030
will hear later as we go along on my

67
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:43,260
background what I learned I think it's

68
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,660
mandatory that you students young men

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,870
going to college before going to college

70
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,180
before going to MIT get your hands dirty

71
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,910
I get a fail for bolts nuts tools on

72
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,180
everything you must get a pupil now let

73
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:04,290
me ask you a question first how many of

74
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,209
you have taken have worked on your car

75
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,310
I assume each of you as a car not a

76
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,640
grandpa how just raised yet how many of

77
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,570
you okay good how many have gone down

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,430
depose and spark looks oh boy

79
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,660
well that's better as I am surprised by

80
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,690
that I'm very glad to hear that

81
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,740
because I spoke in Cal Tech and in some

82
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:28,110
other places on the west coast where a

83
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,740
lot of boys said yes we're working on

84
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,530
our cars

85
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,100
howdy Pippi galoot below spark plugs

86
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:40,100
there was just a small number when I was

87
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:45,450
you age at that time in Germany one

88
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:47,970
person had a car out of 53 people maybe

89
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,400
very few cause but we were stories about

90
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,419
America that all American kids have

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,800
model a Ford's that was that age and

92
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,810
that they just turned a cow over

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,370
sideways and take the oil pan off or

94
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,290
start work on the bearings and crank

95
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,870
shafts and piston rings and valves and

96
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,790
and all about it and we were very

97
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,910
jealous of the American kids who had

98
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,070
this opportunity now today I don't think

99
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,220
many of you have looked in the oil pan

100
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:18,770
and take your open up your car and so on

101
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:22,560
anyhow you had to be an apprentice and

102
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:25,110
actually the book is correctly or your

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,419
your prospect here that two years were

104
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,490
mandatory but three years was

105
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,169
practically mandatory because up to

106
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,290
three years till you became a journeyman

107
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:37,289
in Germany you were not permitted to

108
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,210
work without supervision on any call

109
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,390
whether it breaks our steering range of

110
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,480
what it is unless you are

111
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:46,430
certified journeyman the journeyman is a

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,010
guy who had bloody fingernails some

113
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,610
bloody knuckles and everything busted

114
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:56,930
and had a good taste of what goes what

115
00:05:52,610 --> 00:06:00,890
doesn't go I went to school I graduated

116
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,860
from a very small school total 650

117
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,840
students total capacity the oldest in

118
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,820
Germany but mr. Hank Oh of painkiller

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,240
cough mr. juncos of Junkers aircraft

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:14,750
very many famous people and successful

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,930
people graduated from that school now

122
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,690
here comes one little lesson the fact

123
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,090
that you are an MIT graduate or going to

124
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,280
be I think is wonderful and you will

125
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,210
have no trouble getting public of finest

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,180
jobs anywhere what you do with them is

127
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:35,300
another matter and I don't know if you

128
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,190
have a system of asking people keeping

129
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,710
record often what happens 10 years later

130
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,300
and I have a questionnaire sent to them

131
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,520
and they old address and say what

132
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,950
happened do you in ten years after you

133
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,660
graduated and then you can find out

134
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,740
whether all the things you're being

135
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:57,620
taught are really useful and practical

136
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:59,300
and necessary well I graduated and just

137
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,240
before graduation rate on a bulletin

138
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,630
board a little notice saying that twelve

139
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,590
young engineers are wanted in China

140
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,780
nationalist China that time was no

141
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,320
common as China but it was was up in the

142
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:16,160
hills Nash was China to maintain German

143
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,310
military equipment that was 1938 the end

144
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,330
of 38 to go over there and 39 now you

145
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:26,210
may wonder if your history is any good

146
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,360
and you elderly gentlemen I'm sure

147
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,600
remember very well the Hitler Hirohito

148
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,490
Mussolini axis party that while Hitler

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:40,940
was officially an ally of the Japanese

150
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:43,820
they love the Chinese Germany in China

151
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,490
were allies in World War one in ship

152
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,250
Germany shipped secretly the latest war

153
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,080
equipment to nationalist China to fight

154
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,169
the Japanese now that you never read

155
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,759
before anyone here heard it before

156
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:02,360
okay so that was a thing I wound up in

157
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:06,860
Hong Kong and it was an exciting trip to

158
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:11,229
Hong Kong because in 1939 there was a

159
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:15,020
once-a-week flight from Europe to China

160
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:17,479
one flight week took 8 days in the same

161
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,779
plane fully loaded

162
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,620
four crew members pilot copilot engineer

163
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:27,849
navigator and 12 passengers that's all

164
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:31,310
ahead big tri-motor French devotee

165
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:34,099
flying every 2 and 1/2 hours where to

166
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,110
make a landing in another country over

167
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,909
North Africa I've never seen a camel

168
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,409
before you Americans have seen us in

169
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,409
television all this brings you up to

170
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,480
date but in those days 1939 I never seen

171
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,699
a camel I never seen a black person I've

172
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,190
never seen a North African and we went

173
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:52,550
along down to Egypt when Egypt Iraq and

174
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,560
or Lebanon Lebanon in Baghdad and back

175
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,519
that the cross Indian cause injured in

176
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,019
Thailand and Burma and Indochina which

177
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,019
was French of those days and finally

178
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:07,100
Hong Kong and I reported in Hong Kong to

179
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:10,220
that Chinese outfit which was a secret

180
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,100
outfit to gather us young engineers and

181
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,160
take us into the interior of China now

182
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,110
how many of you have been to Hong Kong

183
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,089
oK you've seen Hong Kong skyscrapers

184
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,750
full of people four five six million

185
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,089

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,550
150,000 people in Hong Kong of whoo

187
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,709
25,000 the British troops it was a very

188
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,750
small town with one high-rise building

189
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,899
of 20 storeys today it's the skyscraper

190
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,329
one next to the other one this

191
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:40,420
organization the chinese nationalist

192
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:43,600
organization which was supposed to

193
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:47,990
receive us and take us into the interior

194
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,060
had disappeared a few days before per

195
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,949
request of the japanese who have found

196
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,290
out that they're Germans on a way to

197
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:56,870
China to help the Chinese against them

198
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,300
they put the pressure on the British the

199
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,070
British caved in through the Chinese out

200
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,800
and here I was sitting there together

201
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,600
with some associates and a finest hotel

202
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,579
was absolutely no money which was

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,980
supposed to be paid now I could tell you

204
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,410
as

205
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:15,690
and our about that but this is not as

206
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,490
the MIT subject puts it I went into the

207
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,850
interior first the wall started and I

208
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:24,000
became personable of the British and for

209
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:26,520
a total of 102 Germans most of them were

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,750
residents in Hong Kong representing

211
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,900
mercedes-benz like our cameras various

212
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,780
steam engines and industrial concerns we

213
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:40,080
were all interned in Hong Kong and in

214
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,800
1940 where Germany made a big push

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,620
after having beaten Poland in 1939 on

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,090
France Belgium Holland Denmark and you

217
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:54,000
may recall that you gentlemen in June of

218
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:57,480
1940 things got very tough on our camp

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,100
and we were given 48 hours to quote get

220
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:05,250
the hell out of here or be interned in

221
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,320
Colombo in salon in India because up to

222
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,510
that time we were still being treated a

223
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,310
little kind of gentlemen because the

224
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,190
Chinese are those they look through the

225
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,680
barbed wire inside they couldn't see one

226
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,510
white man mistreating the other white

227
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,100
man that's whether those days in China a

228
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:25,260
very impossible thing well by absolute

229
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,740
coincidence and I want to make us much

230
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,020

231
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,850

245
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,160

looked at that soldier and said what's

255
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,990

256
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:32,400

Android and I learned a lot of lessons

314
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,340
which you should learn it was a bomber

315
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,020
Road you heard about the Burma Road

316
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,470
wasn't finished yet had be bolted

317
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,740
between China kun Ming and Western Union

318
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:09,550
of lower lower corner of China and Burma

319
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,100
the only communication which would be

320
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,010
there except one railroad line from

321
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,480
Indochina and the danger was already

322
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,940
that time the Japanese would occupy

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,980
Indochina and the bike stopped the road

324
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,410
China would be cut off because a

325
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,170
homologous I in between the Burma Road

326
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:29,860
goes in between a malaria my Himalayan

327
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:33,010
mountains to Burma so this man in charge

328
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,230
had to be a German at the French Renault

329
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,560
diesel immediately said would you like

330
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:42,490
to take a convoy down the Burma Road we

331
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,960
bring tungsten and other valuable

332
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,300
material which I didn't have the United

334
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,760
ammunition a gasoline up the Burma Road

335
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,420
the trucks are four-cylinder diesel

336
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,880
trucks and they were so overloaded that

337
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,040
the springs a set of leaf springs in a

338
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,900
car we're completely flat on the wooden

339
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,120
blocks were put between the chassis and

340
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,200
the axle because it's bringing it up so

341
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,380
you know effect anymore

342
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,870
it was just flattened out well the

343
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,180
territory like kun Ming where we start a

344
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,040
6,000 feet high and from there be

345
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,300
climbed of eight eight nine thousand

346
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,580
feet and then went down again driving a

347
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,890
convoy leading a convoy all Chinese and

348
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,840
their Chinese drivers Chinese co-drivers

349
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,760
the first thing we did we knocked the

350
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,560
doors out we took the doors I took the

351
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,120
windows out so that you could jump out

352
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,710
in case you had a job are now I don't

353
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,230
want to give you a long story on a ball

354
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:39,510
road but I want to tell you that at one

355
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:42,160
point we had a bearing problem one

356
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,100
connecting rod start hammering away in

357
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,320
inside an engine and I crawled

358
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,960
underneath it all convoy stop that was

359
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,150
so now no other convoy could pass there

360
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,090
was no other corner we had only one coin

361
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:58,630
by dawn and one coin by going up took

362
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,180
your pen off looked at it and I saw the

363
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,370
metal or remote down there and it was a

364
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,780
bearing rattling around in there now

365
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,400
where the heck you get the bearing you

366
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,089
wouldn't even get a bearing in United

367
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,850
States

368
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,690
I wonder they could get it in France

369
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,329
certainly not on the Burma Road

370
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,860
somewhere in the middle of knowing what

371
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,040
to do

372
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,050
Chinese spy privateer he said mister he

373
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,990
spoke a little tiny little English and I

374
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,300
spoke a little Chinese by that time

375
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:30,370
here's my hat say we're going to do the

376
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:32,590
hat he cut it we cut a strip of felt and

377
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,910
wrapped it around for his suggestion

378
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,010
aren't the bearing put the bank together

379
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,130
that thing was running up and down a

380
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:42,010
Burma Road with that hat in there okay

381
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,980
here you cheap engineers and all experts

382
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,220
on everything you'll see that some very

383
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,410
good idea of an uneducated Chinese boy

384
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,230
who does had a good fearful situation

385
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:56,020
could cut the hat pull around and up

386
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,060
went the next problem ahead was a

387
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,670
village was up on top of one of the high

388
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:04,930
points and we stopped the overnight to

389
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:06,250
eat to sleep on a bamboo cot and next

390
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,400
morning I couldn't start the Angels

391
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,260
altitude was too high so what to do now

392
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,730
you learn another thing you begin to

393
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,470
learn all kind of things without go to

394
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,750
MIT or German engineering school or

395
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,180
somewhere I learned from then on one

396
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,300
engine we got started luckily who then

397
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,460
pulled every truck till it goes down and

398
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,600
then let it roll down gain speed and

399
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,670
start the engine

400
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,290
alright so this is my experience on the

401
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,560
Boomer wound I could tell you a lot more

402
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,530
of what's going on there then came the

403
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,960
day when my neighbor and those days we

404
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,270
didn't live in a Chinese town we had

405
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,240
foreigners had to live outside in a very

406
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:46,480
modern little village in Kunming my

407
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,770
neighbor was smoked and he grabbed me

408
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,140
morning on December the 8th 1941 I was

409
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,320
just going over to a place where I had

410
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,090
started a garage of my own the Chinese

411
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,909
had never seen a white man

412
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,159
rarely work in a garage now they are

413
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:05,409
cause they only the governor had a car

414
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,989
his wife at a car his concubines he had

415
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:10,059
three of them had cause the police chief

416
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:11,919
Etta called the military and a couple

417
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,899
bankers and to foreign embassies

418
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,549
embassies they all came to duman's

419
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,960
karachi got bigger they are going to

420
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,330
hired one man another man another man

421
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,129
finally i had two dozen men and i

422
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,690
photographs of it and i visited that

423
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:25,090
garage a couple months a couple years

424
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,769
ago we were in china it is still there

425
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,190
and there now you repair cause what they

426
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,700
do

427
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,919
we needed a spring leaf another springs

428
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,479
one big one at a little shorter one sort

429
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,659
of a loop sort of one that's a set of

430
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:42,940
Springs for the british ambassador

431
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:47,320
we couldn't get a spring leaf but we had

432
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:52,379
a round iron rod long rod and I had a

433
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:55,629
Chinese tall six-foot-something

434
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:56,169
blacksmith who had a little fight foot

435
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:59,859
something

436
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:01,599
wife take busted little baby all their

437
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,039
nursing right along aligned as well all

438
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,830
standard down there standard procedure

439
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,590
and she operated a hand pump to get the

440
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,109
fire going charcoal fire and a fifty

441
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,409
gasoline barrel hazard thing heated and

442
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:17,649
he took that rod and he did that rod

443
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:19,570
justice section about a foot of it and I

444
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,729
said okay now and she took the baby

445
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,519
dumped it down in the corner grab the

446
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:26,499
sledgehammer and with a round swing with

447
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,149
a round swing and I mean around swing

448
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,470
was prohibited in Germany I don't know

449
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:31,749
how it is here in America I didn't even

450
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,119
know all it's an England but there was a

451
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:36,609
round swing was dangerous the hammer

452
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:40,179
could fly away down there but she swung

453
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:42,580
and they cam it piece by piece heat it

454
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,909
again he did it again he'd again another

455
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,489
section a leaf out of it curled the eyes

456
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:51,489
and we had to spring except it wasn't

457
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:53,529
hot how we went on hard the spring we

458
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:55,479
had no idea what the degree of hardness

459
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:57,580
should be or what it should be but we've

460
00:20:55,479 --> 00:21:00,429
all told to do our little business in

461
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,970
this trough and the trough was for was

462
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:06,700
urine the guy he to the whole spring and

463
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:10,359
then dumped it in a little bit a little

464
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,489
more beam on little wall and dumped the

465
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,929
whole thing is it okay

466
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:14,740
believe it or not that spring was

467
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,140
running

468
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,510
to earth when I was including until I

469
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,870
joined apply tires it was running all

470
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,540
right

471
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,240
the many many examples I can give you

472
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,700
how you can help yourself as some

473
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,500
ingenuity with some feel for the

474
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,540
situation a man had no theory no

475
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,300
theoretical knowledge the vendor said he

476
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:39,340
just did it ok I joined the Flying

477
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:43,750
Tigers p40 Curtis corners now p-40s when

478
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:48,309
a 1937 plane opposition was Japanese

479
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:51,460
zero we had a lot of bombers overhead we

480
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:54,370
had zeros overhead who had bombed before

481
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,470
the flight Tigers arrived the city and

482
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,550
electric works and whatever we had there

483
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:03,970
that tried to hit my garage to well here

484
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,380
was the first example of me learning

485
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,240
American technique

486
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,890
I got a handbook of an Ellison engine

487
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,350
1,050 horsepower driving a three-bladed

488
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,809
propeller and the Curtis ride wasn't all

489
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:20,350
plane but other solid clean armored

490
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,120
plating self-sealing fuel tanks - 30

491
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,880
caliber machine guns firing through the

492
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,610
propeller hub for 50 calibers in the

493
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,260
wings so an initial plane we had they

494
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:33,730
were a hundred oven shipped to China now

495
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,970
I tell you one thing which you won't

496
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,710
believe and you never heard fulfilled

497
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:42,190
did you know that the United States had

498
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,030
planned a preemptive strike on Japan

499
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,770
prior to Bravo all right

500
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,990
Croesus my wife's name down there I have

501
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,570
that folder the this page of the

502
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,820
newspaper in a book which is a new book

503
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:58,059
as odd which gives the fact that the

504
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,660
United States knowing the Japanese would

505
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:04,059
have to attack the United States because

506
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,070
they were all completely they had normal

507
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,840
fuel we boycotted numbers iron we

508
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,910
boycott understeer we did many things

509
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,380
from we caused them to do it they were

510
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,410
power was done in anyway I don't want to

511
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,720
defend a Japanese one dog bit but we

512
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,420
know an attack was going to come not

513
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,340
necessarily all the way down a why we

514
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,830
thought Guam or Kwajalein or some of

515
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,630
these places would get hit not all the

516
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,559
way get an aircraft carrier down in a

517
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,169
long range

518
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,259
getting Japanese planes

519
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:34,659
Hawaii we had planned several months

520
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,820
earlier and to Flying Tigers with us

521
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,769
fighter squadrons three of them which

522
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,269
were sent over already in a dissipation

523
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:42,999
of three more squadrons of bomber

524
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:45,039
squadrons who were stuck in Australia

525
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:48,609
for some red tape reason when the war

526
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:52,809
started so the United States had planned

527
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:55,779
to hit Japan before Japan could hit us

528
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:57,399
in Hawaii and that is a fact you look at

529
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,899
if you don't believe it well I hope you

530
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:00,729
get the book down there my wife up there

531
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:03,159
later has the name of the book down they

532
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:05,289
would say just came out and let's handle

533
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:09,940
it huh

534
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:12,929
she's sleeping okay all right here we

535
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:17,949
here we go here we where p-40s

536
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:20,019
with a V engine 12 solos spark plugs

537
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:22,929
inside spark plug from both sides on the

538
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:24,899
bank spark plugs on the outside pretty

539
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:28,209
good machines very heavy

540
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:33,099
the whole plane weight 8,000 pounds had

541
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:35,259
2,000 horsepower to drive it and we have

542
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:36,579
a propeller governor I don't know if you

543
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,940
know it of appellate governor's a

544
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:43,119
propeller has not only blades but they

545
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,669
rotate not only this way of course but

546
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,729
they rotate on takeoff a different angle

547
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:50,619
and when they cruise or when they climb

548
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:53,379
so they're just a few degrees of

549
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:55,449
rotation so a governor the governor is

550
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:58,440
the gadget which is held on by four nuts

551
00:24:55,449 --> 00:25:02,229
against four studs built into the V and

552
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,629
I have lesson one for you here when you

553
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:07,779
design something but you think is

554
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:10,389
practical later you better think of how

555
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,849
it's going to be used and talk to people

556
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:14,259
who use it and not just sit at an

557
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:17,259
air-conditioned office as you're going

558
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:19,119
to have you understand and have it

559
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,429
thinking of a nice engine hanging on the

560
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,169
crane and worried maybe even going to

561
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:25,979
working on that engine or looking at

562
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:28,449
that engine this engine is hot as hell

563
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:31,269
when it comes back from the mission and

564
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:33,609
the pilot says hey I got a propeller

565
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:35,499
governor problem quickly fix it

566
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:36,879
they're Japs on the way already 20

567
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:39,190
minutes following us later you better

568
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:41,200
get in there take four nuts loose get a

569
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,070
new governor on quickly put it together

570
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,050
get that

571
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:48,120
plane ready to fly again or the subject

572
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:51,100
beam bomb or being straight no idea what

573
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,750
practicality meant they installed that

574
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,670
nice governor when it's nice and cool

575
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,170
and good hand light and skiing could be

576
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,180
little light here and little more

577
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,800
business this way you can headed an

578
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,890
airplane in Seoul sitting on a military

579
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,270
runway there in China somewhere and it

580
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:09,670
was useless I'll tell you another one

581
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:12,880
which is the same style the p40 which is

582
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:14,560
that airplay talked about head of course

583
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,870
a tail wheel like all these planes in

584
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,300
those days had meant no nearly all the

585
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,700
plates so everybody took off a gain

586
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,430
speed as a game speed had lifted its

587
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,930
tail toll as horizontal gain more speed

588
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,060
till they had a ninety five hundred

589
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:32,140
miles now and then it could lift up and

590
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:35,080
take off they had a lot of gravel in

591
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:37,270
China in sand because we had no asphalt

592
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,000
runways there was no asphalt that didn't

593
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,790
exist in China all the runways that we

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,820
built was ten thousand women and I'm not

595
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:48,310
exaggerating over ten thousand chopping

596
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,440
away on stones make them smaller make

597
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,540
them smaller and have a real fine layer

598
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,200
on top and then they were two hundred

599
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:58,200
men on a big V pulling a stone roll over

600
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,340
the runway down there to press it down

601
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,940
but the problem was it was still a

602
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:07,360
little grabber left and that gravel

603
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:10,570
well I skip one play now let's go to

604
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,000
what's more the p40 inlet as a plane got

605
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,330
up because of the dirt they had

606
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,840
installed filters on a site of the inlet

607
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:22,330
of the engine and the aerodynamics of

608
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,790
that filter which was sucking air into

609
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,340
the engine worked real fine at first on

610
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:30,100
the ground but as a plane game speed and

611
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,980
the tail got up suddenly the air foil

612
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:35,530
there stream broke and went back and

613
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,260
rear and the engine immediately suffered

614
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,850
and couldn't get enough pressure enough

615
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,290
take off down there can you follow that

616
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,450
I don't know if I made that play enough

617
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:46,630
but all I want to tell you that great

618
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:49,060
ideas can be done can be had can be

619
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,560
executed on the ground everybody thinks

620
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,450
is fine they ran the engine on the

621
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,190
ground all works beautiful now we have a

622
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,580
filter now we keep the little gravel out

623
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,590
and what half

624
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,320
later the airplane couldn't even take

625
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,910
off we lost many an airplane later which

626
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,920
could not again enough power in

627
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:07,130
available runway taken off with that Don

628
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,630
Phil Dean till I as a master sergeant I

629
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,340
could never get a commission being an

630
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,640
enemy alien at that point of our still

631
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,920
enemy alien set and put out an order

632
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,410
signed by general Chennault no more you

633
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,940
so filters leave the filters out and let

634
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,160
the way engine way out if you have to

635
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,290
but at least take off that plane take up

636
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,630
for runway now came the other thing I

637
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:28,540
was going to mention before then two

638
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,710
years later we got more modern planes

639
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,660
armored North American p-51 streamlined

640
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,460
ready for the wall more power

641
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,500
British engines in their rolls-royce

642
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,480
engines congratulations whether British

643
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,490
gentlemen it is know yet that are they

644
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,620
okay congratulate you the hell of a good

645
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,900
engine down there two-stage supercharger

646
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,640
we loved it except you had a different

647
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,560
yeah you had a different ignition system

648
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,590
on the right side on the left side now

649
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,360
that was more complicated but you know I

650
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:00,830
can never talk about that later but

651
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:04,550
anyhow there was that p-51 streamliners

652
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,070
could be long range with the inlet air

653
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:10,370
inlet not anymore on the side on front

654
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:14,170
but behind the pilot below the pilot

655
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:17,240
seat was Inlet and again the same misery

656
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:21,170
existed the propeller shaft and through

657
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,420
little bit of rocks into the inlet which

658
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,220
was uneasy play now in Europe that

659
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,990
wasn't happen in America they wouldn't

660
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,300
have you had a smooth runway jazz I

661
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,920
could sweep it at the head people hand

662
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,740
sweeper the prisoner's dude and so on

663
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,960
but in China it was impossible and the

664
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,940
only way to fix all the leaks which then

665
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,980
the result of later from underneath the

666
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,500
aircraft they're hit by liberal rocks

667
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,110
was when I came through on Thanksgiving

668
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,140
Day 1943 we made a very great surprise

669
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,310
rate on the Japanese or long-range they

670
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,480
didn't know the people if you want that

671
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,510
come we didn't know either till the

672
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,490
night before and I bought some from the

673
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,950
Chinese some bicycles that put bicycle

674
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,660
spokes into it put the nuts on the other

675
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,370
side and at least I could fly the

676
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,500
missions are one of most successful miss

677
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,900
milray at 64 enemy aircraft destroyed

678
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,840
and not a single loss and anything that

679
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,410
was that was a good deal okay one more

680
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,860
thing

681
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:16,310
by China I was just about four months in

682
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,230
a regular US Army Air Corps not anymore

683
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,980
the Flying Tigers they were discontinued

684
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:24,050
in 42 per contract and I stayed in per

685
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,060
special provision Secretary of War

686
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,740
Stimson gave general Chennault

687
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:31,010
permission he became a general in the

688
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,750
meantime to keep me in the military and

689
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,820
I was very proud of it I got paid not

690
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,130
only Master Sergeant pay I got overseas

691
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,410
pea got flying pay it was just a great

692
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,960
great entertainment for me the whole

693
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,330
thing when a few months after this

694
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,850
happened to North had me cold in his

695
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,590
office and said no one I got a job for

696
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,690
you I said well I am busy as can be and

697
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:55,000
he could see my black hands and all the

698
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:59,330
covers and said I need a Japanese zero

699
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,220
flying by flown by American pilots we

700
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,500
got to put a zero to get a final what a

701
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,360
dumb thing does it flies higher than we

702
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,100
do by several thousand feet it flies

703
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,550
faster by 50 miles per hour

704
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,590
it flies further by 8,000 miles distance

705
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,420
further it does many many things we have

706
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,700
never thought the Japanese were able to

707
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,740
do we only knew of Japanese toys which

708
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,690
break and rust you know you old folks

709
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,520
remember that but nothing that they

710
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,280
build an aircraft which was absolutely

711
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,410
superior to any Germans built at that

712
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,990
time even the Spitfire I hate to say at

713
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:32,600
that point zero was superior at that

714
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,070
particular point if you can afford what

715
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,630
they could have what they thought they

716
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,810
could afford but couldn't afford namely

717
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:42,020
the loss of a pilot episode the reason

718
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:44,060
why the zero was so good was a I found

719
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,970
out after I put the first jabbsi row

720
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:51,140
together from shut down pieces as was

721
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:53,060
done in 19 February 1943 I was finished

722
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,640
with it I got sick as hell in a process

723
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,610
but anyhow the plane was brought over to

724
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,140
enure I went with it and I got orders

725
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,660
from general Arnold to take the plane

726
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,580
apart and separate to the United States

727
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,800
and then go back to over to the United

728
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,140
States and put it together again and

729
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,900
sell war bonds over there but this was

730
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,480
done after American pilots flew the zero

731
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,700
against other American planes flown by

732
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,770
American pilots to find out what

733
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,220
technique what fighting technique could

734
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,390
be used with that superior plane we

735
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,100
point out one

736
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,929
japanese pilots have no parachutes

737
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,210
parachute weighs 40 pounds something

738
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:31,070
like that japanese plane 2 has no armor

739
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,260
plating protection like all plane set

740
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,080
japanese planes had no self-sealing fuel

741
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,150
tanks they used all the fuel capacity to

742
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,880
put fuel and not to put fuel protective

743
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,610
or leakage protective supplement and so

744
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,660
on so again a lot of things we learned

745
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,350
there at that time and the new war

746
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,900
memorandum came out which was

747
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,150
distributed in South Pacific also came

748
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:56,059
as a result of having a zero namely

749
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,280
never dogfight with the Japanese zero

750
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,919
only make a pass at him from high

751
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,710
altitude this was only when he had to

752
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,530
fly low to escort his bombers who were

753
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,860
no damn good but he do header as head of

754
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,840
a company I'm and so Americans had a

755
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,850
chance to make a pass at a zero then

756
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,679
dive away and dive away and come on

757
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,070
climbed back again the other way and

758
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,960
make another pass it okay incidentally

759
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,120
during the rest of the war the Japanese

760
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,870
didn't improve the aircraft but very

761
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,299
very little

762
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,740
they lost had lost all their good pilots

763
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:32,000
in the first two years of the war and

764
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,860
from 1943-44 it was really no more real

765
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,270
battle against the Japanese air force we

766
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,980
had all the modern planes we had the

767
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:40,910
modern bombers then finally we had a

768
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:43,370
nuclear bomb okay now I was supposed to

769
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,080
speak about one hour so we have another

770
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,070
half I'm just halfway through that's

771
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,169
exactly what happened the war was over I

772
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,990
had gone to the United States I had been

773
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:55,040
transferred into the OSS some of you may

774
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,860
have heard about that

775
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,059
that was the intelligence for the CIA is

776
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:04,730
today was it OSS during the war and

777
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,830
there I had I met the commanding general

778
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,330
white Bill Donovan who had passed away a

779
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,060
few years ago but just now book was

780
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,550
written about him and he helped me

781
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,590
decide by God we'll go to make an office

782
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,530
out of you and you don't have to go to

783
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,260
China anymore and whatever it takes

784
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,850
we'll do well after two three months in

785
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,010
the United States during which time I

786
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,570
met my charming wife said there which

787
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,530
was the only good thing really happened

788
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:32,659
over here so but she was not my wife

789
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,119
that time I mean she was wife after that

790
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:37,070
after the war I asked for return to

791
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,200
China I sent a telegram to Donald

792
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,420
to say dear general America is beautiful

793
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,280
but please can be back to China so I

794
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,170
came back to China still a mother's

795
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,350
heart is still an enemy alien and in May

796
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:51,680
of 45 I received a telegram from this

797
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,600
young lady saying very simple bill

798
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,310
introduced in Congress to make you

799
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,590
citizen congratulations

800
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,810
Clarisse that was Anna and what indeed

801
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,720
happened is a general Donovan pulled his

802
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:06,230
rank and his influence and Congress

803
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,820
passed a special law that I never have

804
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,770
resided the United States became an

805
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,140
American citizen and I was told only two

806
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,030
times all together that was done once as

807
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,420
Winston Churchill at the segment was

808
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,740
Gardner so I became a soon and when I

809
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,490
came back talked to the wall

810
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:26,180
I joined Douglas Aircraft research in

811
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:29,210
Santa Monica California there we worked

812
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,490
I worked on afterburners now you know

813
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,530
and after Bernays a jet engine in front

814
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,800
then comes if you want additional swash

815
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,380
for military plane to go supersonic and

816
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,240
afterburner that was in those days

817
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,280
responsibility of the airplane builder

818
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,110
now there's part of the engine builder

819
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,120
because it really is integrated with the

820
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,730
engine pratt whitney General Electric

821
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,310
whoever else makes engine slows voice we

822
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,020
all have afterburners following the

823
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,810
engine as part of the engine builders

824
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,670
responsibility okay

825
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,930
and it wasn't was interesting

826
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:05,330
fascinating my girlfriend lived in

827
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:08,480
Connecticut but was usually overseas in

828
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:11,270
South America and Europe somewhere and I

829
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,700
was just doing well when I got a

830
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,350
telegram from Shanghai China all the

831
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,230

832
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,630

you want to come back like to have you a

834
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,610
special project engineer so he gave me a

835
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,290
salary figure which was a multiple of

836
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,390
what I made a Douglas tax free and

837
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,460
everything whole trip paid free matter

838
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:35,330
of fact he asked me to be one of the

839
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:38,180
crew members of 24 war-surplus commerce'

840
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:41,750
46 big twin-engine transports he bought

841
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:43,700
to fly from a why over to China which it

842
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:46,490
was illegal to fly a twin-engine

843
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,220
propeller plane over the Pacific Ocean

844
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:51,090
but snow couldn't tell us what was rule

845
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,520

850
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:05,730

dock in 1947 now I can tell you a long

874
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,380
story now make it in two sentences or

875
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,660
three sentences because you want to go

876
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,780
to jet engines the three sentence where

877
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,120
when the whole the Communists came back

878
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,530
by that time Japan was defeated the

879
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,850
Communists came in the communist

880
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,920
communist from the north

881
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,420
pushed us further south further south

882
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,640
finally the airline had to leave

883
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,400
Shanghai it would have kept on canned on

884
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,930
Hong Kong from there to Taiwan and at

885
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,240
that point my wife said I have enough of

886
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,150
it I she said I said I'd enough of it we

887
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,670
both had enough of it we had gone home

888
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,500
Holly went home that time was no regular

889
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,990
airline service yet that time there was

890
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,210
no shipping service yet unless you're

891
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,490
the military and believe it or not

892
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,830
you're looking at the only man and

893
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:43,230
they're certain the only woman who ever

894
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:45,960
together with a dog in a Jeep drove from

895
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,360
the Orient to the Mediterranean Sea with

896
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,190
automap except National Geographic that

897
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,440
big that was Asia our Europe was a

898
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,180
little bit hanging in the corner today

899
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,080
we had no map but there was a red line

900
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,010
on that map

901
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:01,290
it says Ganga scan made that trip that's

902
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,360
a truth we have no idea where we get

903
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,770
gastly we had no idea we get food where

904
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,420
we go to sleep all I knew

905
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,510
let's get awfully cotan of Kansas Tana

906
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,570
winter and so we left in October with

907
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,920
Royal Air Force jeeps I bought three

908
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:16,770
real warrior for Jeeps

909
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,000
all put together because one of the good

910
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,290
body one of the good engine wants

911
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,580
something else I made a good edge out of

912
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:26,640
it and we drove 10,000 miles we carried

913
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,710
with us a great overload four-wheel

914
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,050
drive and I learned a lot but you could

915
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,060
use to later the four-wheel drive is

916
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,310
great but if you have that heavy loader

917
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,370
like we had like 52 gallons of gasoline

918
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:40,740
which means 10 jerry cans gasoline at

919
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,450
the own tankful already six seven

920
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,890
hundred pounds right there and winter

921
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,680
clothes and summer clothes there's no

922
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,590
change the tools and everything it's we

923
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,760
had a range of about a thousand match

924
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,170
well I can tell you a lot about that

925
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,740
trip and I'm sure you would like to hear

926
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:58,080
a lot about it but I promised dr. Kolb

927
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,990
we're going to jet engines I came back

928
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:03,000
to the biote around from Tehran I know

929
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,220
is no more challenge there were roads

930
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,440
again at least mark road somewhere else

931
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,200
for roads going over the Mount all the

932
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
way to Iraq Baghdad but Baghdad to the

933
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,010
Royal Kingdom of Jordan Jordan to

934
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,710
Jerusalem open to them to Tel Aviv and

935
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,080
from there back to the United States we

936
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,240
saw the Jeep to the American potter's

937
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,750
company in Jerusalem for the same money

938
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,800
I paid for Hong Kong and enterin I wrote

939
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,810
a letter to brother Whitney and a letter

940
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,460
to General Electric who I know both will

941
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,640
make jet engines I didn't know the rest

942
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,260
of them was on the East Coast and then

943
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,230
I'm coming back in about three months

944
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,030
and I'm looking for a job so DiSanto

945
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,060
pride wouldn't have answered General

946
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,530
Electric the Nance either but I called

947
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,120
John electric it happened to be the

948
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,370
person that yes you are the guy with a

949
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,080
pretty stamps yes I they are aware of

950
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,430
the pretty stamps well we made your

951
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,740
letter to Lynn Massachusetts

952
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:58,410
Lynn Massachusetts makes jet engines for

953
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,940
GE and you call them I called them to

954
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,350
say oh yeah we're waiting for you come

955
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,700
right up and we came right up the

956
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,070
following day they interviewed me and

957
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,980
hired me on the spot

958
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:09,870
310 that time was weird $50 a month I

959
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:11,610
was a said don't tell anyone that's so

960
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:14,130
much money but don't tell anyone and I

961
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:16,740
started on tests that the best thing you

962
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,750
can do when you leave here with your

963
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,300
degree is to get

964
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,579
into a company in a subject Oh which

965
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,260
makes gadgetry whatever you like whether

966
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,079
it's aircraft engines or airplanes or

967
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,390
electronics whatever it is get on test

968
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,240
on test you find out what goes haywire

969
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:35,550
and I was lucky that the big boss of the

970
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,890
outfit here in Lynn Massachusetts knew a

971
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,319
damn foreigner came in now and he's here

972
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,480
any other mentos impact on Flying Tigers

973
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,150
and everything else he made me report to

974
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,790
him every morning at 8 o clock shop what

975
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,310
went wrong in the past 24 hours on the

976
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:53,819
jet engine development and those days we

977
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:56,130
switched over from a scientifical I 16

978
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:59,310
and I 40 which we copied from the

979
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,650
British into an axial flow engine which

980
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,510
we copied from the Germans just let's

981
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,420
face it no one said it in a book but

982
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:09,540
it's an exact copy of the engine which

983
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,569
drove the Messerschmitt 262 it's a

984
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:15,300
little log compressor but the same idea

985
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:17,280
long combustion system little bit better

986
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,260
a little higher temperature a little

987
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,150
better turbine or better materials

988
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,849
because the Germans had no good material

989
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,760
of course had to cool the hollow turbine

990
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:28,589
buckets which operated at 1400 to 1500

991
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,380
degree Fahrenheit which has already

992
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:32,819
grown dog red if you do that and they

993
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,210
had to cool it in order to keep them

994
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:35,520
together

995
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,680
we had better material we had molybdenum

996
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,420
we had all kind of other things and so

997
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,700
we built the first engine which was

998
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,520
called the TG 180 forget about the

999
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,400
number the next one was TG 190 we put in

1000
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,890
mass production that was G's number the

1001
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:56,579
actual military mobile j-47 we both

1002
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:58,160
37,000 j-47 engines just in time for the

1003
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:02,190
Korean War

1004
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:06,300
every f-86 which was now a jet plane was

1005
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:11,280
part by j-47 the b-47 bomber six engines

1006
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:14,160
all six j-47 unelected a forty sevens B

1007
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,800
36 bombers which had four big Pratt

1008
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,109
Whitney engines ran very well we added

1009
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,440
in order one a little better with 4G jet

1010
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:25,170
engines two and a each wingtip and so we

1011
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,970
were suddenly in the business till they

1012
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,099
get them until the Korean War was over

1013
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,820
and the engines were kind of obsolete

1014
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:34,520
the pressure ratio was five to one

1015
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,680
in about twelve stages and there was the

1016
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,020
end of it but at that time I had been

1017
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,090
transferred from the testing into

1018
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,130
running the research laboratory somebody

1019
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,720
picked me up and said look that Don

1020
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,220
thing is sitting here it's the biggest

1021
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,990
in the world Pratt Whitney claims they

1022
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,880
were to build a bigger one we need

1023
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:53,440
something to test components like

1024
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:56,060
compressors full-scale high altitude

1025
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,610
evacuated was big suction pumps to get

1026
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,290
the altitude up to 60,000 feet 70,000

1027
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:02,870
feet up to hundred thousand feet

1028
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:05,690
altitude with air speeds at that time

1029
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,460
subsonic not yet supersonic but we all

1030
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,260
intended to go supersonic of course

1031
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,210
ultimately so we ought to have

1032
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,370
supersonic capability and all together

1033
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:16,190
it was a very fascinating a job for

1034
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,590
compressors turbines and combustion

1035
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,770
systems and I had a chance since I now

1036
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:23,360
was in charge of the laboratory

1037
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,370
following orders of the engineers was

1038
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:29,090
MIT degrees and whatever else ahead on

1039
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:31,430
their following orders what to do but to

1040
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,350
carry out and tell my wife and she would

1041
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,210
loves about it it was more difficult to

1042
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,710
operate the research laboratory than the

1043
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,310
equipment I want to test I tell you that

1044
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,400
right now

1045
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:43,040
to run as massive equipment cooled by

1046
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,350
4,000 gallon of ocean waters per minute

1047
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,390
which we suck into cooled of fresh water

1048
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,340
and the fresh water circulating through

1049
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:52,400
exhaust and so on to cool the

1050
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,020
temperature down to minus 60 - 70 and to

1051
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,790
dry the air otherwise all the

1052
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,250
instruments get a little bit of snow on

1053
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:00,380
top down there and freeze up and to do

1054
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,690
this I could tell you a long story

1055
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,180
just running laboratory but in the

1056
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,580
process as we try to get the pressure

1057
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,650
ratio which all our theoretical people

1058
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,200
say boy if you could go to ten to one

1059
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:14,510
instead of five to one or twelve to one

1060
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,430
boy what we could do nice plug that a

1061
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:20,060
compressor and I said why the hell don't

1062
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:22,670
they rotate the first few stationary

1063
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,280
veins which are always ahead of a

1064
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,830
rotating one now you all know I assume

1065
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,410
what is you have a state of Ain a row of

1066
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:32,240
Stata veins and then a rotor and then

1067
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,760
another state obeyed another rotor

1068
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,610
another state of Ain another rotor stage

1069
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,190
all put together to build up pressure

1070
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,080
which builds up on a negative side of

1071
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,930
the state of Ain let's say well if we

1072
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,740
rotate those and as a speed goes up but

1073
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,900
I got a patent

1074
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,869
to make a long story short every engine

1075
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,869
you fly today has that variable status

1076
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,910
system six stages variable summit five

1077
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:57,410
stages some four stages but I got a

1078
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,090
patent and suddenly I got a big name at

1079
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,610
general acting and the next thing what

1080
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,290
happened is that my boss called the big

1081
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,350
boss vice president of General Electric

1082
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:08,840
and a secretary our secretary 12 of us

1083
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:10,190
had one secretary said the big boss

1084
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,510
horse talked to you and I thought she

1085
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:13,610
was kidding I didn't want to go and

1086
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,490
after I said you damn well better go I'm

1087
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:19,340
not kidding you so I did go over

1088
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:21,110
shivering and he said sit down here I

1089
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,420
sat down I said I understand you're

1090
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:25,970
bitching about our engines that they are

1091
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,980
hard to maintain they are not one and as

1092
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,560
well as they should you could do better

1093
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:33,440
I said yes I made some comments he said

1094
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,780
ok we're going to have a competition now

1095
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,080
remember that another lesson competition

1096
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,180
internally don't wait for the outside

1097
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,070
internally another team of whatever you

1098
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,630
design how does I need different you'll

1099
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:47,420
find out the other guys have some good

1100
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:51,290
ideas too we had to a competition with

1101
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:54,020
two teams one variable status like I had

1102
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,060
won water and another one put another

1103
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,830
rotor in front of the one water so there

1104
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:00,140
were two different rotors like the pod

1105
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,150
woody engine all heads and since Pratt

1106
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,700
wouldn t already was running a dual

1107
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,470
water engine we thought well we'll be so

1108
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,910
far behind at that point and the

1109
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:11,720
decision was made to go variables theta

1110
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:13,100
today we have everything we have the

1111
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,750
whole world has now operating the

1112
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,350
russians and pratt whitney variable

1113
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:20,690
status and we added another rotor to the

1114
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,950
whole thing like pride we needed to so

1115
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,760
we all have practically identical

1116
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:28,550
engines for supersonic flight and so on

1117
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:32,119
so i got eight tons on this one new

1118
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:34,400
engine which was called j79 and again we

1119
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,590
hit a just right if you call it hitting

1120
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:42,560
it right when a war was it vietnamese

1121
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:46,550
war starting 62 63 64 67 69 71 72 every

1122
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:50,330
phantom fighter to j79 every f-104

1123
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:54,530
starfighter YG's every night you can go

1124
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:57,230
down line 79s are all over and they're

1125
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:59,190
nato the whole NATO Air Force's all but

1126
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,320
England England Edward

1127
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:05,490
but everybody else the Germans the Danes

1128
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:08,400
the Italians everyone built j7i on the

1129
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:11,730
license over there this engine grew and

1130
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,260
pressure ratio up to twelve to one with

1131
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,330
the single rotor in variable status

1132
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:18,570
which was called the big progress right

1133
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:20,340
there one single shaft all these three

1134
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,380
bearings one in front one in the middle

1135
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,180
and one in the rear instead of five

1136
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,790
bearings and seven bearings are bearing

1137
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,740
each bearing you know what a bearing is

1138
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:30,840
right the ball bearing or what a roll of

1139
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,760
a each bearing eat seals and need

1140
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,740
lubrication system and lead to scavenge

1141
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,750
system it just sounds simple to put a

1142
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:39,750
bearing it but you put a bearing it

1143
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:42,330
which has lubrication or constantly

1144
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,760
running through it and scavenge it up

1145
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,830
and seal the air from getting in and so

1146
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,780
on you have a heck of a lot more

1147
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:52,380
difficult things to do than when you

1148
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:55,560
draw on a map here is that a hurricane

1149
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,720
but there's no very kid I just say that

1150
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,490
because dr. Kobler was nice enough to

1151
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,380
show me all the few things he has

1152
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:04,800
planned to do was some of you fellas who

1153
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:09,030
are his students the lesson learned

1154
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:13,470
there is talk with the people who use

1155
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:15,030
the engine who use your product I became

1156
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,740
a big shot at that time I was a vice

1157
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,930
president of a company I became in

1158
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,090
charge of a total division of the total

1159
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:24,359
aircraft is aware 22,000 people at that

1160
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:26,550
time go to 25,000 people go up to 30,000

1161
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:29,340
people 32,000 people became a huge

1162
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,650
organization and under me where another

1163
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:34,050
group of six vice presidents and then

1164
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,970
we'll other in levels the typical seven

1165
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:39,359
level organization you know I would

1166
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:41,850
never get the truth up what's really

1167
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,940
going on from the bottom to the top it's

1168
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:46,590
impossible you learn it I hope you

1169
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,650
remember that now I said it and you

1170
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:51,359
bring it up again talk to people who use

1171
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,300
a machine and talk to your service

1172
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,609
people out in the field and talk to the

1173
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,670
image manufactured people what is

1174
00:49:56,609 --> 00:50:02,010
difficult so that you get the real truth

1175
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,750
to it and what the only way to do it is

1176
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,730
I pulled out a serviceman and he'll

1177
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,530
report to me directly now part of the

1178
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,500
quality control man had report to me

1179
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,799
directly and I had 14 people reported me

1180
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:17,009
including one professional SEO

1181
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:17,789
now he was a Navy captain retired and I

1182
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:20,729
had it with me

1183
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:23,759
the other saw a puss and he was a nasty

1184
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:25,890
guy and I say you know Schmitt the right

1185
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:27,869
thing for you is to be natural be I want

1186
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,869
you to take every decision any one

1187
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:32,339
decision I want to make and I were in a

1188
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:35,819
democratic organization

1189
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:38,160
I had 51 percent of the vote so there

1190
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,969
was no problem there I said you'll go

1191
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,439
over it

1192
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:46,169
hostile try to find a father now I often

1193
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:48,419
correct it what I wanted to do as a

1194
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:51,059
consequence of his talk something I did

1195
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:53,579
I didn't have to do that but I just want

1196
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:55,439
to tell you if you ever have management

1197
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,839
that you will have a generation from now

1198
00:50:55,439 --> 00:50:59,910
and you're 40 years old 45 years old

1199
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,799
you're running organization and you let

1200
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:04,559
people remember that that old bald guy

1201
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:08,609
down there who talked and told you to

1202
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:10,919
get quality customer service and visit

1203
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:13,559
the customer yourself talk to them on a

1204
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:16,769
phone if necessary call no way Norwegian

1205
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:18,989
airline SES call the Tahitian Airways

1206
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:21,390
which operates all angels today today

1207
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:25,140
Jon Electric is the largest jet edge of

1208
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:27,059
an effect on the world we have 42,000

1209
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,249
people primarily my engines which I

1210
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:31,589
design in those days it takes 20 years

1211
00:51:29,249 --> 00:51:34,499
from the day you decide to build an

1212
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:36,779
engine 10 years to get it to test and

1213
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:38,969
run it right at another 10 years before

1214
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:40,799
you begin to make money because the

1215
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:42,269
first price you have to put on it you're

1216
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:43,529
going to lose money on every engine the

1217
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,299
more engine you sell the more money you

1218
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:48,059
lose and that then takes a while until

1219
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:49,799
it slowly comes up the cost gets cheaper

1220
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,659
and cheaper and lowered lowered you find

1221
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:52,799
an easier way to make buckets you don't

1222
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:54,959
machine them anymore

1223
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:57,239
turbo bucket you cast it which is much

1224
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:59,789
simpler or you castables in dimensions

1225
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,619
of about 20,000 of an inch and you get

1226
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:03,509
it down to where you really begin making

1227
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,189
money today again at General Electric

1228
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:08,539
there's no secret you read a stock

1229
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:10,709
report of your energy stock it is a most

1230
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:12,929
money-making group of General Electric

1231
00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:14,459
products between refrigerators and

1232
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:17,309
freezers and light bulbs and general

1233
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:20,039
general motors electric motors I mean

1234
00:52:17,309 --> 00:52:22,319
and whatever it is the jet engines make

1235
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,509
the most money and of course Pratt

1236
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,190
Whitney now will be out to trying to

1237
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:30,960
catch an electric and rolls-royce

1238
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:33,060
crying again but I hope the people in my

1239
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,890
place whom I left behind will keep on

1240
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:40,740
feeling insecure last lesson feel

1241
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:42,600
insecure don't ever feel secure whether

1242
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:46,710
you ride a motorcycle like I did to work

1243
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:49,110
or whether you ski or whether you design

1244
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,760
and think well or if your pride wedding

1245
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,700
are held unlikely we'll never make it

1246
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,020
I'm sure that's what they thought I

1247
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,330
assume so that's what they thought but

1248
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,220
they would GE made it because it takes a

1249
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:00,360
while in which they lost management and

1250
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:02,760
they lost some good people and good

1251
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,800
people retired plan when you lost a hell

1252
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,190
of a bunch of very very good people who

1253
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,930
retired I know that and I always grew up

1254
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,340
now I hope that when we're going up to

1255
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,680
we're going to stay we're a bright-eyed

1256
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:16,080
bushy-tailed on top but I'm not sure but

1257
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,430
feel insecure don't ever think you

1258
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,440
haven't made till you I'm better and

1259
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:21,660
sleep I tell you that that that's one

1260
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,520
thing you drive home a motorcycle lady

1261
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,830
gets open to the car door and you hit

1262
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,810
the right side to hit that open car door

1263
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,280
for two-door car and boy you going right

1264
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:32,610
over the radio I got a big hole of my

1265
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,520
left like I tell you that so lot of

1266
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:40,020
things can happen but just feel insecure

1267
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,990
now it is exactly three minutes before

1268
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:44,550
one hour now would you like to ask some

1269
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:51,840
questions or any particular area would

1270
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:54,240
you like to hear four questions

1271
00:53:51,840 --> 00:54:03,710
I want to make three remarks first

1272
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:07,430
pregnant engineers we talked about

1273
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:10,740
having the effect of changing away the

1274
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:14,180
world becomes and I think our speaker

1275
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:16,710
today has taken part in that chain

1276
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:19,590
transportation has changed and I hope it

1277
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:22,170
never changed back to what was the

1278
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:25,260
second thing is I want to repeat the

1279
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,480
advice that he gave that is you've got

1280
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,300
to get out and get a moment there's just

1281
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:35,080
no substitute talking to you

1282
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:37,240
the guy with the skinned knuckles it's

1283
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,160
all different than the real world and if

1284
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,430
you're going to be a work with with

1285
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:46,150
equipment you got to do that the third

1286
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:48,310
is there is a book which is in the

1287
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:50,920
library I'm told that the only language

1288
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:53,890
you can buy it in right now is Chinese

1289
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,800
or German it's called urban the German

1290
00:54:53,890 --> 00:55:02,590
if you want to read about this trip from

1291
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:05,200
from China the Tel Aviv and I assure you

1292
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:07,360
that it's worth the effort to get it to

1293
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,640
read it now when take a couple minutes

1294
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,390
for those of you that want to leave it

1295
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,740
have carpools or whatever and then with

1296
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:18,010
your permission we'll have a few

1297
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:19,630
questions tonight it like thank you very

1298
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:23,130
much for listening and thank you very

1299
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:23,130
much for your comment I appreciate

1300
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:42,700
are there questions that may I make a

1301
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:44,109
comment not based on your comments but

1302
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,760
that you don't get a wrong impression

1303
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:47,440
that an engineer doesn't have to do

1304
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,820
engineer work you are on the right

1305
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,859
profession I think there's no more

1306
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:53,530
exciting job than engineering job and

1307
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:55,630
you do need the aerodynamic knowledge

1308
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:57,430
and you need the mechanical strength but

1309
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,740
you also need specifications that's one

1310
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:01,780
thing I forgot to say specifications

1311
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,790
besides walking around you've got to

1312
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,670
have good specs on their specs which are

1313
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:08,800
reasonable which are proper like how

1314
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:13,090
much of a material strength sorry

1315
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:15,609
designed to 85% 90% 92% or whatever the

1316
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:17,500
case this is all very very important

1317
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:20,080
later in the field on a wall that poor

1318
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,119
soldier with a piece or bullet going

1319
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:24,490
through the blades that blade will break

1320
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:26,680
right off if it's designed to a limit

1321
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:29,800
like that and there are many many of

1322
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:33,160
these examples where a material fall

1323
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,470
flaw may be locally there which normally

1324
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,810
wouldn't make a piece fail but it failed

1325
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:41,320
because you designed it too close to the

1326
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:53,230
limit so a good specification is worth a

1327
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:57,760
lot why we do it

1328
00:56:53,230 --> 00:57:01,030
oh because it was so big even al is a

1329
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,020
big plant two miles long we bought it

1330
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:06,910
from curtiss-wright war surplus and

1331
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,650
updated it and the highway gone by in

1332
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:10,270
case you ever go there is Newman way I

1333
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,619
don't know if you saw it they named it

1334
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,780
after I was a I didn't even know about

1335
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:16,750
it they named the highway Newman way but

1336
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:18,700
it is for big engines we make in small

1337
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:20,950
angels here military and commercial and

1338
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,750
big engines in Cincinnati you're going

1339
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:25,780
to Inlet or one of these big commercial

1340
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:28,780
engines down there it's eight it's so oh

1341
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:31,000
you're up to eight feet and we had one

1342
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,910
the engine for the supersonic transport

1343
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,890
which President Kennedy wanted and after

1344
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,570
he passed away Congress cancelled it

1345
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,490
right away and I think it did the right

1346
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:42,970
thing of incidentally at this point but

1347
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,869
the engine was a huge engine with 70,000

1348
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:48,119
pounds faster

1349
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:50,799
1961 we ran it we ran 35 engines and so

1350
00:57:48,119 --> 00:58:00,369
we had to do the big facilities and big

1351
00:57:50,799 --> 00:58:03,160
test cells and so on all right okay

1352
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:05,170
very briefly I love the day of you know

1353
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:10,029
that we had a nuclear-powered aircraft

1354
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:12,249
engine running anyone knows all right so

1355
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:14,740
they are okay with nausea I'm surprised

1356
00:58:12,249 --> 00:58:17,019
in other places they had known about it

1357
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,930
I was put in charge of mechanical design

1358
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:21,490
of that nuclear powered engine in 1951

1359
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:24,009
I've just been three years with General

1360
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:26,499
Electric and not a nuclear part of it

1361
00:58:24,009 --> 00:58:29,589
but an engine which could run both on

1362
00:58:26,499 --> 00:58:31,299
chemical fuel on nuclear fuel and on a

1363
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,910
mixture of both so in other words take

1364
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:36,130
off a nuke on regular fuel till you up

1365
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,900
to altitude then switch over to nuclear

1366
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:40,059
power that thing can fly three times

1367
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,249
around the world as long as there's food

1368
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:44,859
for the crew if the engine lasts that

1369
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:47,499
long but that that's another matter but

1370
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:49,950
anyhow we got orders from the military

1371
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:53,380
build a much bigger nuclear engine and

1372
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:57,569
that was cancer to 1960 when aerial

1373
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,569
refueling became a standard technique

1374
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:23,040
no not at all there are 3000 German

1375
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:24,569
officers and men in China helping the

1376
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:30,630
Chinese against the Japanese right

1377
00:59:24,569 --> 00:59:33,150
throughout the war but the Germans

1378
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:34,950
didn't like the Japanese actually the

1379
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:37,109
people didn't like the Japanese if you

1380
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,790
have state injury Oh will you've been

1381
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:40,349
doing it maybe god knows what you're

1382
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:44,280
gonna do you'll be shot Oh nuts not I

1383
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:44,880
don't know that you never do that or

1384
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,910
idea

1385
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,500
hey all let me tell you tell you this

1386
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:53,880
engineers I was caught up in the service

1387
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:57,329
on August 1 1937 when they had total

1388
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,980
draft coming in all engineering students

1389
00:59:57,329 --> 01:00:01,349
and all medical students who

1390
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,000
automatically deferred they knew the war

1391
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:06,059
was coming they needed all the engineers

1392
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,369
to build in a massive thing but look if

1393
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:12,809
I may just add one more thing in this

1394
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:17,510
matter in the six years you can keep

1395
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:21,109
talking till they leave in six years of

1396
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:24,420
hitlerism but all horrible things he did

1397
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:27,089
he dead was able to produce an

1398
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:29,130
incredible amount of weaponry from

1399
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:31,380
submarines to battleships to

1400
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:33,210
88-millimeter and aircraft to jet

1401
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,010
engines to everything else and you have

1402
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:37,349
to give him credit but he didn't do that

1403
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:40,260
himself manufacture of people did it

1404
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:42,540
against his will but he delayed the

1405
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,520
development of jet engines I know that

1406
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,349
as a fact at the German book with just I

1407
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:49,470
gave my last talk I gave a damn per hour

1408
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:51,780
and there someone gave me a fake German

1409
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:55,140
book about German fighter aircraft how

1410
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:57,480
Hitler deliberately ordered the delay or

1411
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:59,400
the stopping of working on jet engines

1412
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,680
on German jet engine because it would

1413
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,690
water down the effort on the other thing

1414
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,930
same as pratt whitney and cutters right

1415
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:08,880
had been told not to work on jet engines

1416
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,020
during world war ii and they left it up

1417
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,180
to Westinghouse and General Electric

1418
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,859
because we were the two electrical

1419
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:15,869
turbine manufacturers and familiar with

1420
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:17,970
it but they didn't want to weaken the

1421
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:19,770
effort of Pratt Whitney Engen Electric

1422
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:21,690
was our good luck that has happened this

1423
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:24,530
way but but that's the way it went

1424
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:24,530
yeah

1425
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,990
no it was a solar Lee a and P aircraft

1426
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,090
nuclear propulsion program gen electric

1427
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:39,770
goes top-secret it was at the even

1428
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:44,900
airplane on the other end completely

1429
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:46,480
fenced in and covered up and is that

1430
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:51,770
right

1431
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:53,690
we'll see while you kept the ticket all

1432
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,100
right I never read about it I think

1433
01:01:53,690 --> 01:02:06,350
that's a short day and I read about it

1434
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:09,200
I'm very good yeah yeah well hi anyhow

1435
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:10,670
I'm glad to see you here I good the

1436
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,180
high-bypass engine all right that was

1437
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,670
another thing

1438
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:19,250
the British led the way there they had

1439
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:22,760
an 8/10 bypass ratio engine the the one

1440
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:25,700
on the the convoy on a cover the weather

1441
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:27,800
convoy and I built the first one was two

1442
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,240
and a half bypass ratio made happen out
