1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Great. Okay. Excited to get the flash

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,960
talk started. So my name is Tavorvor

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,400
Baharov. I'm a secondy year posttock at

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,400
the Eric Mundi Schmidt Center and I'm

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,679
here today to talk about TE-C cells. So

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
through the process of VDJ

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,080
recombination, T- cells recombine their

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,680
genome uh an alpha beta pairings

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
constituting on the order of like 10 to

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,240
the 15 different T- cell receptors. This

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
massive diversity makes estimating an

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,359
individual's T- cell receptor profile

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
both a difficult and important problem.

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,880
So traditionally single cell is used to

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,640
identify these pairings between alpha

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
and beta chains. However, this is

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,840
expensive and can't profile too many

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,360
cells. Bulk on the other hand is cheap

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,520
and can profile many cells but doesn't

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
give you this pairing information. So

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,480
together with Jeremy Simon and Rafaari

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,800
have been working on these kind of

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,719
combinatorial problems and integrating

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
these two different modalities and

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
beyond just bulk and single cell and

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
we've developed some new statistical

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
methods which we're working with Dr.

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
Kathy Woo's lab to validate. So please

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
come by and chat with me at poster one

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,520
if any of this sounds interesting. Thank

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,520
you.

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
Hi I'm Cilate. Um I'm mo my my work is

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,119
motivated by the question of how does

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
the genome sequence encode phenotypic

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,360
structure across levels of complexity.

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
So we have experiments now that measure

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,080
genotype phenotype associations from

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
cells to tissues to organisms and we

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
have really good algorithms that predict

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
these associations and learning from

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
functional genomics and other kinds of

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,400
data. So are there any universal

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,119
principles that let us derive uh

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,759
measured genotype phenotype associations

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,479
uh akin to natural laws in physics? So

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,640
the computational task is to recover

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,880
measured genotype phenotype associations

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,759
from just one phenotypic measurement for

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,000
example one tissue or protein sequence

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
and the reference genome and that's

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,600
without annotations genotype phenotype

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,360
coariation or mechanistic information.

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,079
And what's surprising is by searching

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,200
for structure preserving codes that is

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,439
codes that uh assign genome genomic loi

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
to photypic units preserving similarity

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,360
we can actually solve this problem and

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,840
recover measured associations across

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,720
scales. Um so yeah come check out my

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,720
poster number two.

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,959
All right thank you cil. Can I have

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,959
Shenan up next?

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,120
Um hello everyone my name is Shiny Chen

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,720
and I'm a postto in Jen Shu lab at

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,280
MGH and thank you for the great

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,319
opportunity to share our work today. So

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,000
we are building a value for biology

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,160
basically a gene to image foundation

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,160
model called Jin Vinci. So this work is

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,360
supervised by professors

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,640
colle and Jen Shu. So

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,400
gentri can turn single cell gene

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,319
expression into different kinds of image

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,560
modalities including h images that

75
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,239
immunofllororesence neuromorphology and

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,840
electron

77
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,400
microscopy

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:15,120
and just like deli that can generate

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,599
images from text. So Juventi can aims to

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,280
be a multimodel view of cell states.

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,800
If you are interested, please come to

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,800
our poster number five. Thank you.

83
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you. Can I have Jillian up next?

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
Hi, I'm Jillian. I'm a PhD candidate

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,159
with Ben Rafael at uh in the department

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,239
of computer science um at Princeton. Um

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,239
and I want to talk to you about LAML. Uh

88
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
so one recent approach to studying cell

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
development leverages dynamic lineage

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,080
tracing technologies which involves

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
incorporating a lineage tracing system

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
which is a genome editor that's going to

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
accumulate edits at specified target

94
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
sites in a cell and then that cell

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,640
divides and you can use that to

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
reconstruct the cell division history.

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
So the computational problem there is

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,280
taking those edits summarized in a

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
character matrix which I have on the

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,560
left in the input in the inputs

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
summarized in a character matrix. The

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
computational problem is to infer the

103
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
cell lineage tree. So, LML or lineage

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,239
analysis via maximum likelihood uh

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
infers the maximum likelihood lineage

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
tree and also parameters like timecaled

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
branch lengths and missing data rates.

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Um and LAML infers this is on the right

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,600
hand side now LML infers more accurate

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
tree topologies uh on simulated data but

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
we also see evidence of this in real

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,600
biological data. Um and more importantly

113
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,199
more recently as of the last two months

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
we've reimplemented some key inference

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
steps and now we have the most scalable

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
method um compared to methods of

117
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,960
comparable accuracy. So this is very

118
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
exciting. So if you work on any linear

119
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
tracing or are just interested in cell

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,360
development, please come talk to me. I'm

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,720
at poster number six. We also have a new

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
method that's coming out soon. This is

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,639
Laml Pro which adds obser modeling of

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,639
observation error. So thank you so much.

125
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,759
Thank you Jillian. We have Yasha up

126
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,040
next. Hi everyone. My name is Yasha

127
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,800
Ecifi. I'm a PhD student at Harvard

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,199
Medical School. co-vised by Marine

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Kazitnik and Maha Farhad and I'll be

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,880
talking about my work in Fleming.

131
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,120
Tuberculosis is one of the leading cause

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,880
of death worldwide by infectious disease

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
and although we have antibiotics to

134
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
treat tuberculosis every year those

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,600
antibiotics become less effective due to

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,919
drug resistance. We need new antibiotics

137
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,639
now. However, developing these drugs is

138
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,800
timely and very cost and and costs a lot

139
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,039
of money. And so to address this, we

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,520
developed Fleming, an AI agent for

141
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,280
developing antibiotics for tuberculosis.

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,800
Fleming is basically a large language

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,639
model that we've given a bunch of tools

144
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
that will help it to design a drug. For

145
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
example, a generative model to generate

146
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
an antibiotic and a discriminative model

147
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
to predict given a small molecule

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
whether inhibit the growth of TB or not.

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,639
And we show in our work that Fleming is

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,360
able to mimic the reasoning of medicinal

151
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,800
chemists and potentially design new

152
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,160
antibiotics to treat TB. If you're

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,000
interested to hearing more, please come

154
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,000
by my poster, poster A. Thank you.

155
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,000
Up next, we have Wenbin.

156
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,160
Um, hi everyone. Um, I'm Wbin and I re

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm a recent graduate from UCLA. My work

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
is about the modeling of DM melation

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,680
states. So conventional approach uh you

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
only cares about the first order

161
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
statistics uh limiting the average

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,039
metholation level. Uh this will ignore

163
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,360
the size dependency of different sites.

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
So here the information loss is more

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,600
evident from the toy example where we

166
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
have the two pattern here disting

167
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,560
pattern they have the same metholation

168
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,880
level. So when it comes to uh generation

169
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,319
the pattern pattern one will be more

170
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,400
likely if the sites are truly

171
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
independent but this is not the case in

172
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,440
real data we observe for higher mutual

173
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,520
information between adjacent sites uh

174
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,080
than the what what the independent model

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,319
predicts. So we propose uh two approach

176
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,039
to model the sati dependency. One is a

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,360
heterogeneous headmark model where the

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,440
transition probability is model as a

179
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
function of genomic distance and the

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,919
second one is to implicitly the

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,560
dependency structure uh using the

182
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,680
birectional longshortterm memory uh

183
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,680
network and uh if you want to uh know

184
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,240
more about the generative models and

185
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,720
also the epigenomics uh I would love to

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,280
talk more at my poster and uh here is a

187
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,199
QR code uh if you are if you want to

188
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,199
check the code and details. Thank you.

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Thank you very much. Next we have

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Akquil.

191
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,680
Hi everyone. Uh so I'm Akil coming to

192
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,680
you from UT Austin and uh I'll present

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,039
some work on matrix completion for

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,880
biometically inspired missingness

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,479
patterns. Here on the screen you see

196
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,080
certain kinds of matrix structures which

197
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,319
arise in settings that people in this

198
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
room care about such as serum virus

199
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
interactions, metabolic networks and

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
gene expression. In one sentence, what

201
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
we do is combine transfer and active

202
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
learning in a statistically optimal way

203
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
for these kinds of problems. More

204
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,360
precisely, we have a scalable and robust

205
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,199
algorithm which both tells you what

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,800
matrix entries to select. So this is an

207
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,039
experimental design or a gentic

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,479
component and how to estimate given

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
limited data which is the transfer

210
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,400
learning uh component. So for

211
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,240
binformaticians the takeaway is that you

212
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
should in fact use and critique these

213
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,000
models on your data set. This is very

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,199
flexible and can be used with several

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,800
different kinds of side information

216
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,959
which makes it very advantageous for

217
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,320
practitioners and for biostatistitians.

218
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,080
What's interesting about this work is

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,159
that we develop theoretical guarantees

220
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
and rigorous algorithms and so we'd love

221
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,159
to get your thoughts on those as well.

222
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,560
So please come stop by poster 11 and uh

223
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,560
talk with us.

224
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,560
Thank you male. Next up we have

225
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Christopher.

226
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,959
Hello I'm Chris a first year postdoc at

227
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,680
the cast broad. So our work focused on

228
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:08,519
the on the cat discovery in in a very

229
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,200
similar way to

230
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,160
what Jean Philip discovered earlier

231
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,480
today. Thank you. So we explored

232
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,320
multiple fidia models for

233
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,560
for

234
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,160
molecular molecular representation using

235
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,160
the broad prism propertating data as our

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,880
SR train data set with

237
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,720
the state-of-the-art temprop model.

238
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:39,399
Unfortunately, the results were fairly

239
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,720
mediocre, but with graph graph

240
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,680
isorphism network model

241
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,080
minimal thankfully it worked it worked

242
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,120
significantly better. So, minimal is a

243
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,120
graph modia model pre-trained

244
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,720
on millions of molecules. So I think

245
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,040
this enables significantly better

246
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,279
represent significantly more meaningful

247
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,560
embeddings. So currently we're trying to

248
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,320
arrange the love validation with the

249
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,399
broad center for for development for

250
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,480
development of therapeutics. I also I

251
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,360
also I also want to thank our sponsors.

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
This work was funded by Z MGH CR family

253
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,120
center for cancer research and the human

254
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,120
frontier science program. Thank you.

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Thank you. Next up, we have Alex.

256
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,320
Hi, my name is Alex. I'm um a graduate

257
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,079
student for two more days in Miriam

258
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,160
Haymon's lab. Um we were interested in

259
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,079
characterizing um novel transcription

260
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
factors to rejuvenate old neurons.

261
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,160
Inspired by a bunch of um transcription

262
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,279
factor rejuvenation um projects in the

263
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,880
field, we wanted to um atlas the uh

264
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,680
build a perturbation atlas to find

265
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,760
potential new transcription factors. So

266
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
we used a bunch of algorithms to predict

267
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
transcription factors and the um

268
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
transcriptional effects that they would

269
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,399
have. From that we selected a library of

270
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,240
transcription factors that we predicted

271
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,040
would be rejuvenative. Um we did a large

272
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,839
invivo perturb seek study to um to

273
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,240
validate those. We packaged the ORFs for

274
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,839
156 transcription factors in AAVs. Um

275
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,680
and we generated this large single cell

276
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,160
data set from which we're able to

277
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
validate the um many algorithms that we

278
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
used to predict the transcriptional

279
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
effects of those transcription factors.

280
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,279
So um if you want to hear more about it,

281
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
come talk to me at poster

282
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,600
14. Thank you. Up next we have Pisha.

283
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,800
So TE-C cells are the building blocks of

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,880
the human immune system, but they're

285
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,480
very difficult to predict which antigens

286
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,240
they would bind to, which threats they

287
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,959
can recognize because of cross

288
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,680
reactivity and data sparity. So we deal

289
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,320
with this by introducing a new uh

290
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,720
related but cheaper task of T- cell type

291
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,959
prediction. So this multitask approach

292
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,600
introduces biological context and allows

293
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,480
the model to mirror the way the human

294
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,160
immune system actually works and be able

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,680
to better predict how it would respond.

296
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,360
So the model actually uses a shared

297
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,760
representation from a TCR representation

298
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
model as well as task specific

299
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,519
characteristics from separate

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
classification blocks. So this shared

301
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,519
learning really allows for more

302
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,279
generalized representations. And when is

303
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
this shared learning actually useful? If

304
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,639
you'd like to discuss this, you can find

305
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,880
me at poster 16. I'm Prica. Thank you

306
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,880
very

307
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:37,440
much. Thank you. Up next, we have

308
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,040
Victoria. Hi, I'm Victoria Schuster. I'm

309
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,519
a posttock at the Schmidt Center and

310
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,279
formerly at the University of

311
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,440
Copenhagen. Um, sometimes we deal with

312
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,760
highdimensional data, but not quite as

313
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,240
many samples as we would like. So for

314
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,120
this purpose we've developed a decoder

315
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,360
only generative model that is highly

316
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
data efficient compared to traditional

317
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,079
autoenccoderbased models and learns very

318
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,160
expressive latent representations. We've

319
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,399
applied this to single cell multiomics

320
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,800
data and because there's no encoder

321
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,000
certain things become quite easy for

322
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,480
example integrating novel coariantss um

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
without fine-tuning and incilical

324
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,279
perturbations. My latest project has

325
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,639
been to improve how we can understand

326
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,720
what is learned in latent

327
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,279
representations. And for this purpose,

328
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,240
we use sparse autoenccoders to extract

329
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,600
features and automatically annotate them

330
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,680
with terms from different knowledge

331
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,639
bases. Come see me at poster 17 if you

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,639
want to understand how this works.

333
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,959
Thank you, Victoria. Up is Young Gang.

334
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,519
Hello everyone. I'm Jen from Vrien Women

335
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,000
Hospital and Har Medical School. Our

336
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,000
study mainly focus on how to leverage

337
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
large language model to support

338
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,880
automatic assessment of cognitive

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,360
function sector for dementia patients.

340
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,760
As we know each patient has many

341
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,040
electronic health records in hospital

342
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,279
system. Oral list nodes contains rich

343
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,440
clinical information but actually they

344
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,920
are also longitudinal large scale and

345
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,560
the clinical demand specific that may be

346
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,639
hard to understood by the large language

347
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,279
models. So we need to integrate several

348
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,920
LM technology such as summarizations

349
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,240
such as uh knowledge enhancement with

350
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,079
exter external source such as uh pad or

351
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Wikipedia. So if you are also interested

352
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,040
into improving uh large language model

353
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,760
application in clinical health uh please

354
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,560
feel free to stop by the number 19 to

355
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,560
talk more. Thank you.

356
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
All right thank you Leang

357
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,240
Ying. Uh hi everyone. I'm a first year

358
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,199
post fellow at the Eric administ center.

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,760
So uh qualifying and quantify the exact

360
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,600
role of individual genes and uh their

361
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,000
direct and total uh causal effects on uh

362
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
complex traits is crucial for a better

363
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,560
understanding of the complex uh

364
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,000
biological mechanisms leading to complex

365
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,680
traits variations. So we propose a novel

366
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,519
based network based framework that

367
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,839
integrates JVA's data and gene

368
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,000
expression data from different data

369
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,399
sources to construct the gene gene

370
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,399
phenotype causal network. It allows the

371
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,600
gene expression data and disease traits

372
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,720
to be estimated from different samples

373
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,800
and it exhibits high uh specificity and

374
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,760
precision in identifying causal genes

375
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,600
and showed significantly improved causal

376
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,800
effects estimation accuracy and also the

377
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
identified colins in the UK bang for the

378
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,720
uh disease trees were significantly

379
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,680
enriched for their corresponding

380
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,440
targets. So overall it provides a

381
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,800
flexible and framework for illustrating

382
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,920
the genetic basis of uh complex traits

383
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,199
through a system system level and causal

384
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,199
inference approach. Thank you.

385
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,480
Thank you. Thank you. Up next we have

386
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,959
Shinhi.

387
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,959
Thank you. Hi, my name is Shingho. I'm a

388
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,120
graduate student at Harvard University

389
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
and Broad Institute. Today is my

390
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,680
pleasure and honor to present to you the

391
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,720
AI cyborg system that enables adaptive

392
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,639
modulation of organoid maturation. So in

393
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,959
this work we integrate stretchable

394
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,240
tissue-l like mesh electronics within

395
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,399
human iPSC derived cardiac organoids

396
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,720
allowing for continuous electrical

397
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,279
stimulation and recording without

398
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,199
disrupting the tissue development. So

399
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,120
based on the electrical data we

400
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,120
construct a pseudo temporal trajectory,

401
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,519
a concept adapted from the genomics

402
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,079
analytical methods to represent the

403
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,639
organoid maturation functionally. And

404
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,800
based on this trajectory, we employ a

405
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,040
basin optimization framework with

406
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,120
Gaussium process surrogate model to

407
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,039
learn stimulation policies that

408
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,640
dynamically adapt to the biological

409
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,199
evolving state to achieve optimization

410
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,480
with high sample efficiency. This

411
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,319
approach embarks a new paradigm for

412
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,559
cybernetic control for biological

413
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,120
systems that's integrating real-time

414
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,039
sensing, learning, and actuation. To

415
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,919
learn more about this work, we invite

416
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,400
you to visit us at poster number 21 as

417
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,760
well as our manuscript on bioarchchive

418
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,760
in the QR code. Thank you.

419
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,080
And last up, we have Chase.

420
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,600
Hi everyone, I'm Chase. I'm a first year

421
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,600
posttock at Broad in Harvard Medical

422
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,280
School. And uh one of the benefits of

423
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,160
being last is I see how much time I have

424
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,679
left, which is plenty. Everybody did

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
such a great job going, which means I

426
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,760
get to take as much time as I want, I

427
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,160
think. Um so what I'm going to uh

428
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,720
reemphasize here is uh we heard earlier

429
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,120
in our talk this morning that 90% of

430
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,440
drug targets fail. But one of the things

431
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,919
that uh genetics actually provides is

432
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,320
for instance if you use G-W was data um

433
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,480
Eric medical here showed that uh G-W was

434
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,080
supported drug targets and genetic

435
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,000
supported drug targets actually

436
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,600
increased the success the relative

437
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,280
success of um of drug targets in a

438
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
clinical setting by almost like a factor

439
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
of two. So what I'm going to walk you

440
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,600
through here is our our current model of

441
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,960
of how do you basically integrate

442
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,760
genetics with uh functional annotations

443
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,600
because while genetics supports drug

444
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,840
target discovery, I think a lot of

445
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,840
researchers are still using traditional

446
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,120
meth methods of science which are coming

447
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
through the literature doing our own

448
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,080
experiments collecting all of these

449
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,799
types of relationships to to then

450
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,039
support what they are looking at for

451
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,799
their drug targets. So here we introduce

452
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,360
this model pigeon where we try to take

453
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,600
these gene annotations or gene sets that

454
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,919
share common pathways use genetic

455
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,039
evidence from G-W was to introduce this

456
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,000
new concept of what we're calling

457
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,160
indirect genetic support where genes

458
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,919
could be supported from other high

459
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,919
genetic evidence genes that share a

460
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
functional annotation. And then we use

461
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,400
that to actually prioritize targets. And

462
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
what we see here is if you have now that

463
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,080
you have this these two axes of direct

464
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,559
support and indirect support you

465
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,320
actually can have a continuum of drug

466
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,840
target success and by using both of

467
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,240
these modalities in the statistical

468
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,840
basian framework here uh you can get

469
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
actually really good relative success

470
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,679
related to just even using genetics

471
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,280
alone. So if you want to learn more come

472
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,520
to uh closer 22 and let's run some

473
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,120
pigeon on some of your prior knowledge

474
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,120
and your gene sets. Thanks.
