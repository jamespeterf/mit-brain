a pot of water would you boil off the

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,840
water or use a strainer while homecooks

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,840
would choose the strainer many

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,000
Industries continue to use

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,559
energy-intensive thermal methods of

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,559
separating Outlet liquids in some cases

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,640
that's because it's difficult to make a

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,480
filtration system for chemical

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,320
separation which requires pores small

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,239
enough to separate atoms in other cases

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,879
membranes exist to separate liquids but

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,640
they are made of fragile polymers which

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,000
can break down or gum up in industrial

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,519
emerged from MIT in

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,399
2017 has set out to address these

22
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,560
challenges with a membrane that is cost

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,920
effective and robust made of graphine

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,880
oxide which is a cousin of pencil Le the

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,000
membrane can reduce the amount of energy

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,159
used in industrial separations by up to

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,040
Grant the story of via separations

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
begins in

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,280
2012 when the MIT energy initiative

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
awarded a seed fund Grant to Professor

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,800
Jeffrey Gman who is now the Morton and

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,120
CLA goulder and family professor in

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,879
environmental systems as well as the

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,480
head of mit's Department of Material

56
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,040
Science and Engineering Grossman was

57
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,239
pursuing Research into nanoporous

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,319
membranes for water

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,599
desalination we thought we could bring

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,400
down the cost of desalination and

61
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,239
improve access to clean water says dve

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,239
who worked on the project as a graduate

63
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,680
student in Grossman's lab there she

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,680
teamed up with Brent Keller PhD

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,239
2016 another Grossman graduate student

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,280
figuring out how to debug experiments or

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,000
technology officer we were fast friends

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,319
who spent a lot of time talking about

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
science over

77
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,439
burritos dve went on to write her

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,760
doctoral thesis on using graphine oxide

79
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,920
for water desalination but that turned

80
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,280
out to be the wrong application of the

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,080
technology from a business perspective

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,640
she says the cost of desalination

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,200
doesn't lie in membrane materials she

84
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,280
explains so after dve and Keller

85
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,120
graduated from MIT in

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,439
2016 they spent a lot of time talking to

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,040
customers to learn about the needs and

88
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,400
opportunities for their separation

89
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,799
technology This research LED them to

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,760
Target the paper industry because the

91
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,519
environmental benefits of improving

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,599
paper processing are enormous dve says

93
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,280
the paper industry is particularly

94
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,440
exciting because separation processes

95
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,280
just in that industry account for more

96
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,080
than 2% of us energy consumption she

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,520
says it's a very concentrated high

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,320
energy use

99
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,039
industry most paper today is made by

100
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,600
breaking down the chemical bonds in wood

101
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,919
to create wood pulp which is the primary

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,160
ingredient of paper this process

103
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,199
generates a byproduct called black

104
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,360
liquor a toxic solution that was once

105
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,720
simply dumped into waterways to clean up

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,039
this process paper mills turned to

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Boiling off the water from black liquor

108
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,759
and recovering both water and chemicals

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,919
for reuse in the pulping

110
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:01,039
process today the most valuable way to

111
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,720
use the liquor is as bio Mass feed stock

112
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,280
to generate energy via separations plans

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,479
to accomplish this same separation work

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,960
by filtering black liquor through its

115
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,800
graphine oxide membrane the advantage of

116
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,199
graphine oxide is that it's very robust

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,880
dve says it's got carbon double bonds

118
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,440
that hold together in a lot of

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,440
environments including at different pH

120
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
levels and temperatures that are

121
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,080
typically unfriendly to

122
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,319
materials such properties should also

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
make the company's membranes attractive

124
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,520
to other industries that use membrane

125
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,639
separation Keller says because today's

126
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,560
polymer membranes have

127
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,319
drawbacks for most of the things we make

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,840
from Plastics to paper and gasoline

129
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,560
those polymers will swell or react or

130
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
degrade he says graphine oxide is

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,199
significantly more durable and Via

132
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,680
separations can customize the pores and

133
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,520
the material to suit each industry's

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,560
application that's our secret sauce dve

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,720
says modulating por size while retaining

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,360
robustness to operate in challenging

137
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,680
environments we're building a catalog of

138
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,199
products to serve different applications

139
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,440
Keller says noting that the next target

140
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,319
market could be the food and beverage

141
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,240
industry in that industry instead of

142
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400

separate particular sugars and food

145

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,759
Target customers include pharmaceutical

147
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,440
companies oil refineries and

148
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,960

151
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:49,280
Grossman launched via separations in

152
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:53,000
2017 with a lot of help from MIT after

153
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,080
the seed Grant in 2015 the founders

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
received a year of funding and support

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,039
from the jws solutions program to

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,680
explore markets and to de velop their

157
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,120
business plans the company's first

158
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,960
capital investment came from the engine

159
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,479
a venture firm founded by MIT to support

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,919
tough tech companies which are Tech

161
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,240
businesses with transformative potential

162
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,919
but long and challenging paths to

163
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,879
success they also received advice and

164
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,280
support from mit's Das Pond Center for

165
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,919
technological innovation as well as the

166
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,639
Venture mentoring service and Technology

168
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,520
used to serve the company as Chief

169
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,319
scientist we were incredibly fortunate

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,720
to be starting a company in the MIT

171
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,000
entrepreneurial ecosystem Keller says

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,240
noting that the engine support alone

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,960
probably shaved years off our progress

174
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,759
already via separations has grown to

175
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,000
employ 17 people while significantly

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,080
minute Keller explains to process that

179
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,000
much liquid we need huge areas of

180
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,280

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,199
process which is now capable of making

182
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,360
more than 10,000 square ft of membrane

183
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,360
in one production run is a key

184
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,240
competitive Advantage dve says the

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,960
company rolls 300 to 400 ft of membrane

186
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
into a module and the modules can be

187
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,240
combined as needed to increase

188
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,199
filtration capacity the goal dve says is

189
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,719
to contribute to a more sustainable
