1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,279
There was essentially three types of

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,879
cereal in World War II. Cheerios,

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,240
cornflakes, and Quaker oats. That was

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:14,080
it. Okay. Uh but by 1970,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,880
there was more than 150 breakfast

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
cereals to choose from. Uh including

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,039
ones that are very similar like apple

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,720
cinnamon Cheerios.

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,400
Okay. By 1970s, so ba but basically I'm

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,119
sorry, let me back up. I said this

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
wrong. 1953 type cereals. By 1970, there

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,640
150 cereals. But it wasn't

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
differentiation. It was that stores had

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
realized they could make generic

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,280
versions. So they made odeos which were

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,879
Cheerios a different name but they were

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
Cheerios and then they could just sell

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,399
them. They could sell them at epsilon

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,920
above marginal cost and make money. So

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,239
essentially the cereal companies were

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
not making profits anymore because

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,079
generic products have been introduced to

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,800
essentially mimic what they were making.

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,160
So they product differentiated. In 1989

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
General Mills introduced Apple Cinnamon

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
Cheerios. It's less old than you think.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,879
Okay, it's before you guys, but well

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,159
after me. Apple cinnamon Cheerios. Now,

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,799
when apple cinnamon and Cheerios came

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,159
in, they were delicious objectively.

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,080
Okay, and there was no good substitute.

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,680
So, they suddenly face fairly inelastic

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,520
demand. So, they could raise prices

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,040
above marginal costs. So, General Mills,

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,880
while getting competed to death on

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,960
regular Cheerios, could suddenly have a

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,680
highly profitable apple cinnamon Cheerio

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,560
line. and they patented the apple

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
cinnamon formula. So for a while there

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
wasn't competition. Now there's generic

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
apple cinnamon materials but they

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,520
weren't for the first few years.

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,479
Okay. So by product differentiating

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,159
they ended this death cycle of betron

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,479
competition.

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,360
Is that good or bad?

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's come back to welfare. Yeah. Oh

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,360
just checking your nails question answer

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,360
rather. Uh is that good or bad? Yeah.

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
Well, is it good or bad? Depends very

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
much on your model. We think it's

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,920
probably good because of the principle

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
I've talked about reveal preference,

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,039
which is if people didn't want apple

55
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,599
cinnamon cereals, they wouldn't buy

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,959
them. So, you've created a new in

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,200
product differentiating, you've created

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,040
a new product

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
that consumers want. Indeed, my

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
colleague, very famous economist name

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
Jerry Hman, actually estimated that the

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,599
introduction of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,239
raised consumer surplus by more than $75

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,599
million a year

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,760
because they had this new thing they

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,640
wanted.

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,160
Now, on the other hand,

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,560
they were paying a monopoly price for

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,879
it. So, we are better off in a world

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,720
with apple cinnamon Cheerios than

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,599
without it. But we're still not as good

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,800
off, not not as well off if they weren't

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,959
if there wasn't more competition

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
providing apple cinnamon Cheerios. So it

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
doesn't mean in other words in

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
economists we talk about the we talked

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,239
about the first fundamental welfare

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
theorem, the best we can do. We also

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
talk about the second best which is well

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
the best we can do given constraints we

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
live under.

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,360
So having apple cinnamon chur the best

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,800
we could do. It's the second best. We

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
are better off having apple cinnamon

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
than not. But the first best will be

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,599
apple cinnamon materials with a

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
regulated price at the perfectly

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,360
competitive price or at least above it

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,480
enough to invent new products. So indeed

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,000
today only five firms make most cereals.

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,280
Five firms. There are 5,000 types of

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,360
cereal. 5,000.

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
So that raises

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
another interesting issue. So overall

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
economistic product differentiation is

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,799
good. We think essentially it's driving

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
variety. People like variety. If they

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,599
didn't, they wouldn't buy it. That's

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,720
good.

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,920
But there's starting to be an

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
interesting question in industrial

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,640
organization of the problem of choice

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,120
overload,

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
which is in some sense, are we actually

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,879
do we have too many choices? In

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,360
economics, we assume more choice is

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,879
good. That's our fundamental assumption.

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
But what if now you just get to the you

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
get to the supermarket, you look at

110
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,080
that, you're like, it I'm going to have

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,959
toast. Okay? Because you're like, I just

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
can't decide. There's so much. Well, you

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
could get to the point we're actually

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
worse off from that much product

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
differentiation.
