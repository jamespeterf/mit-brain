00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,240
Hello, I'm Laura Hessie Fischer and

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
you're listening to Today I Learned

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,440
Climate, the climate change podcast of

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,960
the Massachusetts Institute of

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,920
Technology. And today we are talking

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,720
about digging for energy, which is a

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,560
familiar enough idea. It's what coal,

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
oil, and gas companies have been doing

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,480
for over 200 years. But there's

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,439
something else down there. a clean

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,800
source of energy that doesn't contribute

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,960
to climate change and it's not a fuel at

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,680
all. It's not even something that you

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
can hold in your hand. Well, so the

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,239
interior of the Earth is very hot. We

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
have this molten core and all of that

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,399
heat radiates out towards the surface

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,440
and basically passes through under our

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,399
feet every hour of the day, every day of

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,039
the year. My guest today is Professor

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,079
Roland Horn. I'm professor of energy

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,840
science and engineering at Stanford

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,479
University and I'm also the director of

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,520
the Stanford geothermal program.

26
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:12,560
Geothermal literally it means earth heat

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,600
and for billions of years it's been

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,280
sitting there under the earth's crust. A

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,240
molten stew of energy radiating from the

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,600
pressurized metals that make up most of

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,080
our planet. For all practical purposes,

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,000
this energy is infinite and

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,320
inexhaustible. What we call renewable

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
energy like the wind and the solar power

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
that are driving the clean energy

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,439
revolution today. But in one crucial

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,840
way, geothermal is very different from

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,399
solar and wind. The principal difference

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,040
between geothermal and wind and solar is

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
that geothermal is 24/7. It runs all of

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
the time. Doesn't matter whether the sun

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
is out. Doesn't matter the wind is

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,119
blowing. just runs all of the time. And

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,119
that gives it a different position in

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,119
the energy mix to those intermittent

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,680
sources. And most importantly, it

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,000
actually substitutes that same kind of

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,520
availability that we have from, for

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,599
example, coal or gas or nuclear.

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,760
If you're using geothermal power, you

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,080
don't have to worry about the weather or

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,400
when it's nighttime. You don't need

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,440
batteries or a backup generator or

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,040
anything else to provide the reliability

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,520
that we're used to from fossil fuels. So

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,440
why haven't we been using geothermal all

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
along?

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,879
Well, people have been using geothermal

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,519
energy since the Roman times and

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,760
probably long time before that as well.

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
So you know there are many places in the

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
world where hot water discharges at the

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,160
surface and people have been using it

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,800
for bathing and you know medicinal

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,040
purposes for thousands of years. But in

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
a modern era people first generated

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,239
electricity from geothermal energy in

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,720
1904. So the last 120 years or so. Okay.

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,080
Here's how it typically works. First you

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,800
dig two holes into the scorching hot

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,360
rock beneath the earth. You call one

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,720
hole the injection well and the other

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,040
the producer well. The injection well is

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,920
for pumping water underground. You

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,400
inject it into the rock. You need to

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,760
choose a rock that has enough pores and

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,080
cracks to hold this water. The energy in

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
a geothermal system is contained in the

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,879
rock itself. And in order to recover it

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
at the surface, you have to sweep that

81
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,879
energy out by passing the water through

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
the rock. And that's why you need

83
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,519
permeability.

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,720
Inside these natural fractures, the

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,280
water gets very hot. When the water gets

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
hot enough, it rises out through the

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,319
second hole, the producer well. And at

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,879
the surface, as the water escapes the

89
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,400
intense pressures of the earth, that

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,799
water turns into steam. And that steam

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,439
can be used to produce electricity, just

92
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,239
like in a coal or a gas plant. The steam

93
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,760
spins a turbine which powers a generator

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,519
and voila, electricity. Then what is

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,959
left is cooler water and that is put

96
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,079
back in the ground. It gets heated up

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,759
again and produced a second time. And

98
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
that same water goes round and round and

99
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,199
round. There's a lot more nuance here,

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,600
but those are the basics. You drill deep

101
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,720
enough to reach high heat. You pump in

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,800
water, create steam, repeat. Sounds

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
simple enough, right? I mean it's not

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
simple enough that you can go do it in

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,199
your backyard but this is a mature well

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,919
understood technology or at least it is

107
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,240
in places where the geology is just

108
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,240
right. Geothermal electrical plants tend

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,680
to be focused in places which have

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,479
relatively recent volcanism or on the

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,000
edge of tectonic plate boundaries. So

112
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,639
all around the Pacific Ocean for example

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,960
uh there are many geothermal fields in

114
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,840
New Zealand, uh Indonesia, Philippines,

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,479
Japan, California, Mexico, Costa Rica,

116
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,360
and then down into Chile.

117
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,160
There's also a ton of tectonic activity

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,360
in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,800
East Africa. Iceland, which is the home

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,039
of geysers and hot springs, gets a

121
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,680
quarter of its electricity from

122
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,639
geothermal. And Kenya is rather

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,720
interesting in that almost half of the

124
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,039
electricity in that nation is generated

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
from geothermal sources. So they're not

126
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,720
the largest in generation, but the

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
largest in percentage of their energy

128
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,120
coming from geothermal.

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,320
The leading producer of geothermal

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,600
electricity in the world is, you want to

131
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,759
guess? It's the United States and nearly

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
all of it comes from just two states,

133
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,280
California and Nevada. The rest of the

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,320
United States, according the whole of

135
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,000
the East Coast, basically has none. Why?

136
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, because the rest of the United

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,800
States and the large majority of the

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,440
world does not have the right geology.

139
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,280
It doesn't have the nice combination of

140
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:18,840
high heat near the surface and open

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:22,080
permeable rocks. Which is why all told

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,160
just.3% of the world's electricity comes

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,199
from

144
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,560
geothermal. But that's just the story so

145
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,520
far. The real opportunity for geothermal

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,440
might just be getting

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,240
started. For instance, why limit

148
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,520
ourselves to electricity? We need heat

149
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,120
too, right? for big things like smelting

150
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,639
metals and manufacturing cement and for

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,280
small things like keeping our homes

152
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,680
warm. So why not get that heat from the

153
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,400
earth? In fact, there are places where

154
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,400
nearly everyone gets their home heating

155
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,919
from geothermal.

156
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
The district heating system like the

157
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
ones they have in Rekavik, for example,

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,639
in Iceland, it's just another pipe that

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,479
comes into your house from the utility.

160
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,759
So they have one pipe that brings cold

161
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,199
water in the house and they have another

162
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,639
pipe that brings hot water into the

163
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,280
house. This geothermally heated water

164
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,000
travels through whole neighborhoods or

165
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,880
in Iceland's case through almost the

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,960
entire country. The hot water then

167
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,000
exchanges heat with your radiator,

168
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,120
boiler, or central air system, heating

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,440
and sometimes also cooling your home. In

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
Iceland, a lot of that hot water is

171
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,680
actually waste water from their

172
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,400
geothermal plants, but that's actually

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
not even necessary. Boise, Idaho has

174
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,240
district heating, for example, that

175
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,160
takes advantage of naturally hot water

176
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,720
underground. Now, these systems like

177
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,639
geothermal electricity, they need really

178
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,800
high heat underground to work. But the

179
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,800
rest of us can take advantage of

180
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,240
geothermal heat, too. Because it turns

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,599
out that no matter where you live, you

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:12,000
can get 50 or 60° F right near the

183
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,479
surface. And you can use that heat to

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,039
run what's called a groundsource heat

185
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,479
pump. And when I say near surface now,

186
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,160
I'm talking about the top few meters of

187
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,319
ground. So, a ground source heat pump is

188
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,919
a system much like an air conditioning

189
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,720
unit that you might have in the window

190
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,120
of a motel, but instead of discharging

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,000
the heat into the atmosphere outside, it

192
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,919
discharges it into the ground. You might

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
not realize it, but the way that an air

194
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,800
conditioner works is that it's not

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
actually creating cold air to blow into

196
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,000
your home. It's actually drawing heat

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,560
out of your home and then shedding it

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,640
into the air outside. And that takes a

199
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,800
lot of energy because in the summer the

200
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,279
outdoor temperature might be 90°

201
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,080
Fahrenheit or more. It's pretty hard to

202
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
shove more heat into that. Whereas if

203
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
you have a ground source heat pump,

204
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,320
you're rejecting that heat into the

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,959
ground which is actually cool because 3

206
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,399
4 m into the ground the temperature of

207
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,680
the soil is about the same the whole

208
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
year round. So in the summertime you've

209
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,600
got very cool ground into which you're

210
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,279
discharging your heat. And in the winter

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,240
time you're actually taking heat out of

212
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,120
the ground to heat up your building. So

213
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
it's cheaper even than natural gas. So

214
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,240
that's a big advantage.

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,120
On average once it's built, this kind of

216
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,320
geothermal is the cheapest way to heat

217
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,320
and cool a home. It has a catch, though.

218
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,160
If it's not installed when you're

219
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,880
building the home, then you have to do

220
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,160
some expensive and disruptive digging to

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,360
add a ground source heat pump later

222
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,600
on. So, if we can have geothermal heat

223
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,360
far away from any hot springs or

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,959
volcanoes, could we also have geothermal

225
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,200
power? Enter enhanced geothermal systems

226
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,440
or EGS.

227
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,720
The technological advances that have

228
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,920
made enhanced geothermal

229
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,600
systems suddenly the object of

230
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,320
enthusiasm have been basically borrowed

231
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,800
from oil and gas. And that's because

232
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
enhanced geothermal uses some of the

233
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,600
same techniques as fracking. You see,

234
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,160
EGS is all about making the right

235
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,640
geology for geothermal where nature

236
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
didn't provide it. So if you have a rock

237
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,959
like a big granite tombstone for

238
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,800
example, it's hard to imagine water

239
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
flowing through that. But if you

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,880
fracture it, you can actually make

241
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,680
cracks through which the water can then

242
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
pass and then recover the heat from the

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,959
the hot rock. And there are plenty of

244
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,600
places around the world where you can

245
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,519
drill to modest depths, again talking

246
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,839
about 3 km or so, and generate an

247
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,480
enhanced geothermal system. That's

248
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,800
roughly 2 miles, by the way, which you

249
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,959
might be surprised to hear is modest. 3

250
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,680
km, in fact, is kind of an everyday sort

251
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,519
of a well that gets drilled thousands of

252
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
times per year in the oil and gas

253
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,120
industry.

254
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,079
So, just like in a regular geothermal

255
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,959
power plant, an EGS project will start

256
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,200
by drilling two wells into the earth.

257
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,240
But those wells don't just go straight

258
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,720
down. Deep underground, they turn,

259
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
making a sort of Lshape. And at the

260
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,600
bottom you get two horizontal wells

261
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,480
running alongside each other. Those

262
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,279
horizontal wells are for manipulating

263
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,240
the surrounding rock. Inside them,

264
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,360
engineers use a combination of steel

265
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,000
bullets and pressurized fluid to create

266
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,920
fractures in the surrounding rock. And

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,320
the fractures kind of take off as much

268
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,720
as 500 m from the wellbor in all

269
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
directions. And in the end, you've got

270
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,279
the perfect rock for producing

271
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,519
geothermal energy. The first commercial

272
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,360
project like this just turned on in late

273
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,760
2023 and is now powering some of

274
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,560
Google's data centers in Nevada with

275
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,440
clean, renewable, and reliable energy

276
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,760
from the Earth. Already that company has

277
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,800
started drilling a new EGS project in

278
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,480
Utah that they say will be over 100

279
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,959
times larger, producing about 400

280
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,639
megawatt of electricity. That's enough

281
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:27,120
to power 400,000 homes. You know, I've

282
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,040
been following EGS systems for 50 years,

283
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,800
since

284
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,160
1975, but nobody's really made any money

285
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,480
from EGS over that whole time. And to

286
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,000
see companies now, you know, raising

287
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,920
money and going out for 400 megawatt is

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,079
very exciting,

289
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,560
which is really the scale of project

290
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,839
that we're talking about when we imagine

291
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,399
running our whole society on clean

292
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,639
energy. EGS is a young technology. It

293
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,800
may not pan out, but the current cost of

294
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
these systems is showing us that the

295
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,320
heat underground might just be as

296
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,600
affordable as coal or gas in many parts

297
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
of the world.

298
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
We actually did a study here at Stanford

299
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,760
looking at the price of electricity

300
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,800
expected from EGS systems nationwide.

301
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,600
And if we look at an average cost of

302
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,880
about $70 per megawatt hour, that's the

303
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,440
nationwide average, then geothermal is

304
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,920
competitive with that over more than

305
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
half of the United States.

306
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,720
So, we've talked a lot about clean

307
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,440
energy sources on this show, and a lot

308
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,160
of them are very exciting, but today

309
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,240
only two of them, wind and solar, are

310
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,440
both cheap enough to compete with fossil

311
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,519
fuels and possible to build in a wide

312
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,200
variety of

313
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,240
places. Is a third one waiting right

314
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,480
under our feet? One that runs around the

315
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,800
clock and provides heat for our homes

316
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,839
and our industries, too.

317
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,440
The Earth contains a positively vast

318
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,279
amount of energy, enough to power human

319
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,839
civilization hundreds of thousands of

320
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,040
times over. But it's kind of that

321
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,279
underground energy that nobody ever has

322
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,680
heard about. And I think one of the

323
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,800
things that is very encouraging right

324
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,120
now is that people are hearing about it.

325
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,720
And that gives the possibility that it

326
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,800
can move ahead in a much more

327
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,959
significant way in the near future.

328
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,120
That is our episode for today, but there

329
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,920
