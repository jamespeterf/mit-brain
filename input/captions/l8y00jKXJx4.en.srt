00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,520
Welcome to the MPG Medanox series

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,240
primer. Today um our talks next week we

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,200
have genetic therapies for rare disease

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,440
Maline Odin and we also have AI in

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,039
medicine the following week with Mah

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
Chudich

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,640
and today I'm so excited for this talk

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,840
uh illuminating variant impact with

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,000
images um and this will be given by two

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,320
people so lucky you guys uh an

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Carpenter. She earned her bachelor of

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,120
science from Purdue and her PhD from the

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,520
University of Illinois. She is a senior

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,399
director of the imaging platform and an

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,160
institute scientist here at the broad um

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,239
where she leads development of

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
open-source image analysis tools like

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,360
cell profile and the cell painting

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
assay. She also directs consortium in

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
including the jump cell painting and

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,399
oasis and is an NIH mirror investigator,

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,479
an NSF career awardee and a royal a

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,080
royale microscopia microscopical

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,960
society fellow. Um and joining her today

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,880
is uh Reni Shen. He's a posttock in the

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
carpenter singing labag and he earned

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,320
his PhD in computational biology from

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,040
Cornell studying population genetics and

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,960
evolution. Here at the broad he develops

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,280
computational methods to analyze cell

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,720
painting data uncover how genetic

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,080
varants change cellular states and also

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,320
identifies potential therapeutic

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,680
targets. Um I'm very excited for you

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,479
guys to be here. I'm excited to see all

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,799
these images. Um ask questions

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,159
throughout please. There's a hot mic

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,240
right in the middle here. You could just

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
come right up to it. If you just start

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
asking your questions from your chair,

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,079
the folks on Zoom will not hear. So,

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,479
either flag me down or come to the

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,399
microphone and let's go.

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,479
>> Thank you so much. Really happy to be

45
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,880
here to talk with this group today. I

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,479
think it's always so exciting to um to

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,479
see our technology being used in the

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
space of genomics and it's kind of a new

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,399
new direction and um just want to let

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
you know the slides are available at the

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,920
download. I think they are. Maybe we

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
forgot to upload them. Within an hour,

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
the slides will be uploaded um at that

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
location and um and you'll be able to

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,200
grab them um and or take pictures,

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,959
whatever you like. Everything can be

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,959
public here. So, we're um going to start

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,160
uh let me give you a bit of an overview

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
about what we'll talk about. I first

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
want to give some background. This is

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
the primer series. So, this is intended

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
to be more tutorial and and make sure

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
that everyone's on the same page. So, if

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,080
you know nothing about imaging, um you

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
should be in good shape. I'll explain a

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,879
bit about um how images yield single

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
cell profiles just like single cell mRNA

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,800
profiles or proteomics. Um and then

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,040
we'll talk about four different ways

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,080
that we can use this kind of image based

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
data and um and you can see here what

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,000
looking at gene function trying to

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,319
figure out disease mechanisms and do

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
drug screens and then looking at various

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,239
variant impacts and so we'll be talking

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
through that and Runi will especially be

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,800
taking over the coding variant part of

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,519
this talk. So let's get started. Um the

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,000
basic premise of us using images for

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,920
data is what if a disease cell could

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
just tell us what's wrong with it. What

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,159
if there was enough information in the

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,480
structures and the organels as their

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,360
image that could tell us that this

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,599
certain pathway is disrupted or this um

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,000
this patient has this disease or not.

87
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,159
And uh of course that must be true at

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,959
some level because we know it's true at

89
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,400
at larger scales. So, for example, if

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,720
you look at the structure of a human

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,680
face, you can often diagnose a disease

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
straight um straight from the the image.

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
And pathologists use this concept all

94
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
the time, except they zoom in a bit. Um

95
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,480
they might look at your skin and look at

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,720
a funny looking mole to see if it's

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,480
cancerous. They might zoom in to extract

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,879
cells from you and then look at their

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,959
structure because fundamentally our

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,040
biological structures tell us something

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,599
about biological functions and there's a

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,760
usually a tight correlation and often

103
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,599
diseases can be revealed in this way. So

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,400
that's the basic concept that we are

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
taking here except we are using cells

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
growing in a dish because they're much

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,599
easier to manipulate. And when we say

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,319
we're using the cell painting assay,

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,680
what I mean is we are taking cells um

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,120
either from straight from patient

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
samples or cells that have been

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
manipulated in in the dish somehow

113
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
engineered somehow to reflect a

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
particular disease. We're putting them

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,519
in culture and then we're staining them

116
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,759
with a number of different dyes that are

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,639
shown here. And these dyes are every

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
cell biologist's favorite u organels and

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
they are really informative about what

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,240
the status of a cell is. It seems like a

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,919
very simple assay and that's because it

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,240
is um it's very inexpensive. Um it's the

123
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,280
reagent cost is less than a dollar per

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,080
sample and um when we do all the image

125
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
analysis it it produces a remarkable

126
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,320
amount of information and I if you don't

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
quite believe how is that possible um I

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,320
hope to demonstrate some examples of

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
this today. So the basic kinds of

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,040
experiments that we do using cell

131
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,360
painting involve somehow preparing some

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,240
samples and those could be again patient

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,720
cell lines or genetically edited um cell

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,560
lines or they could be cells that have

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
crisper knockdown or an overexpression

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
of a gene or so on. So we prepare some

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
samples that mean something to us in the

138
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,240
context of the disease that we're

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,840
studying and then we measure everything

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
about those cells and we use image

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,120
analysis software such as cell profiler

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,960
which was um an invented

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
by my lab and here at the Broad

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,039
maintained for the past 20 years um and

145
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,639
kept up to date with all kinds of um new

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,880
algorithms that allow us to really

147
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,560
accurately identify the nucleus of the

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,720
cell or the borders of the cell from

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,919
every individual image. So we measure

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
not just how big is each object um and

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,560
we we're not just counting cells. We're

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,800
doing things like measuring the um the

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,800
the characteristics of the shape of the

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
cell gorder of the nucleus. We're

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
looking at the intensities and textures

156
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
of all the different scenes that we have

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,320
present looking at their correlations

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
and relationships as well. So we end up

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
with thousands of features for every

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,840
individual cell that has been measured

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
in the image. So we can use classical

162
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,560
techniques um in order to extract those

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,960
measurements that have some biological

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,880
meaning to us area shape and texture. We

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
can also use deep learning fe feature

166
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,560
extractors. And I won't go into detail

167
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,360
here, but the basic idea is you put in

168
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,520
the raw image of um of the pixels and

169
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,000
you allow the deep learning network to

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,400
learn what are important features that

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,080
exist within the cells maybe beyond the

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
things that biologists think about. So

173
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,039
the good news is it can capture a bit

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,639
more than our human our set of thousand

175
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
features that we typically measure with

176
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
cell profiler. Um it can capture a bit

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,960
more. The the downside is those features

178
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
are not very human interpretable. So we

179
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,000
we don't have great ways of figuring out

180
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,759
what exactly they're measuring. So

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,520
either way we end up for every

182
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
individual cell we get sort of a row of

183
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,639
this data matrix. A typical experiment

184
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,639
would have uh 10,000 times big more data

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
than is shown here because we have um

186
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,600
thousands of single cells for every

187
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,199
sample. We might have thousands of

188
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,919
samples and then we have thousands of

189
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,000
morphology features. So what do why do

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
we use imaging um and why are we so

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
excited about this as a data source is

192
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,560
because it's so much cheaper than um

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,240
mRNA and protein profiling and yet we

194
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,240
find that it has pretty similar

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
predictive success in a in a number of

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,199
different tasks that we've um attempted

197
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,599
over the past decade or so. We find that

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,759
um mRNA and images are typically equally

199
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,080
powerful protein protein profiles as

200
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
well. Um, and even more exciting is

201
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
they're complimentary, which means some

202
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,280
information you could get using either

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
technique, but there's a lot that you

204
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
can get. It's usually about a third, a

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
third, a third. Um, that a third you can

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
only get with mRNA, a third you can only

207
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,039
get with images. So, it's really nice

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
when we have multiomic um data sources

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,520
together with imaging to really capture

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,720
a lot of what is going on with a given

211
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,479
sample that we're trying to to model.

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
Okay. So this is the again the basic

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,400
concept of image profiling is we take

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
images we turn them into numbers in

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,720
single cell profiles and then we do

216
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
stuff with them and today's talk is um

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
mostly going to be about what do we do

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,039
with those um profiles we can basically

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,800
measure are these two samples similar to

220
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,639
each other or different from each other.

221
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
We can answer questions like which of

222
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,039
those features is predictive of some

223
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,000
other property that we care about about

224
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,360
the samples and so on.

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,199
Any questions so far? Um that's the

226
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,039
that's the uh the end of that little

227
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
chunk. Yeah, please.

228
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,800
>> Sorry. Thank you. Can I ask just a very

229
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,319
quick question actually? Um are are

230
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
there ways that are already defined in

231
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,039
which in which ways we can integrate

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,599
basically u the imaging data of a given

233
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,240
data set plus the mRNA or

234
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
>> ah so data integration across modalities

235
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,560
is a really fascinating problem. I think

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,200
it's a little um maybe easier to grasp

237
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
in if you're using multiple molecular

238
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
techniques but then images are just such

239
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,040
a weird data type compared you know at

240
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
least mRNA and epigenomics and um

241
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,279
proteomics they map to particular genes

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
whereas images is just a very different

243
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,399
kind of data. So very different equals

244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
great because now we have more

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,800
information but also more complicated.

246
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,120
So there's two ways um I mean there's

247
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
two classes of ways to integrate data.

248
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Um one is called early fusion and the

249
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,200
other is called late fusion. So early

250
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,600
fusion would just say, "Hey, if I've got

251
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
a certain sample and I have this many

252
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
morphology features, I'm going to just

253
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
tack on a bunch of mRNA features and a

254
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
bunch of proteomic features or

255
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
epigenomic or whatever else you have and

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,640
just put all the raw features in and you

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,399
know do whatever task you trying to do,

258
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,800
giving it access to everything kind of

259
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,279
equally. Um, and then the other approach

260
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,240
is called late fusion which is um

261
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,839
analyze each modality independently to

262
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
make some kinds of predictions and then

263
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
combine the predictions at the end. Um,

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,880
and we usually find late fusion works

265
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,399
better, but I think that's only because

266
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
um, not enough people are working on

267
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,640
this space and there's there's got to be

268
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
more clever ways of um, integrating the

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
data types earlier.

270
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
>> And and just out of curiosity, when you

271
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
say this oneird oneird oneird of

272
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,560
explaining something about the the cell

273
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,320
biology, it's using the early fusion or

274
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,360
the late fusion or

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
>> uh, that's using each of them

276
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,920
independently. Yes. So if we use them

277
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,480
independently then um then um using both

278
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,240
types independently um one or the other

279
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,000
one or the other will get a third and

280
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
then both of them will get a third of

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
the correct answers. And then you're

282
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,279
asking like what if we actually combine

283
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,079
them and integrate them. We so far have

284
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,600
not found that integrating the data does

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,279
much better than treating them both

286
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
separately. So in other words late

287
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
fusion seems to work better that

288
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
>> very complimentary.

289
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,360
>> Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

290
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
>> Yeah. Thanks for those questions.

291
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,240
Anything else before we get to the

292
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,760
actual what what are we going to do with

293
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
all these profiles?

294
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,839
>> Yeah, one question.

295
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,680
>> Sure.

296
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,839
>> Is there a sweet spot uh comparing the

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,720
imaging resolution and the imaging

298
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,640
speed?

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
>> Ah, yeah, for sure. So, it's it's

300
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,440
exactly a trade-off between how um high

301
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,040
resolution are the images and um how how

302
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
long is it sitting on the microscope and

303
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,320
that really adds up. It's actually a

304
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,079
significant cost of the assay is just

305
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,279
renting the microscope per hour if

306
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,560
you're at a place where you actually

307
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,360
have to pay for it. Um, so what we find,

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,360
um, weirdly enough, you would think the

309
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,760
higher and higher resolution go you go,

310
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,120
the better the data quality will be. It

311
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,920
turns out there really there is kind of

312
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,600
a sweet spot around 20x um, objective

313
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,000
lens is um, is pretty good. And um,

314
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
apparently going further than that, you

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,279
you get a bit more detail about what's

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
going on within the cell. At some point

317
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,560
you hit the limit of light microscopy

318
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,560
and you're not really getting anymore

319
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
anyways. Um, but I think the real issue

320
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
is that the more uh the the more you

321
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,760
zoom in on the cells, the fewer cells

322
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,839
you capture. And so, um, you have to,

323
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,600
um, you have to capture a lot more

324
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
fields of view to get the same number of

325
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
cells. And at some point, it just sort

326
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
of deteriorates. So, we found 20x to be

327
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
a really good trade-off.

328
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,399
>> Thank you. Thank you.

329
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
>> Okay. So, let's go to one of the first

330
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
applications. I want to understand

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
disease mechanisms and make a cell-based

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
functional assay for my disease. Why do

333
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,760
you want to make a cell-based assay for

334
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,880
your disease? Because then you can do

335
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
all kinds of things. You can screen

336
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
drugs. You can also do genetic

337
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
manipulations. You can try to figure out

338
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,640
what's going on um your with your

339
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,800
disease mechanisms. Okay. So, what's an

340
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,399
example of this? We have this vision of

341
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
the future where we could find a

342
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,760
cell-based phenotype for every disease

343
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
and that would be quite delightful.

344
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,320
Here's one example where you have cells

345
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,000
in a healthy state um and then cells in

346
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,079
a disease state. In this case, it was a

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,920
crisper knockdown for a loss of function

348
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,560
disorder. And you get some kind of

349
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,880
visual change. And once once that

350
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,200
happens, you can then find drugs that

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,800
reverse that disease phenotype by taking

352
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
cells that are in the disease state,

353
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,120
testing drugs one by one, and seeing, do

354
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,720
any of these drugs make the cells look

355
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,880
healthy? Again, that's a basic concept.

356
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,160
And so, here's that particular example

357
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,000
actually comes from the University of

358
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,279
Utah. And um and the the basic idea this

359
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,880
wasn't they weren't using cell painting

360
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,480
but they were using a few dyes that you

361
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,120
can see here. And when they knock down

362
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,959
this gene that causes a human genetic

363
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
disorder cerebral cavernous malf

364
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,560
formation you see a very obvious visual

365
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
change. And of course that can be

366
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,399
quantified very readily by image

367
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,560
analysis. And then they tested a bunch

368
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,320
of drugs and long story short eventually

369
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
went to clinical trials and launched

370
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
this company recursion which takes this

371
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,160
basic approach of knocking down loss of

372
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,920
function disorder genes and then um and

373
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,519
then uh screens drugs to to um repair

374
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,600
the cellular mechanisms that have gone

375
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,480
wrong with that disease. Um so they now

376
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,800
have multiple clinical trials running.

377
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
That's one example. Um another example

378
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,639
comes from Molina Clausniter's lab.

379
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
Sorry that all the um credits are are

380
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,279
covered by the um closed captioning

381
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,959
here, but um from Molina Clauser's lab

382
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,200
um they took a different approach of how

383
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,120
do we create a disease in a dish. Here

384
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,200
they took patient cells that were at

385
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,639
high risk or low risk of developing

386
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,240
metabolic disorder. So they weren't

387
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,920
necessarily experiencing symptoms

388
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,120
currently, but they had the genetics

389
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,519
that would indicate that they're going

390
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,440
to be susceptible. And that is scored by

391
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,200
a polygenic risk score. So you have high

392
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,760
and low risk patients. And they just

393
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,160
took the tails of each um took patient

394
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,720
samples um primary cells from them

395
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,360
adiposytes and then looked at at them in

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,959
the dish. And what they found is that um

397
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,639
again a very obvious difference here.

398
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,160
You can see the lipid droplets. Um they

399
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
chose to replace one of the cell

400
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,000
painting dyes with um with lipid

401
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
droplets. Um and you can see a very

402
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,920
clear difference here. Interestingly

403
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
though um they actually you don't have

404
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,600
to label the the lipid droplets

405
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
directly. uh there's enough information

406
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,279
in the other channels of cell painting

407
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,399
to have revealed this disorder. We just

408
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,000
didn't know that until we did the

409
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
experiment. So that's kind of a neat

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,959
side effect is that you don't always

411
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,160
have to stain for something obvious that

412
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
you think is going to be disease

413
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,320
related. Sometimes the data in the um in

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,680
the assay just tells you um something

415
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,000
new that you might not have realized you

416
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,000
were looking for. So those are some

417
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
examples of how we find disease

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,079
phenotypes so that we could eventually

419
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,000
do drug screens and so on. Another thing

420
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,480
you can do with images if is figure out

421
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,320
what a gene does. Yeah, please go ahead.

422
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
>> I have just one more and actually just

423
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
because of the previous slide it makes

424
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,839
me think so I know this is actually

425
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
combining polygenic information and for

426
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,800
one individual but it makes me think

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,199
about EQTLs or any sort of QTL where we

428
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,440
can actually map the effect of a variant

429
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,600
uh to a given phenotype and so is there

430
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,160
any phenotype that we can actually map

431
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,760
to snips uh in that way?

432
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,680
>> Absolutely. And that'll be this that'll

433
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,519
be the subject of like this the next

434
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,120
application after this. Exactly. Yeah,

435
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
you're you're thinking exactly the right

436
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
direction. Okay. Um so I know what this

437
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,800
gene does. I want to know what this gene

438
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
does. Um here I'm sorry I don't have a

439
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,560
ton of visuals about it, but I just want

440
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,959
to point out that we have collected a

441
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,600
ton of data that allows you to ask ask

442
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,199
answer this question for about 75% of

443
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
the genome. So if you've got a gene and

444
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,160
you don't know its function, um 13,000

445
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,680
of them we've overexpressed, 8,000 and

446
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,519
and you can't do more than that because

447
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
at some point the genes are too large to

448
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,720
express well. So that's kind of the

449
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,079
limit on overexpression. We could have

450
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,720
done more knockdown if we had more

451
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,440
funding. Um but we did 8,000 there. And

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,480
then collectively that covers about 75

453
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,000
um% of the genome as well as a ton of

454
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
small molecules. And what we did for

455
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,320
each of these, we turn up each gene,

456
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,720
turn down each gene, and then take a a

457
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,040
cell painting um set of images and

458
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,880
extract the profiles and so on. All this

459
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
data is now publicly available. This was

460
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
a large consortium with a number of

461
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
really great pharma partners who helped

462
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,720
to collect the data as well as of course

463
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
some data production here at the Broad.

464
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,959
And this is um you can you can go to

465
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,800
broad.io jump and figure out how to

466
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,480
access the entire data set if you're

467
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
computational and want to do that. But

468
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,920
we also have these interactive tools um

469
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,920
from Alon Fernando Munos Gonzalez in the

470
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,160
group. He uh postto he created some

471
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,000
tools that make it very easy to answer.

472
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,519
You know, type in your favorite gene and

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,279
you will get pictures that shows you

474
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,600
this is how the cells look when that

475
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,120
gene is knocked down or overexpressed.

476
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,880
And then it will also tell you what

477
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
other profiles are the most similar. And

478
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,920
that's super valuable because if you

479
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,079
have a gene with unknown function and

480
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,160
you find that it's highly similar to

481
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
three other genes, you can then go and

482
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,120
see what do those three other genes do?

483
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,959
what are their annotations? And it

484
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,040
starts to give you some clues, some

485
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,800
hypotheses that you might pursue for

486
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,199
your gene of interest. And it and it can

487
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,959
also answer um these tools online can

488
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
also answer what are the most

489
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,720
distinctive morphological features when

490
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,799
you knock down your gene or overexpress

491
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,959
it. So in any case where you're digging

492
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,720
into a gene um and putting together a

493
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,959
story about it, this might be a useful

494
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,160
additional piece of information to add

495
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,319
um to a paper where you can say um and

496
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,919
also the the gene is messed up in terms

497
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
of its mitochondrial shape or its

498
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
nuclear size or some other parameters.

499
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,679
And we're happy we have office hours

500
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,960
routinely at the image imaging platform

501
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,960
happy to help you interpret what do

502
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,840
those features actually mean um if

503
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,080
you're using tools like this. Yeah,

504
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,200
quick question. What um tissues or cell

505
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,360
types are?

506
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,080
>> Ah, yeah. So, this experiment was done

507
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,240
in U2OS cells. That's an osteocaroma

508
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,039
cancer cell line because it's um easily

509
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,960
cultured and grows at um densely enough

510
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,480
but also nicely flat enough to get good

511
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
measurements from. So, so far we've only

512
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,559
done one cell type with this. You can

513
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,799
imagine repeating this for a neuronal

514
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,400
cell type or hypatocytes and so on. That

515
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,400
would be quite lovely but also

516
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
expensive.

517
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,360
All right. Next we will move on to I

518
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
want to know this non-coding variance

519
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,200
impact getting to the QTL question that

520
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,280
was asked before. So here um you know in

521
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,559
my vision of of broad's future this is

522
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,039
something we've been talking about for

523
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,000
for quite a while is um we we started

524
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,160
out with a strong history in um in in um

525
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,679
sequencing genomes and it's led us to so

526
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,520
so many variants that now need

527
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,720
characterizing. So what comes next after

528
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,799
we have variance um non-coding or coding

529
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,480
and we would love to see there's so many

530
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,640
technologies at the broad cell painting

531
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,000
as well as transcrytoics and proteomics

532
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,160
can we do a full suite of

533
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,200
characterization on tons of variants in

534
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,120
parallel so that we end up with um being

535
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,960
able to at the very least classify

536
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,440
variants um we might not know what the

537
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,039
classes mean or do but at least um if

538
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
all of your variants for a disease fall

539
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,840
into three classes you can pick one from

540
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,600
each and then pursue them for example um

541
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
But it also provides us with phenotypic

542
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
insight. Sometimes we get real

543
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
mechanistic insight from looking at the

544
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
data of these different kinds of

545
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,039
profiles and eventually this hopefully

546
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,520
will lead to therapeutics.

547
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
Okay, so that's the basic concept. Um

548
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,200
most people in the room know about more

549
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,039
about QTLs than I do, but it's a locust

550
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,520
that correlates with some quantitative

551
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,440
trait. And so um those traits

552
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
historically have been gene expression,

553
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,600
the most predominant one, but they could

554
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,559
easily be cell morphology. And so we

555
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,240
worked together with a whole team um

556
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,559
that is shown here um Shomo Rajuri and

557
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,559
Raldon Name's group um and you can see

558
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,039
all the folks involved in this uh where

559
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,960
we they took um IPS-C's um and plated

560
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,400
them which is really not easy to get a

561
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
lot of cell lines growing together. So

562
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,840
it's very easy to take one cell line and

563
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
add a lot of perturbations because

564
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,720
everything's kind of consistent and so

565
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,160
on. But getting 297 cell lines to grow

566
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,679
independently but try to keep them

567
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,640
growing at the same pace so that they're

568
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
all at the same um crowdedness when it's

569
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
time to image them is is really quite a

570
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,200
challenge. But um Matt Tagmire was up to

571
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,200
this challenge and made this work to the

572
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,600
point where we then um did cell painting

573
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,679
and there was genome sequencing of these

574
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,280
same cell lines and then we just asked

575
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,440
can we take those morphology features

576
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,960
and correspond them to any particular

577
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,360
variance. And so um again the the

578
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,600
citation is right under the um captions

579
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,000
but you can download the slides later

580
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,760
and um see the paper where it goes into

581
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,919
great detail about what we found. And in

582
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,480
the end we found that these 297 cell

583
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,039
lines were just barely enough to start

584
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,679
seeing both rare and common variant um

585
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,400
associations here. We call them CMQLs

586
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,159
for cell morphology uh Q QTLs. And I

587
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
think it's because MQTTL was already

588
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,240
used for something else. I forget what

589
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,360
it is but not morphology. So um so we

590
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,520
call them CMQTLs.

591
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,960
And then lastly um the last big

592
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,039
application which I'll turn it over to

593
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,120
Renie is um having to do with coding

594
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,240
variance. So I'll start with an older

595
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,919
story from our lab where we found uh we

596
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,760
took alals that were found in lung

597
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,120
cancer. So there's sematic gen genetic

598
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,640
variation. Um, we took 353 alals that

599
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
were found in lung cancer where it

600
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
wasn't known which ones are actually

601
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,200
causal and actually really doing

602
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,000
something and which ones just happened

603
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,480
to be passenger mutations in the cancer.

604
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,240
We did cell painting and then um and

605
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,000
then the image analysis to create these

606
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
profiles and then did clustering on

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
them. And as you can see the different

608
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,840
clusters in this morphology space have

609
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,559
different phenotypes and the cells look

610
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,320
different in each one. So um in fact the

611
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,760
majority of leals actually did have a

612
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,720
phenotype. they were distinguishable

613
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,799
from negative controls and genes in

614
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,480
known pathways actually cluster with

615
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,919
each other which was another exciting

616
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,440
outcome from this and here's just

617
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,120
another way of looking at that same data

618
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,520
but just zooming in on one particular

619
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,840
gene so this is just BFF and we had a

620
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,919
dozen or so alals here and it was pretty

621
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,120
exciting because you can see the normal

622
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,039
version of BFF it's down here the marked

623
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,720
wild type um down at the bottom it

624
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,799
actually clusters with empty which is

625
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,120
our negative control here so normally

626
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,720
when you overexpress BFF the cells don't

627
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,799
you don't notice it by cell painting.

628
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,520
There's no particular um morphological

629
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,679
change. But when you overexpress

630
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,600
one of these other guys, um these are

631
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,559
all some of the the nasty driver

632
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,240
mutations for cancer. Um you see a whole

633
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,480
cluster of these guys together, but then

634
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,120
you also see a separate little cluster

635
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,280
um which are known functionally to to be

636
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,520
not constitutively activating mutations.

637
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,679
And so if you were to um it now becomes

638
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,520
possible to test every gene, every alil

639
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,400
that you could possibly get in BFF all

640
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,480
at once um cluster them like this. And

641
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,240
if your mutation in your cancer has

642
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
never been seen before, it's at least

643
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,159
useful to know does it fall into this

644
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
category and therefore might be helped

645
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,679
by medications that are useful for some

646
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
of these other guys or does it fall into

647
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,039
that category. So that's a basic

648
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,640
concept, but of course across all the

649
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,159
genes and all the variants. And so we

650
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
really love the idea of scaling this

651
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,440
kind of an experiment up to be able to

652
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,960
produce cataloges that allow us to um

653
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,520
more readily predict variant impact. And

654
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
that leads us over to Runi. So I'll hand

655
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,480
it over now.

656
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,400
>> One quick clar clarifying question

657
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,640
online. Are there enrichment libraries

658
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,960
for genes that have similar profiles

659
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,320
after they've been interfered with from

660
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
crisper?

661
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,840
Are there separate libraries of

662
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,320
>> are there enrichment libraries for genes

663
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,240
that have similar profiles after they've

664
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,880
been interfered with via crisper?

665
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,799
>> Oh um well I I'm not sure I know what

666
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,520
what is meant by enrichment libraries in

667
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,120
this context.

668
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,039
>> I think it was back when um you were

669
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,400
talking about the jump and that there

670
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
was enrichment libraries where you could

671
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,679
look up genes that were behaving

672
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,919
similarly.

673
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,520
>> Yeah. So um we have the data for the

674
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,880
whole set. And so if you type in your

675
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,559
gene name, you will get the the

676
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
rankordered list of the genes that are

677
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
most similar to your particular one. So

678
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,000
we don't have physical libraries

679
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,000
prepared like for each gene. Here's its

680
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,080
neighbors or whatever, but um but you

681
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
can see what those genes are and then

682
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,440
you know hand cherry pick a library as

683
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,960
you like. Yeah.

684
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,880
>> Is there anything else online?

685
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,480
>> Um no, that was it. And feel free to

686
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,280
clarify that question Jared if that

687
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
wasn't correct.

688
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,760
>> This is Pam. Can you hear me? I actually

689
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,919
have one question about jump data. Um,

690
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,039
how transferable are the like expression

691
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,960
or knockout findings from the U2 O2

692
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,400
cells to other cell lines? I mean, I

693
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,559
guess it depends on the gene, but do

694
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,679
main features of the cells change in a

695
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,600
similar way in in different

696
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,600
>> Yeah, I'm I'm glad you asked this

697
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,039
question because you everybody would be

698
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,320
quite right to be a little skeptical

699
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,840
like gh what's the point, you know, you

700
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,240
knock down and overexpress these genes

701
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,400
in a single cell type. Um, but that's

702
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,799
really unfortunate because I study

703
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,240
neurons or um a liver disease or

704
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,159
something else and like how what are the

705
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,679
chances this random bone cancer cell

706
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
line is going to have the right

707
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,320
phenotypes. And I guess the reassurance

708
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,919
that I have um so of course sometimes

709
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,679
you will not see a phenotype in this

710
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,840
cell line whereas you would if you used

711
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,159
a more specific cell type. But as

712
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,400
reassurance that it's not hopeless, um

713
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,320
we actually find that um something like

714
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,559
um I'm sorry I don't remember exactly,

715
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,960
but something like 30 to 40% of human

716
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,880
genes when knocked down or overexpressed

717
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,799
produce a phenotype in the cell line

718
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,200
with the cell painting assay. So 30 to

719
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,000
40% is not bad coverage um for a single

720
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,960
very inexpensive assay. Um and we also

721
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,840
find that something like 70% of FDA

722
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,159
approved drugs um actually produce a

723
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,080
phenotype in a single cell line. those

724
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,919
FDA approved drugs are for all kinds of

725
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,720
different disorders and so we are

726
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,200
capturing a broad spectrum of of biology

727
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,440
that is in many cases conserved from one

728
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,159
cell type to another. Um so we h we

729
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,320
certainly have specific examples of um

730
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,520
brain diseases where we see a phenotype

731
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,200
in a random um epithelial cell line. Um

732
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,039
so it's it's not it is definitely not

733
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
hopeless. In fact, more often than not,

734
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,360
we really do see things in the quote

735
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,640
wrong cell type for a given disease. So

736
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,480
it's at least worth a shot. It's low

737
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
hanging fruit. it's worth a shot. Um,

738
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
but we would love to also be expanding a

739
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,400
lot of these experiments to fancier cell

740
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
types.

741
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,000
>> Okay. Uh, cool. Well, uh, first thank

742
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,159
you Dr. Cover for a excellent overview

743
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
of how we can use a cell painting essay

744
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
to tackle all different kinds of

745
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,480
biological problems in general and also

746
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,159
in the genetic research which also sets

747
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,159
perfect stage to what I'm going to talk

748
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,720
about next. But before I start it, I

749
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,360
just want to express my thanks to both

750
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,080
the organizer today and also my PI for

751
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,679
having me here and also it's a pleasure

752
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,200
to be here today and then present my

753
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,279
work at the MPG primer series. Cool. So

754
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
going forward from Dr. cover has just

755
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,120
talked about regarding how we can use

756
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,360
the cell painting essays to decode those

757
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,440
coding variants. I'm going to dive into

758
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,520
a specific project where instead of

759
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
focusing on specific variants in a

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
disease or a single gene, we're trying

761
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,440
to capture and test the functional

762
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,000
impact of thousands of variants at the

763
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,720
same time. So this is actually a part of

764
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,880
the var initiative funded by the NIH

765
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,520
where we're aiming to characterize the

766
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,240
functional impact of more than 30,000

767
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
genetic variants across more than 2,000

768
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,360
rare disease genes across a whole human

769
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,000
mandelian protein. And the idea behind

770
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,159
this is because in the genetic research

771
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,320
right now even though we have found so

772
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
many different associations between the

773
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,200
varants and the disease phenotypes we

774
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,039
have limited knowledge about how these

775
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,360
variance is impacting the disease in

776
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,679
different biological mechanisms. And the

777
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
idea of our project is to use multiple

778
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,440
different kinds of essays to give a

779
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,840
comprehensive picture of the functional

780
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,000
impact of this variants. So here we're

781
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,400
doing a lot of different tasks like

782
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,320
we're doing this protein stability essay

783
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,880
to test whether the protein will be

784
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,799
degraded or not after mutation and we're

785
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,240
using protein protein interaction essays

786
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,840
to detect how the protein protein

787
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,720
interaction is going to be disturbed

788
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,799
after mutation and of course we're also

789
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,880
going to do a lot of imaging stuff as I

790
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,480
will talk about today and eventually the

791
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,640
idea is that we use all these different

792
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,320
kinds of essays to give a comprehensive

793
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,240
picture of the functional impact of

794
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,559
different variants and then combine them

795
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,640
with some kind of AI predictor such as

796
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,840
alpha miss sense to predict those

797
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
missations effect and then use our essay

798
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,520
to help us understand the biological

799
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,360
mechanisms underlying those predicted

800
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,520
variants and see if we can understand

801
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,679
those understand them in a better way.

802
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,440
So as you can see here so far in this

803
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,480
project specifically we have profiled

804
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,880
more than 1,000 variants variants across

805
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,960
the whole thing and if we look at the

806
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,799
clinical var annotations of all these

807
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
variants we can see that more than a

808
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,039
quarter of them have no clear clinical

809
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,279
annotation regarding their clinical

810
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,880
significance which basically leave all

811
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,480
the doctors and the patients who are

812
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,799
diagnosed with this variant to be

813
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,760
uncertain about their diagnosis. At the

814
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,480
same time, even though more than 50% of

815
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,120
them are pathogenic, we still have no

816
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,200
idea most of them are doing with

817
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,200
regarding their pathogenicity.

818
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
So in this case, using our imaging

819
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,520
essay, we can detect their phenotype

820
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,120
such as protein misloization, which is a

821
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,760
very nice representation of their

822
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,360
biological function. For instance, in

823
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,520
one of our pilot study conducted by

824
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,960
Tapoli lab at the University of Toronto,

825
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,039
we find some mutation from the LZTR1

826
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,799
gene which had a very prominently

827
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,039
different phenotypes compared to their

828
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,360
reference. And this variant is actually

829
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,120
assoc associated with a rare disease

830
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,080
called non syndrome which typically

831
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,760
happens in the babies where it stops the

832
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,159
typical development of different human

833
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,919
bodies. And after such phenotypes has

834
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,600
been identified, we can then use

835
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,360
different drug screening to find the

836
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,720
drugs that can reverse the phenotype

837
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,720
backs to their original state.

838
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,960
And in this specific project, we

839
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,279
actually optimize our essay to capture

840
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,799
the protein localization better. Unlike

841
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,799
the traditional cell painting essay

842
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,880
where we use five different channels to

843
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,640
capture the general cell structure, we

844
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,799
actually replace one of the channel with

845
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,360
a green fluoresence protein where we can

846
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,200
attack the protein of target and then

847
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
using the other three channel to capture

848
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
the general morphology of the cells in

849
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,200
general. So in this case we can use this

850
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,279
variant painting essay to capture both

851
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
the protein localization effect as well

852
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,720
as cell morphology to give us a more

853
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,159
comprehensive picture of the cell

854
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,559
phenotypes after mutation happens.

855
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,480
And in our general workflow uh both

856
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,640
experimentally and computationally in

857
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,600
this project is that first we're going

858
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,720
to overexpress a single al either its

859
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,120
variant or its uh reference alo in on

860
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,600
the U2 cells and then put them into

861
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,200
hundreds of different 384 well plates.

862
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,960
After that we're going to stain each

863
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,960
cell with different type of stains that

864
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,279
we get from the variant painting essay

865
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,760
and then take the microscopic images of

866
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,679
each cell in there. And then we will do

867
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,640
the computational analysis where we use

868
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,720
cell profiler to do this imaging uh

869
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
image segmentation to help us identify

870
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,760
each single cell in there and then

871
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,520
extract all these different features

872
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,840
like Dr. Cumber has just talked about

873
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,760
regarding their counts, shapes, size,

874
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,760
textures and all this stuff. So

875
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,919
eventually this will leads us to about

876
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,559
2,000 features per each cell for our

877
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,720
downstream analysis.

878
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,640
And with all this informative cell

879
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,960
morphology and protein localization

880
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,039
features, we then develop an automated

881
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,200
machine learning framework to detect if

882
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,200
the variant cells have any protein

883
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,440
misoization effect or alter cell

884
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,760
morphology. And the hardest part with

885
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,679
this problem is that even though we're

886
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,919
able to use such kind of framework to

887
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,600
detect whether a varied cell is

888
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,360
different from the reference cells, it's

889
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,679
very hard for us to tell if it's from

890
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,000
simple techn technological confounding

891
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,360
factors such as well position effect or

892
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,440
some microscopic lining conditions. And

893
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,559
to address this issue, we train this

894
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,200
extra boost classifier to basically

895
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,000
train the cell train the classifier

896
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,320
using the single cell profiles from the

897
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,720
from the same alals from different

898
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,559
control imaging wells as well as using

899
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
the different alals from different

900
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,440
wells. And then we're going to use the

901
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,600
AOC metric of this classifier as a

902
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,279
surrogate to describe how different the

903
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,080
single cell profiles are from different

904
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,240
al pairs or well pairs. In this case, if

905
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,240
it's a higher ARC, means that our

906
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,679
classifier is able to learn the

907
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,519
distinguished features between the

908
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,519
variant and the reference, which means

909
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,840
that there is a more significant effect

910
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,799
of protein misloization or changing cell

911
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,720
morphology. And in order to address the

912
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,200
technical variations we observe due to

913
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,200
wellposition effect or uh the lighting

914
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,240
conditions, we actually use the

915
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,399
distribution of the AOC that we obtained

916
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,159
from training the classifier on the same

917
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,200
web pairs but from different imaging

918
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,840
walls. and then use the 15 the 95th

919
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,919
percentile of the ARC as the cutoff for

920
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,159
us to call the significant hits of

921
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,880
either protein misloization and alter

922
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,960
cell morphology

923
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,080
and using this method we're able to

924
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,240
identify more than 43% of the genes that

925
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,240
we have profiled so far have at least

926
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,320
one variant that cause a significant

927
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,000
protein misloization which leads to

928
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,720
about 15 15% of variants in total as

929
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,440
well as about 2% of the variants a

930
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,480
significant change in cell morphology.

931
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,360
Since the AOC profile is a continuous

932
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,880
metric to describe the the degree of

933
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
difference between the variant and the

934
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,880
reference, we can actually see that in

935
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
the protein misloization profiling

936
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,440
specifically all the pathogenic variants

937
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,679
are much more likely to cause protein

938
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,840
misloization than the benign variants

939
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,399
where the conflicting variants and the

940
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,640
VS variants where we have no idea what

941
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,399
their clinical significance exactly is

942
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,799
sitting between the benign and and the

943
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,960
pathogenic. But our ability to detect

944
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,679
the cell morphology right now is is not

945
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,679
so distinguishable as we can detect the

946
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,519
protein localization. And we're still

947
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,240
working on this to make it uh better in

948
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,480
the future.

949
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,200
And when we're examining the protein

950
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,360
structure for uh when we observe all

951
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,840
these variants, we also observe that all

952
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,919
the variants that happened within the

953
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,919
core of the protein show higher mis

954
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,320
localization than the surface exposed

955
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,320
variants which can be captured by the so

956
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,359
relative solvent accessibility matrix

957
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,359
where we can see that all the var in the

958
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,359
protein core have much much higher

959
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,119
misoization score than the protein that

960
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,000
is on the protein surface. And to

961
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,480
visualize this in a very nice uh 3D

962
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,639
structure from a example protein called

963
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,720
factor 9, we can also see that all the

964
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,560
variants that are misloized are more

965
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,320
likely to be contained within the

966
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,200
protein core rather than on the protein

967
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,200
surface.

968
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,760
So after we have identified all this

969
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,919
misloized variants, the next natural

970
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,440
question will be where do this variant

971
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,639
move the protein. So in some cases the

972
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,240
direction of movement is very

973
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,919
straightforward. basically move the

974
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,320
protein from one cellular compartment to

975
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,879
the other like we are showing here using

976
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,040
the example of the rodopsin protein

977
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,599
which the mutations in this protein is

978
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,800
very so is very closely related to

979
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,960
disease like night night blindness and

980
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,040
in this case when we're using the cell

981
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
profiler features to analyze the protein

982
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,880
collocicalization patterns we can

983
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,880
observe that there is a significant

984
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,480
increase in protein collocicalization

985
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,040
between the GFP channel and the

986
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,720
mitochondria channel in the cytoplasm

987
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,119
As well as when we're looking at the

988
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,359
images, we can we can also observe the

989
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,440
same trend of this gradient of change

990
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,280
between the variants corresponds to

991
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280
exactly the feature we observe on the on

992
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,599
the left hand side where initially in

993
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,760
the reference we see the protein is miso

994
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,160
is localized generally in the plasma

995
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,640
membrane. Well, in the protein where we

996
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,520
have the the proline to therronine we

997
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,760
have the kind of least misoization from

998
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,000
the the plasma membrane to cytoplasm.

999
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,160
Well, in the last case in the cyine to

1000
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,480
tyrrosine, we have the most strongest

1001
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,040
significant effect of misoquization into

1002
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,640
cytoplasm. And even though all the four

1003
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,640
variants that we have shown here has

1004
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,119
been annotated at pathogenic variants in

1005
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,920
cleanar only one of them which is the

1006
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,320
cyst to tarning has been annotated with

1007
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,960
the function of er retention in previous

1008
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,000
literature literature'ses. However, with

1009
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,079
our assay right now, we can identify the

1010
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,599
exact functional impact of more variants

1011
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,880
and annotate them with similar

1012
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,839
functional impact.

1013
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,079
But however, in a lot of cases, not all

1014
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,640
the variance impact can be visually see

1015
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,440
exactly. So a lot of the patterns that

1016
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,680
we observe can only be detected by cell

1017
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,400
profiler features such and using the

1018
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,640
unbiased quantitative matrix to evaluate

1019
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,800
how this protein or how this variant

1020
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,920
changed the misoization pattern of a

1021
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,720
protein. For instance here uh take the

1022
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,880
example of this CCM2 gene which is known

1023
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,320
to be associated with the vascular

1024
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,720
malfunction in the central nervous

1025
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,560
system. We have profiled more than a 100

1026
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,359
variants in this gene and successfully

1027
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,160
detect the top seven most significant

1028
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,480
misloization uh misloized variants of

1029
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,400
this gene and even there are only seven

1030
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,320
of them there are they are forming three

1031
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,960
different types of patterns of

1032
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,200
misloization for this specific gene in

1033
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,320
the first cluster we observe that there

1034
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,720
is a significant increase of the protein

1035
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,640
collocicalized with the DNA channel and

1036
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,200
also in the nucleus which means that the

1037
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,079
protein is more the protein varants

1038
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,480
cause a more localization in the nuclei

1039
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,960
than the reference. And in the second

1040
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,720
cluster, we observe the same thing of

1041
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,720
increased protein expression in the

1042
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,480
nucleus, but we also observe a

1043
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,880
significant decrease in expression in

1044
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,280
the cytoplasm compared to the reference.

1045
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,839
Well, in the third cluster, we observe a

1046
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,160
different patterns of specific protein

1047
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,119
spatial expression at the edge of the

1048
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,800
cytoplasm. In general,

1049
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,560
when we're looking at visualize

1050
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,560
everything into a cell painting

1051
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,640
pictures, we can also see that in

1052
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,240
general in the CCM2 reference gene, it

1053
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,119
is localized in the mitochondria and

1054
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,960
mostly in the cytoplasm. But the first

1055
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,040
cluster we identified is actually

1056
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,839
misloized this protein from the

1057
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,400
cytoplasm into the nucleus. While the

1058
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,800
second cluster which is a mutations

1059
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,040
happen at the start codon is having a

1060
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,880
dramatic effect. Well, instead of moving

1061
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,359
the nucle moving the protein from the

1062
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,599
cytoplasm to the nucleus, it only

1063
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,000
present the protein in the nuclei but

1064
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,079
not the cytoplasm anymore. And in the

1065
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,920
third cluster, even though visually we

1066
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,240
cannot tell the exact difference between

1067
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,000
the images from the variant versus the

1068
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,079
reference, we can still use the

1069
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,560
distribution of the subprofiler features

1070
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,880
to see that the texture of the protein

1071
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,960
expression in the nucle in the cytoplasm

1072
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,440
as well as the expression of the protein

1073
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,359
at the edge of cytoplasm is much higher

1074
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,800
in the reference than the than the

1075
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:42,560
variant. And the peculiar case with the

1076
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,640
last val 53 to is uh to the isolucine

1077
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,200
example is that this variant is actually

1078
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,560
a benign variant on the clean bar and it

1079
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,880
had it had about 6% of population

1080
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,119
frequency in the caucasian population.

1081
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,000
However, in our studies, we find that

1082
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,920
this variant is actually is going to

1083
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,880
increase the risk in the central nervous

1084
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,040
system related CCM2 diseases which shows

1085
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,200
that different variant is actually going

1086
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,320
to have different cell type and also

1087
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,839
disease type effect that going to have

1088
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,880
even though the functional impact will

1089
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,880
be the same the eventual results of this

1090
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,920
variant in dise in different disease

1091
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,760
context will be very different.

1092
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,079
And the last one I'm going to show is to

1093
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,000
show that our cell cell painting essay

1094
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,720
is actually going to show reveal more

1095
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,560
details regarding different patterns of

1096
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,880
uh this localization change than other

1097
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,400
some kind of essays. And in this as in

1098
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
this specific study, we're collaborating

1099
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,320
with our collaborator from the uh

1100
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,480
University of Washington where they

1101
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
focus on a specific gene called a factor

1102
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,160
9 protein which I also showed the

1103
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,800
protein structure previously. And in

1104
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,760
this protein they focus on they use a

1105
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,839
multiplex essay where they can hyperput

1106
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,760
capturing the functional impact of

1107
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,440
different variants of this protein on

1108
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,599
the scale of thousand of variant at the

1109
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,440
same time and they focus on the protein

1110
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,359
secretion and the post-transational

1111
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,960
modification of this protein because

1112
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,960
these are the necessary functions for

1113
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,920
this protein to stop bleeding and also

1114
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,920
achieve hemostasis in the human bodies.

1115
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,320
And when we are comparing our imaging

1116
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,240
results with the protein secretion essay

1117
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,240
and their post-transational modification

1118
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,280
essay, we can see that both our

1119
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,800
misloization scores have very strong

1120
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
correlation with either protein

1121
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,880
secretion and also their post

1122
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,280
translational modification essays.

1123
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Especially most variants with very low

1124
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,920
protein secretion also showed a very

1125
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,760
high misloization score. However, we

1126
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,480
also do see that there is still kind of

1127
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,560
limitation of our imaging essay where we

1128
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,040
could not exactly detect the

1129
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,000
post-transational modification of these

1130
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,520
two glue 73 variants with normal protein

1131
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,880
secretion which also it's showcased that

1132
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,960
we also need to have a more

1133
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,960
comprehensive picture like we did in the

1134
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,119
varian project to use different types of

1135
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,680
essay to to characterize the functional

1136
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,160
impact of different proteins.

1137
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,920
But even though we have very nice

1138
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,839
correlation between our score with the

1139
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,920
protein secretion scores, we still

1140
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,680
detect two different patterns of protein

1141
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,839
misoization.

1142
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,000
For example, the one that happened at

1143
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,880
the signal peptide sequence of the F9

1144
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,040
protein, the CIS 28 arch is actually

1145
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,200
having a very different protein

1146
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,760
misloization phenotype than the other

1147
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,160
detected misloized variants where there

1148
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,160
is more shift in the protein expression

1149
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,240
in the nucleus where all the other

1150
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,720
variants mostly only shift the protein

1151
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,440
expression in the cytoplasm which shows

1152
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,040
that our essay can review more

1153
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,040
biological details and higher

1154
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,599
granularity of the biolog biological

1155
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,400
information compared to simply a protein

1156
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,720
secretion essay.

1157
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,319
And with all that being said, uh the

1158
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,480
eventual goal of this project is

1159
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,480
actually to construct a comprehensive

1160
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,480
cell map or variant map of different

1161
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,400
types of variants across all the

1162
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,720
different genes and then we can help

1163
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,880
people uh curate everything online using

1164
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,640
our portal to see what are the common

1165
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,400
common features or the differential

1166
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,839
features among different variants,

1167
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,359
different genes in different disease

1168
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,800
contexts. uh which is going to be which

1169
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,280
going to be public after we have

1170
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,119
profiled all the 30,000 variants but

1171
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,319
still for now uh thanks to the

1172
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,000
generosity of doc and leasita our

1173
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,480
collaborator at the Washington

1174
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,960
University of Washington we also publish

1175
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,040
our current 1000 variants mis

1176
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,119
localization score onto their mdb

1177
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,119
database where you can simply go on

1178
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,880
there and search for the variants or the

1179
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,200
gene that you're of your interest and

1180
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
then look at the morphological uh

1181
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,920
alterology score or misloization score

1182
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,319
on the gene of your interest and feel

1183
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,520
free to contact us regarding the images

1184
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,680
of those variants as well.

1185
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,760
So after we have identified all these

1186
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,680
variants and their functional impact uh

1187
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,760
like Dr. Cover just showed the next

1188
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,839
natural steps will be to find the drugs

1189
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,880
that can reverse those phenotypes. And

1190
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,040
so far, combined with our current var

1191
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,680
study as well as a pilot study, we have

1192
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,800
profiled more than 40, and 500 human

1193
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,520
genetic variants across 250 disease

1194
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,560
phenotypes. And we're very excited to

1195
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,760
further extend this initiative by not

1196
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,240
only finding more uh finding the other

1197
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,560
30,000 new variants as well as

1198
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,400
establishing a consortium called Vista

1199
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,560
where we're partner up with the people

1200
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,960
from the pharmaceutical industry to see

1201
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,599
if they can found interesting drug that

1202
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,040
can be repurposed to just cure this

1203
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,560
disease or reverse the phenotype

1204
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,200
directly.

1205
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,599
And to just show you guys the concept of

1206
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,119
reversing drug of reversing the disease

1207
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,960
phenotypes using drugs is going to be

1208
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,280
successful. We are showing this two

1209
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,800
example here where successful drugs can

1210
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,520
actually reverse the disease

1211
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,920
misloization. On the top here we have

1212
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,040
the premature aging disease called

1213
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,560
progeria where the initial protein

1214
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,119
expression of the lemon is kind of like

1215
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,440
speckly in the in the in the cell but

1216
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,440
when a mutation happen it will lose its

1217
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,240
speckly expression in the cell and makes

1218
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,800
the nuclear a little bit blabby but the

1219
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,960
blockbuster drug lenaparnep is actually

1220
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,119
able to reverse the phenotype and then

1221
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,520
make it more looking like its original

1222
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,920
healthy status. The other example at the

1223
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,319
bottom is the CFTR protein in the cystic

1224
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,319
fibrosis where the protein is in

1225
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,119
initially localized in the plasma

1226
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,359
membrane. It's not in this CF disease.

1227
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,440
However, the blockbuster drug from the

1228
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,520
Vertex is actually able to push the

1229
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,200
protein back into its original plasma

1230
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,520
membrane disease, plasma membrane

1231
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,000
localization and kind of help the

1232
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,240
patient to have a speed recovery from

1233
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,400
the disease and then even extend the

1234
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,599
lifespan of this cystic fibrosis patient

1235
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,480
to their 60s right now.

1236
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,720
And even more, in order to accelerate

1237
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,720
and also scale up the experiments more

1238
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,960
efficiently, we're actually adopting a

1239
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,800
new technology called full image based

1240
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,280
profiling developed by Bleini Lab and

1241
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,599
Neil JT Newslab at the Broad Institute.

1242
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,440
In this case, instead of doing an array

1243
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,920
format where in each imaging wall, we

1244
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,400
only have one specific variant tested,

1245
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,319
we're actually going to put thousands,

1246
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,040
tens of thousands of variant in a single

1247
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,760
imaging wall as long uh along with a

1248
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,079
specific FDA approved compound. And in

1249
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,440
each of the single wells, it can express

1250
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,280
either one of the 400 possible genals

1251
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,520
that we're going to test in there. And

1252
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,839
in order to deconvolute the cell

1253
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,640
morphological change or localization

1254
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,640
pattern of each single cell, we can use

1255
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,680
a s in situal barcoding to help us using

1256
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,760
simple microscope to identify which cell

1257
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,839
have carry which type of specific

1258
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,240
variants and then use that to help us

1259
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,560
efficiently detect whether for this drug

1260
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,319
treatment in this wall how many variants

1261
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,400
can be successfully reverted to their

1262
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,200
original phenotype. And in this case, it

1263
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,359
will help us speed up the whole process

1264
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,839
of drug repurposing in a much faster

1265
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,560
fashion.

1266
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,720
And in the end, I hope you have enjoyed

1267
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,160
a full journey of how we can use cell

1268
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,319
printing essay to tackle different

1269
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,880
biological problems as well as its

1270
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,880
application in the genetic research. But

1271
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,720
other than we have talked about before,

1272
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,040
there are still a lot of different kinds

1273
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,599
of other applications of cell painting

1274
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,680
such as we can use them to identify the

1275
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,760
MOA of different drug compounds uh

1276
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,480
predict the drug toxicity of target

1277
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,800
effect side effects and even use it to

1278
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,880
stratify patient with uh for more

1279
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,400
precision medicine. At the same time,

1280
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,800
there are also a lot of questions that

1281
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,800
are pending to answer such as can we

1282
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,640
speed up the process in this experiment

1283
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,280
or computational pipeline using

1284
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,920
automation, a clever biotech or maybe

1285
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,520
some AI agent and can we surpass the

1286
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,520
human capabilities of understanding

1287
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,440
those images using deep learning models

1288
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,839
to help us extract more meaningful

1289
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,160
biological context or insight for

1290
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,079
different downstream tasks. And if you

1291
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,160
are interested in looking into our

1292
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,560
research a little bit more, you can also

1293
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,560
refer to all the nice review papers we

1294
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,560
have published in the recent years and

1295
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,720
then talk to us afterwards as well. And

1296
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,880
you can find our slide deck here on the

1297
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,200
on the bottom of the link here. But in

1298
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,359
the end, our hope is that collectively

1299
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,520
we want this kind of technology as well

1300
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,920
as all the other kinds of AI innovations

1301
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,319
in the drug development can help us

1302
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,640
break the curve and then cut the cost

1303
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,560
and the time for drug development and to

1304
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,440
develop better drugs to treat more human

1305
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,200
diseases.

1306
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,640
And last but not least, we would like to

1307
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,560
thank uh all our lab members for all the

1308
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,119
work they have done so far and also our

1309
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,520
collaborators especially the image an

1310
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,839
analyst in the best simul also in the

1311
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,440
uproad imaging platform without their

1312
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,400
effort none of this project will be

1313
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,119
possible and also our amazing fund uh

1314
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,040
funding resources as well uh without all

1315
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,440
these people and all this money I don't

1316
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,040
think we can achieve anything here. So,

1317
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,280
with that all being said, we also have

1318
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,839
our uh contact info here at the bottom

1319
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,599
and also uh here again the slide link.

1320
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,240
Feel free to contact us and look at the

1321
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:04,760
slides afterwards and we're free to take

1322
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,760
any questions you have. Thank you.

1323
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,599
>> Um this is Pam online. I have a

1324
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:13,040
question.

1325
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,160
>> Um yeah. Um so, Nunan syndrome, it's

1326
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,240
part of a spectrum of

1327
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,240
neurodedevelopmental disorders. So there

1328
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,920
are several other genes that cause it

1329
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,680
and some other um

1330
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,280
other genes that cause nunin as well as

1331
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,119
like related syndromes. Um I'm guessing

1332
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,960
this hasn't been done yet but have have

1333
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,280
any of these other genes been tested in

1334
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,640
the and seen the same to like replicate

1335
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,920
the uh findings with LDTR1 because

1336
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
>> that's a great Yeah, that's a great

1337
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,839
question. I think we've only looked at

1338
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,119
that one variant so far. So I love the

1339
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,000
question but I don't know the answer.

1340
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,960
Yeah,

1341
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
>> you showed a couple examples of um cases

1342
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,920
where something in some gene change

1343
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,240
leads to some self morphology change,

1344
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,559
but I'm wondering if um you know of any

1345
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,880
examples where there's a cell morphology

1346
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,760
change, but at the tissue level, it's

1347
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,640
not clear what's going on. And um so I

1348
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,960
it's like a negative case of using self

1349
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,280
painting

1350
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,040
>> like where where there is a change at

1351
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,240
the cellular level but it's not seen at

1352
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,520
the tissue level is

1353
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,520
>> yeah or where um it's clear what's going

1354
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,280
on in the cell at the cell level but at

1355
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,240
the tissue level it becomes unclear

1356
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,319
what's actually going.

1357
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,000
>> No we have we have not done most of what

1358
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,359
we've done so far has been really high

1359
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,280
throughput like looking at thousands of

1360
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,079
variants at once. So we have not um

1361
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,319
followed up on very many things um at at

1362
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,000
the tissue or organism level. So it's

1363
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,240
it's a great question. I think that if

1364
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,160
if you found some I mean we're just sort

1365
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,359
of generating all these hypotheses. I

1366
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,119
think if you found something that looked

1367
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,359
interesting that would be a fantastic

1368
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,960
question to go and follow it up.

1369
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,119
>> Thank you for your wonderful talk. I

1370
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,680
just have a basic questions is out of

1371
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,000
curiosity when you do the model training

1372
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,280
and decide whether there's um protein

1373
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,119
mis localization comparing the the cells

1374
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,920
with the mutation and the reference

1375
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,480
cells have you compare or did you

1376
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,160
compare the cells have similar genetic

1377
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,800
background say like polygenic score

1378
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,240
using this kind of score decide whether

1379
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,559
these two cell uh the the cell with

1380
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,319
mutation and the cell with the reference

1381
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,240
uh the reference cells have similar

1382
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,319
similar genetic background overall

1383
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,440
generally speaking and then do the

1384
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,920
comparation to decide whether it is the

1385
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,760
protein misloization.

1386
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. So the the cells in both

1387
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,680
cases are exactly the same. They're

1388
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,599
cultured cells. So they're you know as

1389
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,960
identical as as cultured cells can be

1390
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,800
over time. So we're we're putting

1391
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,960
separate samples in different wells and

1392
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,079
we're overexpressing the protein. These

1393
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,599
are only coding variants. So we're

1394
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,839
overexpressing the protein with and

1395
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,079
without the mutation. Um so it's not at

1396
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,599
the endogenous locus. um I think is what

1397
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,440
you're you're getting at. Yeah. So the

1398
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,839
genetic background is identical and it's

1399
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,520
the only intervention is add a protein

1400
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,400
with or without the mutation.

1401
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,319
>> Got it. Thank you.

1402
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,240
>> All right. Let's thank our speaker one

1403
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,920
more time. Speakers,

1404
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,240
>> thank you.

1405
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,400
>> Um good news. You don't have to move.

1406
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,160
Just refill your coffee and stick around

1407
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,640
for the seminar. Thank you everybody.

1408
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,640
See you next week.
