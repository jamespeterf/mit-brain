1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,360
All right. So, my name is Leslie Miller

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,639
Nicholson. I have the privilege of being

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,880
I think I can walk away. Um, the

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
executive director of MIT's technology

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
licensing office. I've been in that

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
position for nine and a half years.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,279
Previously, I was responsible for the

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,599
same sort of stuff way out in the

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,560
Midwest. uh University of Illinois in

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,160
Champ Champagne Orbana that does also

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,960
does some wonderful research. So today

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,960
what am I going to be talking about?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Um technology transfer in a university

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,000
environment is a lot of things. Um it is

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
teaching and service. It is graduating

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
students taking their knowledge into

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
companies. It is research and

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,920
publication, sponsored research, faculty

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,239
consulting, and then it's the stuff that

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,960
offices like the TLO, the technology

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,040
licensing office do, which is licensing

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,799
to startups and other companies. And

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,799
that's what I'm going to talk about

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,799
today.

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,600
So,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
what I'm going to do is just go through

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,439
some basic tenants of what tech transfer

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
is, what it looks like, how we do it,

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,040
and

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,960
dive into some of the things that you

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,200
might not be aware of because there's

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,159
some really cool stuff that happens

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,759
through offices like the TLLLO, but the

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
other stuff isn't actually ever

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,880
mentioned. And that's what some of the

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,600
stuff I want to highlight. So, in every

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,880
research university in the United States

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,720
and across the world, there is likely a

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,479
a tech transfer office. They may call

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
themselves something different. And it

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,040
is likely that their structure is going

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,240
to look something like this. And in the

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,840
case of MIT's which is literally just

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,040
next door we have 50 staff and it falls

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,320
into these five buckets of work. Case

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,840
intake sponsor compliance which I'll

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,720
talk about fundamental HR IT

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
infrastructure database management and

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
that falls under the bucket of

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,800
operations. We also have what people

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,040
most commonly know about and talk about

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
which is licensing. That cool stuff,

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,200
that really cool stuff that people do.

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
The case management, the engagement with

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,239
faculty, the engagement with sponsors,

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,239
engagement with lences, business

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,720
development, and all of the things that

58
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,360
go alongside that. And then there's

59
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,959
faculty, I mean, financial and equity

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
administration. You see, I'm not even

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
using my notes, so there's a huge chance

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,120
that I'm not going to talk about

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,599
anything on my 12 pages here.

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,440
Um just make sure that I you know give

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
you value for money and cover something

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,680
that I said I would talk about. Um

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,480
finance and equity management. The

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
offices like ours um do a number of

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,599
different transactions. Many of them are

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,360
with law firms to pay bills for the

71
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,239
patent protection that they're doing on

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,720
our behalf. Others are lences paying us

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
money. Others are related to equity that

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
we might take in small startup

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,280
companies. And therefore that workflow

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,959
that funds flow has to be managed by

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,599
someone. So there's always a small

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,440
financial team supporting that work. And

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
then there's the intellectual property.

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,560
And in the case of MIT, our office also

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
manages MIT's trademark. So if any of

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,720
you have anything on you that says MIT

83
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,120
on it, we license that to the vendor

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
that you bought that from. And the

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
revenue that actually comes in from

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,080
that, this is not in my notes, but it

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,599
might be interesting, actually goes back

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,280
to uh student and athletics programs. It

89
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,599
goes immediately back because it is

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,000
effectively MIT's name and brand on

91
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,080
branded stuff. But we manage that in

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
addition to the other IP stuff that

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
you're very familiar with. It's to do

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
with patents, filings, protection,

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,920
assignments. All of those pieces are

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,720
handled through the IP team. and then um

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,720
marketing and communications who help in

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
the messaging and communication

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,400
including some of these really cool

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,640
slides you're about to see about the

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,599
research that's going on the IP that we

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,280
are trying to protect and um all of the

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,880
other activities. I'm just going to move

104
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,840
a couple of things on this because it's

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,840
driving me a little nuts. Here we go to

106
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,919
organize myself. Just talk amongst

107
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,880
yourselves.

108
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,360
All right. One area of activity that is

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,759
actually dispersed across the MIT

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,120
community but in other universities is

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,720
often done by tech transfer offices

112
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,520
is some of the entrepreneurship

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,400
activities proof of concept accelerators

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,960
even venture investment because in

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,680
smaller universities

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,440
they don't have the capacity and they

117
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
don't have the resources and often they

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
don't have the alumni who are giving

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
endowed funds to run some programs that

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
are fundamental al to an innovation

121
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,320
ecosystem. So in other universities it

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,919
falls under tech transfer but here at

123
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,280
MIT as you will all be very familiar

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,199
there are many programs in fact over 85

125
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
that support the entrepreneurship and

126
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,560
innovation going on whether student

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:23,120
stuff or faculty startups access to uh

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,000
NSF I core program Martin trust delta v

129
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
MIT the startup exchange is all part of

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
it and therefore it's not under the

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,680
umbrella of the TLO. However, we are

132
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,919
very close partners. We meet together,

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,080
we talk together, we ensure that we have

134
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
an understanding of what we're all doing

135
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,639
to meet the common goals of getting

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,840
technology knowledge out into the um out

137
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,440
into the world.

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
Okay.

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
So,

140
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,479
um this is some this is some data from

141
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,320
this past year. We run a fiscal year, so

142
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,240
it ends in June. Um the cycle that you

143
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,160
see there invention evaluation

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
protection we will kind of go into in a

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,120
little bit more detail.

146
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,400
We are one of the busiest offices in the

147
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,199
United Sta States if not the busiest

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,400
because of the productiveness and

149
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,319
innovativeness of our faculty and in

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,520
receiving 684 invention disclosures. We

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,080
are only surpassed in universities by

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,880
university systems. University of

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,919
California system, University of Texas

154
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,160
system. But as a single university, we

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,639
hold the highest number of inventions

156
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,639
ever received. And I will talk you

157
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
through the process of what happens to

158
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,639
those inventions. But it is a testament

159
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
to the innovativeness, to the

160
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
engagement, to folks like you who

161
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
participate in the conversations with

162
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
our faculty about the work they're doing

163
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,440
and how it might change the world, how

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,240
it might be translated into products and

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,440
services. We file over last year, we

166
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,240
filed over 600 new patent applications.

167
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,479
We had 282 patents issued. We have a

168
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
portfolio of over 12,000 issued and

169
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,880
pending US and foreign patents that

170
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,039
we're constantly working on refining and

171
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
trying to license. We market

172
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,360
technologies in a variety of ways

173
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,560
including showing it on our website. We

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,199
do transact about 100 plus uh

175
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,400
technologies into licenses and options.

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,080
And last year alone we enabled 38

177
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,479
startup companies to launch with MIT IP.

178
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,000
That even for us was a record. Typically

179
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,080
we're seeing between 20 and 30.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,639
I'll also mention just and call out the

181
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,440
223 billion dollars of research

182
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,039
expenditure happening is both Lincoln

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,560
Lab which is about 1.5 billion of

184
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,880
research funding and 800 million going

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,720
on on the MIT campus. Those are two

186
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,960
distinct entities getting funding from

187
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,879
different sources. And there's a whole

188
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,400
story behind how that IP is managed

189
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
which I'm not going to go into. So

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
you'll just have to ask offline if you

191
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,919
want that story. All right. What else to

192
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,919
tell you? Um okay. So sources of funding

193
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,919
just talk to to you about that for a

194
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,479
minute.

195
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,400
And this is very simplified. So anybody

196
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,520
who knows differently, forgive me for

197
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,479
being going simple. Um

198
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,479
there are typically two buckets of

199
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,759
different sorts of funding that counts

200
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,319
up to that 2.32 billion. um federal

201
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,159
funding which you're probably all very

202
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,760
familiar with given the fact that it's

203
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,360
being talked about a lot and it comes

204
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,959
from the different federal agencies

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,159
whether NSF, Department of War, NASA,

206
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,440
the Army, um uh Health and Human

207
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,160
Services, uh or Department of Energy.

208
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,000
And we also get corporate sponsored

209
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,519
research from partners like you all,

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,360
research collaborations, massive

211
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,000
research agreements, foundations. So

212
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,000
that's kind of how the money comes in

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,959
for each and every one of those

214
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,560
sponsors. A university like MIT has a

215
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
responsibility

216
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
through contracts and federal law by

217
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,160
Dole Act and all sorts of things to

218
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
report to them every single invention

219
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,839
that comes in. So for those 680 blah

220
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,240
whatever I said, we have to tell some

221
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,480
them that we received it. And the reason

222
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,360
for that is there's often contractual

223
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,920
obligations that tie to those inventions

224
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,399
that we have to act on. So, so begins

225
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,040
the invention disclosure process to a

226
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,360
tech transfer office. And that will

227
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,600
happen at any of your institutions

228
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,279
across the world. Something is funded,

229
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
something's created, something's

230
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,360
disclosed. And that is the beginning of

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,560
what we call technology transfer.

232
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,920
All right. I'm going to give you two

233
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,959
scenarios. The perfect world. We get a

234
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,320
disclosure. We do an evaluation. We

235
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,760
protect it with IP patents and the like.

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,240
We market it. We get licenses.

237
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
We develop relationships. And boom, we

238
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,920
get lots of money.

239
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,880
You know what's coming, don't you?

240
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,720
The reality.

241
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,800
It's definitely not as tidy as that. And

242
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,240
in fact, I think I wrote down, "It's

243
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,279
messy and definitely not sequential."

244
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,399
So, a disclosure comes in. It's a Friday

245
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,240
night. The faculty member says to us,

246
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,560
"Did you know I have a conference

247
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,839
tomorrow and I'd like this IP

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,640
protected?" So, we go, "Sure, we'll file

249
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,760
that patent for you right now." And we

250
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,800
do. And then we have to go back after

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,240
the publication or the presentation and

252
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,800
work out what is this invention and how

253
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,640
should we really protect it so that we

254
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,440
can actually get good and robust

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,839
protection in place and from that

256
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,160
protection we might actually discover

257
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
through conversations with the faculty

258
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,040
that they're interested or their

259
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
graduate students are interested in a

260
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,920
startup company. So we don't need to

261
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,560
market it. Whoopdedoo. we have a

262
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,880
conversation but you know what we might

263
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,959
not license it so we do have to market

264
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,360
it and we do that and that is an

265
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,480
iterative process or it could be that

266
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,600
it's a platform technology uh it's one

267
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,160
lency it's non-exclusive licenses we do

268
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,120
one license here we go and market it and

269
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,240
it's it's messy but it's wonderful of

270
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,160
course um and throughout all of this we

271
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,399
have different interactions going on our

272
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,519
licences inform our patent protection

273
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,760
strategy

274
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,279
And throughout it all, we are developing

275
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,399
the relationship because the

276
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,040
relationship is key to a successful

277
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,519
technology transfer.

278
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,240
And then at the end, you see my prior

279
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,600
slide had three dollar signs. This one

280
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,839
has one. That's because sometimes the

281
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,560
revenue expectations

282
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,800
are well, they don't come true for

283
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,120
whatever reason. Whether it's funding,

284
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,040
inability to get to the market, not the

285
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,040
right market, not the right team,

286
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
there's a slew of reasons why things

287
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,399
fail, or they just don't get the

288
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,800
traction that one anticipated.

289
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,399
Okay. So, I am actually going to take

290
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,959
you through this process of what's

291
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,279
important and the sorts of things that

292
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,959
you might

293
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,320
be aware of or not. First and foremost,

294
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:34,000
we are here, and I dare anyone to

295
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,480
dispute me, to help universities get

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,839
technologies into the marketplace for

297
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,639
practical use. We do not produce

298
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,639
products. We do not produce services in

299
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,680
so far as the intellectual property that

300
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,079
we're managing. We are enablers and

301
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,079
facilitators to get other people to

302
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,959
develop the technology. And sometimes

303
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,519
the technology is a glint in the eye of

304
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,920
the faculty member and they don't even

305
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,920
know what the practical application is

306
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,440
going to be but it's really going to be

307
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,839
cool when it becomes something. And so

308
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,720
when we get that invention in we have a

309
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,600
slew of questions to ask about. There is

310
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,160
always an IP policy some whether it's a

311
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,120
company IP policy or a university IP

312
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,600
policy it will outline the ownership. We

313
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,399
have to talk to people about when we own

314
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,560
IP, when we might jointly own IP and

315
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
that is a fundamental tenant of

316
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
education and awareness for our

317
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,720
community. If there are partners, if

318
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
there are other universities, if there

319
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,839
are other research entities working with

320
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,320
us or corporations uh sponsoring

321
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,720
research, there may be jointly owned IP

322
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,200
and the complexity of that relationship

323
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,720
will drive what we consider to be best

324
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,680
for the technology whether it's

325
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,360
licensing to that party or another one.

326
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,240
It's important to always have early

327
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,480
communication to set expectations and

328
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,480
ultimately as I said at the outset this

329
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,639
is about us being enablers and

330
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,000
facilitators to get the technologies

331
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,959
into the marketplace. We are not here to

332
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,160
hold on to that stuff because that's not

333
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,519
our role in the world.

334
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,519
Moving on to evaluation, as I mentioned,

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,120
is there an imminent public uh

336
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,000
disclosure? We have to ensure that our

337
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,760
obligations to our sponsors are met. So,

338
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,399
we need to know who provided the funding

339
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,880
and we can spend a lot of time diving

340
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,959
into was it one agreement, two

341
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,959
agreements, was it a foundation, was it

342
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,639
federal funding, was it sponsorship? And

343
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
as you saw from that graphic at the

344
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,880
beginning, sometimes it's both. We have

345
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,639
to undertake that formal reporting to

346
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,519
the federal government. And I mean

347
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,079
literally this is the technology we got

348
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,079
in and the with the federal government

349
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,639
having opened up their database just

350
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,480
opened up in the last four weeks or

351
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,120
however many weeks it's been since the

352
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,279
government shut down. We've received a

353
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,000
hundred technologies that we now need to

354
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,440
report as of today to tell them we

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,079
received them while the government was

356
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,399
shut down. So this is a constant work

357
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,079
and that's why the office as you saw at

358
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,440
the beginning is structured the way it

359
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,680
is so that somebody can take

360
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
responsibility for that. We have to

361
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,839
discuss with joint owners the management

362
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,360
of the IP and the licensing and

363
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,519
determine a path for commercialization.

364
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,680
As many of you probably know investments

365
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,839
in patents cost money and we don't have

366
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,480
a lot of money. In fact we are you know

367
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,560
an forprofit. We are basically funding

368
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,959
ourselves through the licensing revenue

369
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,519
that we get in in order to be able to

370
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,959
fund new patents that are filed with 600

371
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,560
new inventions, 600 patent filings.

372
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,720
There's a lot of investment that we do

373
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,720
on an annual basis and then we try to

374
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,360
license it so the lences actually

375
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,440
recover those costs. But the ROI for

376
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,320
that actually getting a return on the

377
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,880
investment from the investment is slim,

378
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,120
not none. But we're not going to get all

379
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
of our funding back or our money back

380
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,240
for every technology we might invest in.

381
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,079
So not all inventions are patentable or

382
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,320
should be patented. We do open source,

383
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,480
open access. We bundle knowhow and

384
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,160
technical information. We do copyright

385
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,880
licenses. So why do we file? Well, if a

386
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,600
startup company or an entity is going to

387
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
want to develop the technology and take

388
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
hundreds of millions of dollars to

389
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,000
develop that technology, they want to be

390
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,880
protected from the marketplace. And

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,759
because our technologies are so so

392
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,079
early, then we need to get it protected

393
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,560
as soon as possible so they can begin to

394
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,279
develop their own IP on the back of the

395
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,120
fundamental IP and build portfolios off

396
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,600
that.

397
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,519
And we do and most universities do that

398
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,079
patentability assessment to make that

399
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,240
judgment and to try and ascertain

400
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,600
although we don't have a crystal ball

401
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,839
whether or not there might be

402
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,839
commercialization potential or interest

403
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,120
to marketing.

404
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,759
So there are a variety of different ways

405
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,600
that we market and I when I brought the

406
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,079
when I came here nine years ago there

407
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,839
was no marketing function. The marketing

408
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,000
was considered to be pick up the phone

409
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,240
and that'll be good enough. We're

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,640
actually here not just to market

411
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
technologies. We're here to talk to

412
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
people about what our researchers are

413
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
doing, which is why we publish

414
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,679
technologies on the website in a similar

415
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,079
way to how IOP has on its website many

416
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,080
of the profiles of the faculty. We have

417
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,400
that too. And we also have the

418
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,120
portfolios that they have disclosed to

419
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,360
us. So you could look up any researcher

420
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,559
on our website and find out what they

421
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,440
have uh disclosed and what's uh publish

422
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,360
publicly available. Um we coordinate

423
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,600
with them regarding licensing and

424
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,760
business development and we also have a

425
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,960
presence on LinkedIn social media so

426
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,600
that we are elevating the stories of MIT

427
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,080
with regard to intellectual property and

428
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,160
licensing.

429
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,000
And this is the fun stuff. This is the

430
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,760
stuff that when people say tech transfer

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,360
and commercialization they go yeah

432
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,679
that's licensing and I've just told you

433
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,480
a little bit about the other things but

434
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,200
it's a iterative process and it requires

435
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,760
as I said good communication and really

436
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,720
well aligned goals between the parties

437
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,360
so who do we license to qualified

438
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,280
companies whether startupsmemes

439
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,400
established companies sponsors of

440
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,559
research and the like can we license to

441
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
them is the case is the invention

442
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,760
available

443
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,640
Is it promised to a sponsor? Has it

444
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,400
already been licensed? Uh, is it a joint

445
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
invention? And we have an agreement with

446
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,240
another party that says they're actually

447
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
leading the commercialization and we

448
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,559
have no rights to go and license it to

449
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,280
someone else. And can we actually

450
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,200
license to the company? Is it a country

451
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,520
of concern? Is it a risk elevated uh

452
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,760
company? Is it something that's been

453
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,919
somebody that's been sanctioned? We have

454
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,919
to do all that diligence before we

455
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,600
actually engage in a negotiation with

456
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
any company. What's the

457
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
commercialization plan that we've

458
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,840
thought about and what's the company's

459
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,360
business plan? Do they match? Is there

460
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,200
something different? Did we miss

461
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,360
something? And what does the agreement

462
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,919
look like? Is it an option? Is it a

463
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,799
license? Is it research use only? We

464
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,039
develop a term sheet. We get benchmarks

465
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,400
from the market on the IP in the

466
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,039
industry area and we develop diligence

467
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,760
requirements not out of thin air but

468
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,600
from the milestones and we develop the

469
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,160
diligence and the milestones from the

470
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,919
business plan that the potential LE

471
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
gives to us. So then we're not making

472
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,760
stuff up. You tell us you're going to

473
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,160
develop a market a product in five

474
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,240
years. we're going to say, okay, let's

475
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
put that down and actually let's make it

476
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,400
seven because the likelihood of you

477
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
raising funds in two years is unlikely.

478
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
That will be three. So, we take the

479
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,120
information we're given and we try and

480
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,919
develop it into um a draft agreement and

481
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,760
negotiate the terms. And then comes the

482
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,679
fun stuff and the stuff that people get

483
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,760
really excited about and I'm not going

484
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,840
to give you numbers. I'm sorry.

485
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,880
Components of license agreements are

486
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,280
similar but the economics the diligence

487
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,960
the structure will vary according to the

488
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,240
business and the business model

489
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,720
but the common components issue fees an

490
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,280
annual fee of some sort to keep the uh

491
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,520
IP alive fees if there's

492
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,679
commercialization milestones met

493
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
royalties on products and sales or

494
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
service income if appropriate

495
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,520
reimbursement of the patent costs that

496
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,320
we've incurred that they're going to

497
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,640
take advantage of with regard to the IP

498
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,039
sharing of any sublicicensing

499
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,760
and in the case of startup companies in

500
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,559
order to offset some of those earlier um

501
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,360
fees we don't charge large issue fees to

502
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,640
startups for example we will take a very

503
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,520
small share and I know very small varies

504
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,159
according to country in the US very

505
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,039
small is about 3 to 5% if you go to the

506
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,080
UK it might be 20 to 30 so take your

507
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,320
pick I'd say come to MIT But okay, not

508
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,120
allowed to say that. Um, additional fi

509
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,600
non-financial terms. Is it exclusive or

510
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,559
non-exclusive? Is it a field of use or a

511
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,360
geography? We have to retain rights for

512
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,760
the federal government if it is funded

513
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,080
by the federal government. Which means

514
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
there will be a clause that says the

515
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,200
federal government can use this

516
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,760
technology for free non-exclusively.

517
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,760
No argument. And that will be in every

518
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,760
single license that you see if it's

519
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,440
fedally funded research that created the

520
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,880
IP. If it was sponsored by a if it was

521
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,960
sponsored by a corporation and they have

522
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,039
rights

523
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,039
but they've decided not to take them, we

524
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,360
will mention it was sponsored by them.

525
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,320
Just to be clear, we will reserve our

526
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,440
own rights so that our faculty and

527
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,360
researchers can go on developing the

528
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
research. doesn't mean to say they're

529
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,080
going to do it commercially, but they

530
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,640
have to be able to use it in their lab.

531
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,120
And then we will require performance and

532
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,200
diligence requirements uh to make sure

533
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,200
that the technology is commercialized.

534
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,159
And this is where we differ from

535
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,720
corporations who might patent stuff and

536
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,679
keep it and pick it fence it and do

537
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,840
nothing with it. We have an obligation

538
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,000
based on our mission and goals to get

539
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,760
technology into the marketplace.

540
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Everybody walks into the relationship

541
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,840
with the intention of doing that. But if

542
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,240
stuff happens, we need to be able to get

543
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,880
that technology back to be able to

544
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,280
transfer it to another party to try and

545
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,280
develop it.

546
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,280
And finally, relationship management.

547
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
Successful relationships are developed

548
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,880
based on trust and communication being

549
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,039
open. It begins before the license and

550
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
auction is finalized. So we are

551
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
developing that relationship throughout

552
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,919
and it requires good communication and

553
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,240
align goals as I said previously.

554
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,240
Um it's necessary to ensure the success

555
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,799
of the relationship for all parties. If

556
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,880
we are crosswise with regard to what the

557
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,960
company's doing and what they think our

558
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,200
expectations of them are with regard to

559
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
payment of costs are like we're not

560
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,400
going to get on. So it's really

561
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
important that we pay attention to that.

562
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,520
And it's more than just financial

563
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,240
compliance. I probably I'll say guess

564
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,640
that within about 18 months of us

565
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,919
enacting a startup company license, we

566
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,320
will amend it. Why? Because the business

567
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,919
changes. They need to pivot. Something

568
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
didn't work out they thought the way it

569
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,520
was going to. They didn't get the

570
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,919
funding they thought. And we build in

571
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,520
that flexibility into the way that we

572
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,799
structure our licenses, which is

573
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,280
basically come and talk to us if things

574
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,520
need to change and we can have a

575
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,840
conversation to make sure that you get

576
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,840
as great a chance as possible to be

577
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,840
successful.

578
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:01,600
So you are all probably very familiar

579
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,840
with this valley of death as it's called

580
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,480
and many universities find that their

581
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,520
startups do fail

582
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,080
right about in that dip

583
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,720
because they cannot get the funding the

584
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,880
technology is not validated

585
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,760
um they just have not got the right

586
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,760
market fit and the like.

587
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
But

588
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,240
it does emphasize the need for a very

589
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,960
strong business plan and the ability to

590
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,080
pivot as I just mentioned. But also the

591
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,799
recognition that sometimes it's better

592
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,440
just to call it. If it's not working,

593
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,960
you might just need to say this is not

594
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,960
working. We can't get the funding and

595
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,279
we're going to have to fold. And that

596
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,240
does happen and it has happened to many

597
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,000
university tech startup companies and as

598
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,200
you know from the marketplace at the

599
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,960
moment in particular areas biotech in

600
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,440
particular you're seeing lots of layoffs

601
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,520
and and uh businesses shutting down

602
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,440
because the funding environment sucks or

603
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,679
because the regulatory programs have

604
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,360
changed or whatever it might be.

605
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:13,120
So

606
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:15,440
these are not entirely MIT IP developed

607
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,360
companies. Some of them are, but these

608
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,400
are some examples of products and

609
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,480
companies made possible through um

610
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,600
university tech transfer. So the most

611
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,320
obvious one and the one that um P

612
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,600
University of Pennsylvania made a lot of

613
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,039
money off as a co 19 vaccine. Um there

614
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,880
are other drugs on the market that

615
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,520
you'll be very familiar with that came

616
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,480
out of university labs whether it's

617
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,840
couadin remade casi

618
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,520
um uh gardicil lica

619
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,840
uh even the just the the basic um oh

620
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,120
what's it called the um warerin blood

621
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,840
thinner came out of warf um nicotine

622
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:01,440
patches um some very fundamental um

623
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,960
digital technologies and optics DVDs,

624
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,679
Vixels, lasers, LEDs, Blu-ray disc, DVD.

625
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,360
I could go on and on and on. A lot of

626
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,720
very um uh fundamental battery

627
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,720
technology came out of universities.

628
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,039
And for the land grants, some apple

629
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
varieties, grape varieties, corn

630
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,600
varieties, ways in which they can

631
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,600
increase the the um the crop yields

632
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,600
comes from some of the great a schools.

633
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
In addition to creating companies and

634
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,919
creating products, there are other ways

635
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,840
that you small companies can have

636
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,880
impact. And these are five examples of

637
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,440
uh over the last 15 years.

638
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,640
MIT startup companies that were bought

639
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,440
by large companies or acquired or or

640
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,520
merged with. Samsung uh took on QD

641
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,360
vision. Johnson and Johnson acquired

642
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,720
Terrace Biomed. Merc over 15 years ago

643
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,240
bought Smart Sales just a few uh weeks

644
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,520
ago. Atlantic Quant um Google Quantum uh

645
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,080
bought at Atlantic Quantum and Red Hat

646
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,880
acquired Neural Magic uh sometime

647
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,880
earlier this year.

648
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,919
So I mentioned briefly

649
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,760
um some of the reasons why people fall

650
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,960
into that pit um that valley of death

651
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,080
and CB Insights did this study um in

652
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,760
2021. It was a fairly small sample but

653
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm pretty sure these are fairly

654
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,279
accurate. It's 111 startup companies.

655
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,000
Some ran out of cash or these are ranked

656
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,880
in the highest no market need. Some got

657
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,919
out competed, flawed business model,

658
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,919
regulatory challenges, pricing cost

659
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,080
issues, not the right team. There are a

660
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,640
myriad of reasons. This is a risky

661
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,799
business, but we're in it in order to

662
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,760
try and have impact. And so we try and

663
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,919
stay the course and that's why being

664
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,640
able to get technology back for a

665
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,640
university is so important that we can

666
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,360
actually try again with another partner.

667
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,360
So the takeaways for you, tech transfer

668
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,279
is a partnership.

669
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,440
Not every tech transfer results in

670
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,399
successful products or services. There

671
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,840
are many many stakeholders and from idea

672
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,604
to impact takes time and investment. And

673
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,624
that's all I have for you. Thank you.

674
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:29,624
[applause]

675
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:43,279
>> Two questions. Who are the lucky two?

676
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,960
How do you know if the lency is

677
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,159
reporting all of their revenues that

678
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,320
include your licensed inventions? What a

679
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,960
great question.

680
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,480
You want to come work for me?

681
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,520
Um

682
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,120
we have a team we Google alert is a

683
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,520
wonderful thing that we track um and we

684
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,279
use another database called cap IQ that

685
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,240
tracks what's going on in companies that

686
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,640
have licensed IP and to the point that

687
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,799
we can track we can keep eyes on what

688
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,640
they are saying and many of them talk

689
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,760
about their successes um we can get a

690
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,799
sense but we also when they begin to if

691
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,399
they report and you know we you with the

692
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,799
best will in the world. We track as much

693
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,960
as we can, but when they report, we

694
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,120
actually do check that against any

695
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,399
public announcements and if we have any

696
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,279
doubts, we have the right to audit and

697
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,080
so we can go in at any time to audit an

698
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,600
entity. Obviously with many companies

699
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,840
what we do is we kind of give them a

700
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,440
runway and then we begin to see I mean

701
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
some people just don't seem to be able

702
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,080
to work out Excel spreadsheets when they

703
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,240
do their calculations and it's a quick

704
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,240
fix and others are kind of like yeah

705
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
this doesn't seem to make sense and

706
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,000
others get really technical because

707
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,480
you're actually having to talk to them

708
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,039
about which l because if we've got

709
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,120
multiple patents in a in a company

710
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,000
that's selling multiple products we have

711
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,919
to map the patents to the products to be

712
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,760
able to assess if they're different

713
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,919
products, how much licensing revenue

714
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,320
they actually owe us. So, it is a

715
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,240
complicated process, which is why all of

716
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,840
those teams that tech transfer offices

717
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
have are really important to being able

718
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,960
to do that and check that people are

719
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,960
paying us what they're due.

720
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,960
How often does MIT grant exclusive

721
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,799
versus non-exclusive licenses and what

722
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,919
is the high level criteria for such

723
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,640
decisions? Um the high level criteria is

724
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,520
it depends on the technology.

725
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,000
If it is a semiconductor technology that

726
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,600
has ubiquitous use to go in every single

727
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,600
phone device, we're not going to give it

728
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,840
to one company, going to give it to

729
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,720
multiple companies. If it is a

730
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,200
technology that really is so unique that

731
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,840
is going to need a very focused

732
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,399
development program, we may do an

733
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,880
exclusive, but we may because there

734
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,600
could even be multiple application areas

735
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,919
within that thing, but it needs a lot of

736
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,799
work first. We might do mandatory

737
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,200
sublicicensing or we might provide

738
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,840
milestones by which they have to ensure

739
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,760
that they hit if there's five fields

740
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,840
those five fields within x number of

741
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,279
years and if they can't or if we get

742
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,000
someone who's interested in those

743
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,080
different fields we will actually ask

744
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,760
them to give us that field back and we

745
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,520
will license it or they have to

746
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,520
mandatorily license it separately

747
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,960
and I think that's all you got and I'm

748
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,960
getting kicked off the stage. Thank you.
