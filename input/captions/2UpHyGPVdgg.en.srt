1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,240
so we're going to make a good part of

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,600
today about talking about some of the

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,640
other people who have thought about

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,080
music representation or or talking about

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,000
other people's thoughts and whether we

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,480
agree with them or not specifically to

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,720
Giants of the field uh elanar suffrage

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,439
field um her article on um music

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,520
representation and uh Nicholas cook on

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,399
what's comparative musicology and what's

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,680
computational musicology and what they

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,879
might have to do with each other if

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,920
anything so let's um let's start by by

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,079
talking uh a little bit about the Elanor

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,000
self field article um she's a before

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,719
getting into computers and continuing

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
afterwards she's a specialist in broke

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,039
music which is sort of uh Western

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:04,519
European musical era from a lot of

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:07,240
people say 1600 to 17750 roughly 1580 to

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,520
1770 but with the previous areas

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,360
overlapping and previous and next ones

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,360
for a bit

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,759
um and so she talks about uh about some

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:25,640
some things in her article um anyone

26
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:29,079
remember anything about um the article

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,960
that has this diagram what's what's she

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,159
kind of showing

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,159
here we

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,079
call I know you do you're just

31
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:49,280
shy a note has a lot of parameters note

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,640
has a lot of parameters yes no has a lot

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,520
of parameters what kind of relationship

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,000
are we talking about has a

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,520
means what word pops into your head when

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,520
you think of Haas

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,879
so into your ontologies that forgotten

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,560
what are the two

39
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,400
choices yeah go ahead morom tonomy and

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,000
morony Hann did you have your hand for

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,760
which one of those two that would be is

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,800
it morom moromi yes yes yes because the

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,080
taxonomy is the one that we use for uh

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,879
Kingdom film you know what what kind of

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,400
thing is something yeah so note has a

46
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,040
lot of um different

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,440
different parameters and it's made up of

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,519
a lot of different parameters I think

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,400
it's it's something that maybe just

50
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,599
sounds so obvious but but this was you

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,599
know a really revolutionary way of

52
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,360
thinking about some of these things and

53
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,319
this diagram has become sort of the one

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
of the legendary diagrams in the field

55
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,480
every field has these legendary diagrams

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,840
and I know um that Dr suff field would

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,319
have drawn that flat a little bit better

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,760
uh if she had known that this was going

59
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,440
to become so famous but yeah this is

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,280
this is the one that we oh yeah we're

61
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,959
talking about components of a note and

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,760
we're going to argue about certain

63
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,159
things um and we can see that some of

64
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
these things are

65
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,920
um what kind of a thing is duration she

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,959
talks about is it a graphical thing can

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,959
you see

68
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,239
duration it's interesting that's that's

69
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,239
good that's good that you're you're

70
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,840
puzzling over it

71
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,640
there's well let's um let's try to

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,040
figure out the context that I'm talking

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,760
about when we talk about duration she

74
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,360
talks about three contexts that musical

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,879
representation happens in if you

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,879
remember them three

77
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:56,720
contexts it's a big part

78
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,720
of one of the early parts of our

79
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,400
article give the first letter

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,400
of each of

81
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,959
them that trigger anything what what is

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,519
some ways music's represented

83
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,440
yeah the graphical yep the graphical how

84
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,440
it looks

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,120
right great let's let's fill out the

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
other two before getting back to the

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,280
question I was talking about yeah go

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,560
ahead what's that the sound

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,919
sound good and then the other one she

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,560
uses kind of um

91
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:47,039
two words at different

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:51,199
points or the graph the sound

93
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:55,199
graphical uh is that semantical semantic

94
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:59,160
yep and semantic or semantical I like

95
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:03,199
semantical um and um what would the L be

96
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,840
it's a in this case for her logical

97
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,120
logical yeah so the semantic yeah you're

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,560
right it should be sort of alls

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:17,000
logical great so what's duration in this

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,520
which context are we talking about

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,520
we in this

102
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:32,080
diagram what's that I just can't hear

103
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,560
Graal graphic and or logical graphical

104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,919
or logical great so definitely not sound

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,520
right are we all in agreement with Jake

106
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,319
that uh that that that this doesn't

107
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,479
sound very good unless you have a good

108
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,639
internal imagination right this is we're

109
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,319
not hearing anything good

110
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,440
so what's and who you got to take a

111
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,160
stand on this if even if you're wrong

112
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,960
who who wants to say that that this

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,319
duration here is more in the graphical

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,039
domain I mean we're seeing a picture

115
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,199
here good and who thinks is more in The

116
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,720
Logical domain great great super so we

117
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,960
have have a little bit of disagreement

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,039
more people on the graphical side what

119
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,520
what would be the argument that um that

120
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,120
it's a graphical duration somebody who

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,319
who went for the graphical yeah Vanessa

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,280
it's a visual representation there are a

123
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,880
bunch of different visual

124
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,759
representations that represent how long

125
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,440
a note is supposed to be so you can like

126
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,400
look at it and'll make sense what it's

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,840
supposed to be great super so we can

128
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,319
look at it and we can see what's going

129
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,919
to be we a graphic and we see the

130
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,319
graphic and go there who wants to make

131
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,319
an argument for The Logical on

132
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,680
this three people yeah um I guess like

133
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,599
even just seeing this it's all relative

134
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,120
to other parts of the like you need the

135
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:51,000
conly the sycal context of like beats

136
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,160
per minute or like yeah um and the times

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,039
are sharing right so so we're we're

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,840
going quite a bit further and saying

139
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,280
yeah the duration only makes sense in a

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:05,080
larger context of things super um let me

141
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,039
come up with two ways that you might uh

142
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,039
describe something we'll stop

143
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,199
there describe what I did what I have on

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,199
the board in the most purely graphical

145
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,199
description possible

146
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,599
take yeah

147
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,599
John three notes ofal with have three

148
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,599
notes of equal duration

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:54,879
great dur um dur yeah not

150
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,280
dur anyone want to see if we can go even

151
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,599
more graphically yes go ahead Jason uh

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,639
two vertical lines with three three

153
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,840
filled in circles with sticks attached

154
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,159
two vertical lines with three filled in

155
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,080
circles with sticks attached I like

156
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,960
everything about that except the word

157
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,240
that came before attached why don't I

158
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,240
like

159
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,240
sticks I like stems even

160
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,080
less lines yeah what what don't I like

161
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,800
about stems if we're going for

162
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,039
sticks yeah Adam they already give a

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,080
contextualization for an abstract symbol

164
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,640
yes we're already abstracting something

165
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
Jason that was

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,080
fantastic and and and Adam great to the

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,080
yeah so so we can go we're already

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,920
making assumptions that well you know a

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,560
line could represent a stick so um it

170
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,720
was uh John's thing that two notes of

171
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:56,600
equal durations is a great description

172
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,399
but which one um but three filled in

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,600
circles and by the way we're already um

174
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,519
we're already doing some sort of uh

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,920
we're already interpreting a little bit

176
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:13,160
that u a bunch of continuous lines that

177
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,720
um are kind of oline and stick out we

178
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,959
think oh that kind of represents a

179
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,200
circle but yeah but we'll go with that

180
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,200
three build in circles

181
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,480
between two

182
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,000
lines with more lines okay something

183
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,959
like like that

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,240
which one of these does suffrage field

185
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,480
consider to be on the graphical domain

186
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,480
and which one to be on The

187
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,600
Logical too

188
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:52,600
obvious shout it out which graphical or

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
logical

190
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,240
logical Des describe the thing that it's

191
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,839
pointing to you in the most graphical

192
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,839
form you

193
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,480
can so you want to take a shot at this

194
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,440
Matthew do you want to take a shot what

195
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,839
it's pointing to in the most

196
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,760
graphical it's a flag hanging off the

197
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,040
end of the stem it's a flag hanging off

198
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,920
the end of the stem who who wants to uh

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:31,200
go even even further back this corner

200
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
take a shot

201
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:39,480
I mean a strip that like decreases in

202
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,320
width in a curled a strip that decreases

203
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,720
in width in a curled uh manner yeah so I

204
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,000
think we can go further even than a flag

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,680
but we can but we sort of have curled

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,959
strip thing your interpretation says oh

207
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,880
that's a flag and then there sort of a

208
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,240
Next Level Up says Flags represent

209
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,440
duration so we can go in all these world

210
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,399
and what um why I love this article even

211
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,480
though it's you know now over 20 years

212
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:14,440
old is that nobody puts out so clearly

213
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,040
to me to um to think about what all

214
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,360
these things actually mean so we have

215
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,560
three domains that she's talking about

216
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,600
the sound a context she says ter she

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,880
uses uh I call them domains in my head

218
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,920
we'll use her term uh context sound

219
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:34,519
graphical or she most uses the word

220
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,160
logical um but um

221
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,360
semantic or semantical could also be uh

222
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,720
is also a you term that's use and that

223
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:48,880
one is coming up a lot

224
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,399
more together these last two parts and

225
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,120
and we're pretty good at distinguishing

226
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,680
between sound and either of these other

227
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,680
ones right yeah

228
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,240
um together these last two will

229
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,240
sometimes put them together as

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,839
symbolic that these are things that deal

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,680
with symbols on a page or conceptually

232
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,760
on a page or conceptually written

233
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:18,720
written or conceptually written um great

234
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:22,720
now uh she says in her article which one

235
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
of these holds the most

236
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,079
interest BL

237
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,720
remember this it's okay it's a longish

238
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,760
article but yeah it's a graphical

239
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,199
graphical unfortunately not but thanks

240
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,040
thanks for taking a bold stand stuff's

241
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:50,320
good we've eliminated graphical which

242
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,320
one want I take a

243
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,800
guess um I'm I'm gonna say sound you

244
00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:02,240
would say sound and you would

245
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,800
be with most human beings because most

246
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,920
people buy uh many more CDs than they

247
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,279
buy abstract musical scores encoded in

248
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:16,680
computers but she's really on The

249
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,839
Logical so it's good um so sound yeah

250
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,480
sound is is what most of us work with

251
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,839
the music but for for her purposes for

252
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,079
the purposes of representation she

253
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,279
especially she was really interested in

254
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,360
logical things thanks uh right everybody

255
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,320
who didn't speak was thinking of logical

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,120
and and think no thank you um bold

257
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,399
people for for taking a stab at this

258
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
um great

259
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,199
so one of the things that she talks

260
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
about um later on do you remember that

261
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,360
she talks about musical scores and

262
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,880
anyone remember any sorts of musical

263
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,000
scores she brings

264
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,399
in some funny ones and some pretty

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,399
normal

266
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,920
ones we had a lot more fun on our on our

267
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:09,000
problem set this weekend than read time

268
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,000
I can tell went in but not in the depth

269
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,680
that second Trio from the Mozart Claret

270
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,160
quintet was the first one she also thank

271
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,480
you thank you Jake I was uh you know

272
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
you're allowed to have computers open so

273
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,399
you can also uh look at these if you

274
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,160
want yeah uh she also talks oops sorry

275
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,399
thank you somebody I'm going to going to

276
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,440
assign tasks for each person to fix VAR

277
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
stupid CU prisms so I'm going to want

278
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,600
one person to be the um we can't see

279
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,000
anything task and one person for the um

280
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,279
the the thing is rolled up okay yeah so

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,880
this particular one she also does some

282
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,480
other things including Gregorian chant

283
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,959
um a lot of things representing sort of

284
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,240
a music historical perspective um and

285
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,720
each one chosen uh many of the later

286
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,639
ones chosen because they have a

287
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,880
particular interest and difficulty in

288
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:10,320
representing part of your problem set

289
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,360
too is to make a contribution to that

290
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,800
set of

291
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,440
Repertory that um when you say and you

292
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,199
will hear software people and coming up

293
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,759
with things who haven't been taking you

294
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,639
the full liberal arts education and

295
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,079
music you know oh I have a system that

296
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,279
can represent all music I want to be

297
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,240
like great here's DDR show me how your

298
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:34,360
system represents here's here's um South

299
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,079
Indian music how does it so these are

300
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,720
are all challenges and there'll never be

301
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,199
a system that can represent all of them

302
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,360
but

303
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,399
um hence why most of us will avoid the

304
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,199
all music

305
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,680
things this particular score has had a

306
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:56,680
um about as much impact from the article

307
00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:00,000
as this diagram had um it's sort of

308
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,519
become the Hol world a little bit more

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,399
complex than Holo world of Music in

310
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:09,319
representation encoding I want know

311
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,839
computers explain what a h world

312
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,839
is yeah the basic file that everyone

313
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,680
writes at the beginning as a sample yep

314
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,160
and what do you do with hello world you

315
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
you print it out print it out somewhere

316
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,319
great and um some languages you put that

317
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,440
back slash n otherwise nothing prints

318
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,160
yep great so it's how do you get how do

319
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
you do something very simple in a

320
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,560
programming language this piece piece or

321
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,959
at least the clarinet part the top part

322
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,800
of the five has become that um that

323
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,319
piece so um at least one of it so I

324
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,279
think we should at least hear it once so

325
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:46,880
we can get it in our head oh and uh just

326
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,680
just so you just so I can kind of hear

327
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,600
kind of go when um you might do it

328
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,480
involuntarily when something happens

329
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,850
that's not in the score from this

330
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:06,970
recording

331
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:06,970
[Music]

332
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,959
I didn't

333
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,959
hear

334
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,320
repeat now Adam on it anybody

335
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,320
else yeah what

336
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,080
was uh they kind of glazed over the

337
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,360
triplet at glazed over the triplet yeah

338
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,480
great which is uh which is kind of a

339
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,919
problematic per uh performance for this

340
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,440
particular one because one of the

341
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,360
reasons why this is almost certainly

342
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,360
chosen was can your system represent

343
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,400
triplets um the performers playing on a

344
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,720
clarinet that uh we hypothesized mozar

345
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,440
originally wrote this for that could go

346
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,039
two notes lower than this and so played

347
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,200
those low notes instead of um instead of

348
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,640
starting high and going down good so

349
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,400
this is um the hello world piece that

350
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,799
you'll be getting uh any other thoughts

351
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,000
about uh Elena suffrage Fields work will

352
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,280
come back to her more as the semester

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,280
comes

354
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,200
on well um just a just a reminder uh

355
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,120
there's one um exam in this class and

356
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,320
it's um sort of the midterm but it's

357
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,360
about two-thirds of the way through the

358
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,120
semester and it's the one uh the only

359
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,760
one that's not based at all on

360
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,559
programming but based on readings and um

361
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
and the big thoughts I put it that way

362
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,520
so that you have these readings and big

363
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,000
thoughts going through your head as you

364
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,840
start working on your final projects um

365
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,600
I think this is I think you can pretty

366
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,159
much count um that some thoughts this

367
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,520
and some of these questions might be on

368
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:59,280
there so give it another read when you

369
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:03,880
get a chance and let's move on to

370
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,600
um Nicholas Cook's uh comparative versus

371
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,280
computational musicology article and

372
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,000
here I've given you the questions I'm

373
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,960
going to be asking uh written down on

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,720
the outline today um and I and so take a

375
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,280
second to um you jot down some some of

376
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,600
the notes so you probably already have

377
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:25,039
them because I gave you these also on

378
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:28,120
the um on the canvas s right

379
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,240
thinking about um take a second while I

380
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,440
play uh a little example from the first

381
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,440
piece that

382
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,430
um that he discusses

383
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,430
[Music]

384
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:55,720
[Music]

385
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,689
[Music]

386
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,290
[Music]

387
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,559
would know 2001 Space Odyssey this one

388
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,559
of the

389
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,000
pieces okay so

390
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,679
um we'll get back to this and you what

391
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,440
he uses this piece for in a little bit

392
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,559
but first thing is kind of the

393
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,559
fundamental question one of the a couple

394
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,679
of the fundamental questions about CL

395
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,960
what um what does he mean there's no

396
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,760
such thing as a good or bad

397
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,440
representation of Music per se yeah

398
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,919
Vanessa like just of the point is that

399
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,760
like it's all that's particularly good

400
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,640
or bad about it it's like depending on

401
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
what you're attempting to use it for

402
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,080
there are different situations where

403
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
like certain characteristics might be

404
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,080
more beneficial than others and in that

405
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,720
scenario you can make a good or a bad

406
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
choice but it doesn't mean it's all

407
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,360
around great so so fantastic I think

408
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,559
that really captures a lot of what cook

409
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,440
saying it all depends on what you're

410
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,320
trying to get out of it what are you

411
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,320
trying to do so U some of your own

412
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,799
representations um are going to be

413
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,720
really bad representations even if you

414
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,840
get an A+ for certain things

415
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,440
but um o did I like have the whole

416
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,200
recording going um but they could be

417
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,440
great representations for some other

418
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,919
things um somebody want to give an

419
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,520
example either from the reading or um or

420
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,799
from your own thoughts but maybe

421
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,679
preferably from the reading if you have

422
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:52,600
it of of what one representation that

423
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,120
would be uh bad in a specific case and a

424
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,919
rep and the same representation how it

425
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,320
could be really good for something

426
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,080
else yeah go ahead

427
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,840
um I guess the is more detailed but like

428
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,120
at the beginning they had a lot of um

429
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,279
charts that represented pieces and they

430
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,039
mentioned that this would be really good

431
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:10,000
for like comparing the formats of

432
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,159
different pieces to each other or like

433
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,480
finding similarities between repertoire

434
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
but for example like a performer

435
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,840
wouldn't be able to use this

436
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,840
representation fantastic so cook begins

437
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,080
uh his article by showing certain charts

438
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,840
that might uh help compare similarities

439
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,080
across pieces but not not be very good

440
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,840
for a performer so this is

441
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,840
um from the same piece from Luke's

442
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,240
etterna one of the parts showing at any

443
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:43,159
given moment what the full range of the

444
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:47,039
piece is um what's the um what can you

445
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:51,320
say about what happens to the range of

446
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,320
the piece around measure 60

447
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,640
65 I want to take it

448
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,200
yeah go

449
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,520
ahead like the average pitch just

450
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,720
increases overall the average pitch what

451
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,039
frequency frequency the average

452
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,039
frequency increases quite a bit there

453
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,000
right anything else you could say about

454
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,760
it it's going more specific even that

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,880
that the average pitch because that

456
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,159
that's also a very good representation

457
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,720
average pitch yeah Adam there's a

458
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,240
descending sequence that goes throughout

459
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,600
the can there's there's a yeah there's a

460
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,640
descending uh line sequence something

461
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,440
like that that's continuing on and then

462
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,440
it continues but what else

463
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,120
happens yeah Jason a bunch of voices

464
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,720
appear in the top great yeah a bunch of

465
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,039
voices comeing in the

466
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,120
top and the top most ones maybe also

467
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,600
have a descending sequence that's it's

468
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,360
great now I mean you can get all of this

469
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,520
from a musical score but we'll go back

470
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,679
here where's the first um first point

471
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,840
that there's two different

472
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,840
notes this measure here

473
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,880
here you could do it you can do it but

474
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,080
that is what this is not a very good

475
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,159
representation of on the other hand it's

476
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,279
a very good representation for seeing Oh

477
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,520
my gosh I'm going to have to count

478
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:27,080
really hard if I want to get in exactly

479
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,559
at that right moment right but um second

480
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,279
representation showing the number of

481
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,600
different notes pitch count graph how

482
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,600
many different notes are being sung is a

483
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,520
very good representation if you just

484
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,200
wanted to um now now you're doing your

485
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,640
uh next horror film or something and

486
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,399
you're a big Stanley Kubrick fan so

487
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,120
you're going to rip off uh what he did

488
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:50,600
in 2001 uh but you just need a 5-second

489
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,960
clip for your scariest part where are

490
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,960
you going to choose give me a measure

491
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,840
number that give me a shot 52 53 52 53

492
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,799
yeah right we have a whole bunch of

493
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,039
different pitches all sounding at the

494
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,320
same time that could be really tense I

495
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,480
think this is talking about um pitches

496
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,120
without octave pitch classes you all

497
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,640
know that term now um so yeah a lot of

498
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,320
things happening very easy to do in this

499
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,559
graph but very hard to do in

500
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,120
others so

501
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,640
um goes through some of the different

502
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,880
things now

503
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,159
oh this gra sorry I just forgot on this

504
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,559
this one per can you perform from this

505
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,840
one from this

506
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:45,440
graph see a lot of I see some up I I see

507
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,279
I see some yeah it's not the

508
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,399
best thing for being able to perform

509
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,880
that piece probably not the best thing

510
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:56,760
but you can almost perform from it from

511
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,080
the range graph thing so there's some

512
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,480
things that are in between um better the

513
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,840
pitch count graph can you perform from

514
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,559
this no though you could I mean thinking

515
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,480
about in the future you could take a

516
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,480
piece's pitch count graph and uh use a

517
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,039
computer to write a different piece that

518
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,000
had the same pitch count profile um and

519
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,120
it might be an interesting type of thing

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,880
um but yeah you couldn't perform this

521
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,559
the same piece for some ontological

522
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,559
definition of the same piece right good

523
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,679
we can skip the entrance graph uh second

524
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:36,399
piece talks about um oh this is the B

525
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,559
talk string quartet number four oops

526
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:41,440
we'll get a tiny if it's working a few

527
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:43,480
seconds that if it doesn't give me a

528
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,919
YouTube

529
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:50,960
ad no okay

530
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,559
um B talk similar uh similar era a

531
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,240
little bit earlier uh composer also

532
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,559
Hungarian um so this is

533
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,679
showing what is this showing I remember

534
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:07,440
somebody who I haven't heard from

535
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,440
yet Jonathan do you remember

536
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:13,720
this soundes sound waves what particular

537
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,640
parts of it

538
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,159
anybody

539
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,120
that not sure you're not sure okay good

540
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,399
good not not sure saves the whole class

541
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:30,080
great super harmonics harmonics no not

542
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:32,520
exactly this yeah def amplitude how loud

543
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,120
each part is what does it mean when the

544
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,679
V is really really really really

545
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,679
quiet it's not playing yep so you can

546
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,159
quickly see which parts are playing

547
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,919
where and then somehow make a composite

548
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,600
that is more like the um the uh what do

549
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,480
you call it the amplitude wave type the

550
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:56,080
um the sound wave um of of the piece as

551
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,760
a whole so yeah um I don't this is this

552
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,519
is one of the ones in that article that

553
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,360
one of the most so I'm always like eh

554
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,000
doesn't get so much out of it but um but

555
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,480
because this is the type of thing

556
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,840
computational people do wrote my own

557
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,840
program to generate the same thing um

558
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:18,279
this is a piece by hien's uh uh by uh

559
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,320
yoseph Heiden uh around I guess 1790 uh

560
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:23,200
called the surprise symy uh anyone know

561
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,000
where the surprise happens from looking

562
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,600
at this yeah so sometimes these things

563
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,559
can be uh very great I didn't even

564
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,159
realize though that the Dynamics were

565
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,679
kind of thinning out leading up to it I

566
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,279
always knew that there was one gigantic

567
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,679
cord right about here um go on and you

568
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,200
can see the various other places that

569
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,799
these things happen so so these can be

570
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,559
good representations for some

571
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,720
things so what's this hum drum that he's

572
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:57,919
talking about anybody

573
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,919
remember this part yeah

574
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:07,080
a to manipulate

575
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:09,600
dat great so it's a I think I heard it's

576
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,640
a framework that's used to manipulate

577
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,279
musical data uh in the Unix uh terminal

578
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,720
great um it's written by um it was

579
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:22,080
originally uh written by um music cogn

580
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,039
cognition perception and Theory

581
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,120
specialist uh David hiron and um who

582
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,399
we're going to read a lot about what he

583
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,960
used hum drum to kind of demonstrate new

584
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,120
about music but right now we're mostly

585
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,600
you know we're looking at oh what he did

586
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,679
um humdrum is uh in many ways the pred

587
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,159
the predecessor to music 21 and a

588
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,840
lecture that David hon the inventor gave

589
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,679
when I was uh I think I was a first year

590
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,919
grad student to like change my life I'm

591
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,279
like oh my gosh I want to do this but uh

592
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:59,799
your system the system was already 10 15

593
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:01,760
years old by then 20 years old maybe and

594
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,399
um like we have these things called

595
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,600
objects now so but um so it's a non-ob

596
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,559
oriented it's shell shell scripting

597
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,399
things which is pretty cool if anybody

598
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,039
anyone ever pipe a script from one thing

599
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,279
to the next you yeah youve input send it

600
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:20,080
to a program uh input text usually or or

601
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:21,720
bytes and then it sends something out

602
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,039
and you can send it to the next program

603
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,480
so you could have one program that just

604
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,720
goes through and strips all the ties

605
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,120
from notes and then you have another

606
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,480
program that you know labels the pitch

607
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:37,559
classes of everything um very very cool

608
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,720
very um new things and so hum drum had

609
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,000
its own format which was called um

610
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,720
actually I'm going to jump through some

611
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,919
some of these questions don't don't seem

612
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,760
as relevant for class discussion called

613
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:54,120
Kern which was basically a musical score

614
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,080
turned sideways so first part going

615
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,559
vertically here second part vertically

616
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,639
here third part and so on

617
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:05,360
um and um and so this was a way that

618
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:06,919
meant that looking horizontally you

619
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,039
could see anything that was happening at

620
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,440
the same time and very useful back

621
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:14,840
before graphical editors where you can

622
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:20,080
uh tab among

623
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:25,039
them oops contrasting um uh in the

624
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:28,039
article was this particular um

625
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,440
format ESS code and this is um one of

626
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:33,960
ones how do we read

627
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,360
this some people Adam great but I want

628
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,919
to want to get some more reluctant

629
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,240
participants and we'll come

630
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,159
back anyone want to take a guess what

631
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,039
anything means um yeah John like some

632
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,799
sort of figured base some sort of

633
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,360
figured base yeah does totally look like

634
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,679
that not exactly what what it actually

635
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,000
is but great great first first guess

636
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,240
what what numbers do you see that um

637
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,399
that that make you think it's like

638
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,440
figured base so scale degrees scale

639
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:04,600
degrees Yeah so something maybe to do

640
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,320
with scale degrees do we see eights and

641
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,919
nines are zeros no no so so that can be

642
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,639
a good good thing what so great great

643
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,840
guess that moved us into toward the

644
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,880
right direction um these are scale

645
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,080
degrees what's all this other stuff

646
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,159
might

647
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,399
be yeah Hannah is like the sharps and

648
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,039
the dashes represent like The Accidental

649
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:31,519
so Sharps probably a good one do um with

650
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,080
this part so this piece would have a lot

651
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,320
of accidentals if the underscore did and

652
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,960
might like the shorter Dash oh the

653
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,679
shorter Dash can you tell me where one

654
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,639
is uh I guess like in the first line the

655
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,360
one before the seven yeah I should be

656
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:48,519
like can somebody point out one that I

657
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,679
can reach yeah this one or this one good

658
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,760
good yeah so um minus signs you've I

659
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,600
think we've already seen that as a way

660
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,159
of representing um maybe Flats flats and

661
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,880
Shar shs I mean when we say there is no

662
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,200
such thing as a good representation or

663
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,000
bad representation per se I will say it

664
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,840
is a bad representation If this means

665
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,399
flat and that means sharp but if we

666
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,399
reverse them so I'll assume that good uh

667
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:18,480
What are some of the other symbols we

668
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,799
see yeah Adam then symbols in the melody

669
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,320
or any what's some other things you see

670
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,159
up here top is the composer top is the

671
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,919
composer maybe

672
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,279
boam it's not actually but but good

673
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:38,679
guess good guess that's great

674
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:39,760
um yeah Vincent sorry sorry V and then I

675
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:41,720
I don't think he's going to fire

676
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,399
everything yep the underscores represent

677
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,279
duration and then like the 16y

678
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:48,799
represents like the lowest okay okay

679
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,320
good good good so we'll start we'll

680
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,840
start with one thing the underscores

681
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,240
might represent duration so what does

682
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,000
that what's that mean think think about

683
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,840
that for a second we'll come back that's

684
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,039
totally what I say okay well then fill

685
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,120
it out a little bit um well I was going

686
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,080
to guess that like one underscore would

687
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,359
be some standard like maybe a coordinate

688
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,320
or something like that and then two is

689
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,760
more yep and then two is more how it's

690
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,960
it's a fixed width font but it's

691
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,639
stilling hard to see do we what are the

692
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,240
lengths that we see the

693
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,119
most

694
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:29,440
one two do we see three a

695
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,520
lot not too many no end of the line end

696
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,159
of the line line yeah so there's some

697
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,639
places where you see through good good

698
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,119
so that might have something to do with

699
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,560
things

700
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,480
um any places where there's two that are

701
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,839
uh numbers that

702
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,839
are without uh separating

703
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,000
underscore John where do you see one

704
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,480
bottom left bottom left good thanks for

705
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,200
finding one I can point to you yep so

706
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,160
and what's right proceeding it

707
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,760
period period what period might

708
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,720
represent rest might represent a rest

709
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,680
what else might it represent

710
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,680
yeah good a DOT a DOT so it could be one

711
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,240
of those

712
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,720
things quite often after let's see so

713
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,680
one of the ways we can figure out is if

714
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,320
we get a particular length and then does

715
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,880
everything else work what do you think

716
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,880
the space

717
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,440
means measure separation measure

718
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:33,880
separation some measures seem to be a

719
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,119
lot shorter than others but yeah it

720
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,160
could be a measure separation could also

721
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,520
be as a lot of these formats are just to

722
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,240
make it easier for us to read that

723
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,680
there's a certain readability that's

724
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,560
built into some good good um and uh

725
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,079
Vincent you were starting to say

726
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,319
something about the 16 up there having

727
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,400
something to do with the uh so like how

728
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,839
the UND duration how some have like one

729
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,720
or two um but those would all be

730
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,319
multiples of like whatever is best right

731
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,599
there would be the 16 so like the first

732
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:07,079
one would be like two 16 notes or an E

733
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,720
note so this would be two 16th notes or

734
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,200
uhuh oh so like got that five where

735
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,800
there's one one be one 16th note and

736
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,560
then the six great so let's see what do

737
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,280
you think 44 means everybody 44 right

738
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,000
good M do you want to say something on

739
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,440
that um yeah yeah um basically along

740
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,920
these lines and yeah I think the thing

741
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,680
that we're probably trying to get to now

742
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,960
is that like it doesn't quite seem to

743
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,160
add up if it's 44 on each one with one

744
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,920
um is uh 16th so like there are a lot of

745
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,800
measures with three and I believe it's

746
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,119
two underscores like the the the I'm

747
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,839
sorry to make you point super high maybe

748
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,359
there's an example lower but the the Top

749
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:45,760
Line the the first one it seems like the

750
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:49,440
full um measure yeah yep so it's two

751
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,160
underscores yeah two two which would

752
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,960
imply that they're all quarter nodes if

753
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,520
it's in four4 which means that like and

754
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,160
then the one right below it has the

755
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,960
exact same but like in the last

756
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,240
um with the duration of the coord note

757
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,839
splits it up so those seem like eth

758
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:09,160
notes rather than 16th notes great super

759
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,640
awesome great let's let's do a tiny bit

760
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,440
of the metadata um you can take a guess

761
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,440
what language is the

762
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,640
metadata anybody

763
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:25,040
know see just yeah Jason I this is the

764
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,839
code from the reading Yep this isak code

765
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,560
and what what's the uh isach or Essen is

766
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,119
the the two ways of putting it yep and

767
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,720
um anyone know where Essen is yeah

768
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,640
Germany Germany do we see some German

769
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,560
things good so this is a a very famous

770
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,880
piece and I want to say um as you're

771
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,920
choosing things to represent and

772
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,359
choosing things in it um and Nicholas

773
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,880
cook is amazing I think Nicholas CH

774
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:54,319
chose the absolute worst piece he

775
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,040
possibly could have chosen to be the

776
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,960
demonstration this and I've thought of

777
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,520
switching out

778
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,440
um cut might be it's not sent for cuer

779
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,240
it's the something about the title

780
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:11,359
Germany Germany anyone El

781
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,359
overall it's the Nazi national

782
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,960
anthem so I I wish that he had chosen

783
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,960
better but fortunately if we crop off

784
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,880
the top um it is also the pre-nazi

785
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,119
National Anthem with different words and

786
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,880
the current national anthem and a piece

787
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,480
composed by yoseph Heiden so the

788
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,800
Surprise Symphony composer and I wanted

789
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,000
to um put it up it's rather small might

790
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,720
need to zoom in or or get up but see or

791
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,480
you can look at the article see if you

792
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,319
can re Now read the notation from

793
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,839
hearing this assuming YouTube's going to

794
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:49,680
work this time and this is the modern

795
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:49,680
word

796
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,960
word second

797
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:06,560
line 31 1

798
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:06,560
5 1 2 3 2 4 3

799
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,839
2 oh was that a

800
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,230
[Music]

801
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:17,719
flat might be an otive

802
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,719
[Music]

803
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,640
sign you can hear the sharps are

804
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,119
definitely Sharps those who can hear

805
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,119
secondary

806
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:34,520
[Music]

807
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,790
dominance anyhow we don't have to hear

808
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,359
the

809
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,640
[Music]

810
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,200
rest yeah yeah yeah you win the World

811
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,119
Cup more than us we know

812
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,599
um okay um

813
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,280
so two more two more questions one I

814
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
didn't put on here before we move on to

815
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,160
another topic

816
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,760
um what does comparative

817
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,240
musicology mean and how's it have

818
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,079
anything to do with computational

819
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,920
musicology and that's the main title of

820
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,839
the piece the

821
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,200
article anyone let's take stand take the

822
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,200
first one what is

823
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
comparative

824
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,040
musicology we can probably figure it out

825
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:25,079
from the words so yep I believe it was

826
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,680
like just that concept of comparing

827
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,280
music to each other regardless of where

828
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,880
necessarily far yeah uh so it's it's

829
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,040
comparing pieces of music to each other

830
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,880
but not necessarily you know close

831
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,240
things not oh let's look at the first

832
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,800
movement and compare it to the second

833
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,280
movement but let's look at oh um let's

834
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,920
look at a nationalist song from Germany

835
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,040
and let's look at a nationalist song

836
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,359
from Kenya and see if they have any

837
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:55,240
connection let's look at um oh shoot I

838
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:58,599
forgot to put it into into the slides um

839
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,160
the person uh I BL on her name not

840
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,760
checking my email I I have the picture

841
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:08,760
to put into the slide and I didn't get

842
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:13,079
uh her name is uh trout uh sorry uh yeah

843
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,440
trob um big New York Times obituary and

844
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,119
I have a notification that won't Sandra

845
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,560
CH the Pioneer one of the Pioneers in

846
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,760
the psychology of comp comparative music

847
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,400
uh mus musicology died very recently and

848
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,880
she was the one who famously did

849
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,880
experiments to show that people could

850
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,200
identify here or two songs from the same

851
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,680
culture which one's the lullabi and

852
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,760
which one is not all throughout the

853
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,200
world and this experiment's been um

854
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,680
replicated with other uh musics uh quite

855
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,040
a lot uh recently um over in the lab at

856
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,000
at Harvard but she was a big one so this

857
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,079
notion of looking across

858
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,400
cultures uh anybody take um in class I

859
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:03,319
think a couple people have uh intro to

860
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,760
um to Global Music or World music yeah

861
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:09,119
so great so um did did the word

862
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,000
comparative musicology come up much in

863
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,079
your class not really not really good

864
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,400
the paper it says that that was what

865
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,920
used to be that's what used to be

866
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,319
ethnomusicology the study of music and

867
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,680
cultures and it yeah did you you also

868
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,520
didn't see in your classes yeah so

869
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,359
comparativist approaches is of looking

870
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,079
at things um from here and you know

871
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,800
there and saying what's similar to them

872
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,800
got a um so gave way to Modern

873
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,520
ethnomusicology which is the study of

874
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,559
Music in its culture and so the notion

875
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,599
that um that you go to a culture you get

876
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:50,760
to know the culture very well um and

877
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:54,720
then learn from how the culture itself

878
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:58,000
is describing its music in order to um

879
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,920
say something uh valuable and and that

880
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,160
the more you get to know one culture and

881
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,880
the less you spend time comparing you

882
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,440
know this culture in Paraguay to that

883
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,720
culture in lap land uh the the more that

884
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,000
you just F focus on one place the more

885
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,200
depth of knowledge you'll get and in

886
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,839
part because uh the early negative

887
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:24,599
history of comparative um musicology uh

888
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,800
deserves its very bad rap and we have to

889
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,920
still be really careful for it because

890
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,960
we're always going to be comparing you

891
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,640
know what what are the countries I keep

892
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,760
you know Paraguay and Lapland and uh and

893
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,400
you know Kenya and uh okanawa and Japan

894
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,960
and all these things together and then

895
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,960
we're also going to compare with bein's

896
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,160
Ninth Symphony in order to demonstrate

897
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,359
uh what if you're a German around 1914

898
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,079
or a German around 1933 what is the

899
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,760
conclusion you will always come after

900
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,760
comparing all these

901
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,960
things someone take a guess give a

902
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,880
hypothal mind what's that is the best

903
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,640
the who's is the best your whoever like

904
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,160
you identify with yeah and the people

905
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,040
doing this were mostly white

906
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,599
Europeans so uh the comparativist

907
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:17,000
project while it gathered a lot of data

908
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,160
um we would now say it was embodied in

909
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,880
the uh Narrative of of white supremacy

910
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:27,640
oh now this class can't be shown in in

911
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:30,640
Florida um uh but uh you know it and and

912
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,920
that really really happened and the

913
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,880
issue is um and so ethnomusicology this

914
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:41,240
Focus tried to to say let's stop making

915
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,760
this comparative um type of project so

916
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,200
that um so that we can actually

917
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,640
understand

918
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,079
why individual pieces of music are great

919
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,640
and interesting and valuable and

920
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,440
meaningful and touching to people all

921
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,319
over the world and a lot of people even

922
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,880
in Germany don't like Bean's Ninth

923
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:05,880
Symphony um so working as particular

924
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,559
things and then the irony that comes out

925
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,200
is that the comparativists were still

926
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:13,280
you know looking at a small number of

927
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,960
pieces to compare I mean quite often

928
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,480
look at comparative uh musicology uh

929
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,880
also called systematic at that time um

930
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,359
systematic musicological Works we're

931
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,960
talking about one piece from here one

932
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,319
piece from here because that's all that

933
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,480
people had um and so this go out a style

934
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,839
right

935
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,760
when this thing comes

936
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,240
along and suddenly I mean not not this

937
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,760
particular uh lightweight thing but the

938
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,880
gigantic you know hunking ones that you

939
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,280
can still see in the computer museums

940
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,800
and stuff uh that were able to compare

941
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,079
large numbers of information and at

942
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,839
least encode their

943
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,480
biases if not you know at least you

944
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,200
could see what had been encoded into it

945
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:03,040
so this is where the comparativist

946
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,319
project comes together with the uh

947
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:10,160
computational

948
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:13,240
project but as you can see I mean the

949
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,800
danger is that by using a computer we

950
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:21,559
can still be replicating the kinds of

951
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,559
mistakes that were made quite a bit

952
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,359
ago so we're going to have to be hyper

953
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:32,559
Vigilant the more

954
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:32,559
more hyper Vigilant against

955
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,400
that we're going to be hypervigilant and

956
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,760
it probably means that some sometimes uh

957
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:46,920
if for that we shouldn't be focusing on

958
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,160
um on musical um things for our major

959
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,240
projects that we don't know anything

960
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,480
about so I'm very glad um that the

961
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,000
encoding of of South Indian music that

962
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,200
we have somebody in the group who is a

963
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,800
of expert can can I call you an expert

964
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,760
on on a a very very strong um

965
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,440
understanding this and that we want to

966
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,760
get to know our repertories before we

967
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,119
work too much on them and I think it

968
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,680
kind of comes back to um to this anyhow

969
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,119
even for repertories that um might be

970
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,559
more conventionally studied so we're

971
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,920
going to look at some pieces in a bit um

972
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,640
and uh we're going to start by jumping

973
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,040
into a particular Buck Coral um and I

974
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,640
want everybody to at some point to do

975
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,000
all the things of trying to get into the

976
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,680
style of that piece by hand because we

977
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,240
don't want we want to be able to at

978
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,880
least be a little expert ourselves on a

979
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,720
particular Repertory before we turn it

980
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,280
over to the computer helps to avoid the

981
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,200
gigo or goo problem anyone know what

982
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,800
that is

983
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,599
Gio know Garing garbage out garbage in

984
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,160
equals garbage out so we want to make

985
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,559
sure that we're not um putting garbage

986
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,240
in

987
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,839
great I think I'm going to skip number

988
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,280
three for now we'll do it um the sign

989
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:06,960
score to sound because that one's a

990
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,040
little bit me talking more and let's

991
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,160
jump to a little bit of programming

992
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,400
because we haven't done that in class um

993
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,240
in a while so go ahead and take take a

994
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,800
second or two and um grab a Jupiter

995
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:24,000
notebook while I try to get my screen

996
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,920
set up to have two things at once how

997
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,559
about that um great you've already we're

998
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,800
going to do some unlocking as know that

999
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:34,680
this means that um from here on out

1000
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:38,040
unless you're told otherwise you may use

1001
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,559
um these materials in any problem Set uh

1002
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,160
going forward so you've already unlocked

1003
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,839
the pitch module lowercase p meaning

1004
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:52,040
it's a module and we'll also unlock the

1005
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,040
Note and the duration modules right

1006
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,799
now and we don't even we're not even

1007
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,000
really going to need the pitch or the

1008
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:02,040
duration module so let's start with

1009
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,359
everything on the Note let's um okay I'm

1010
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,200
going to need to get this later

1011
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,559
um

1012
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,599
let's start with one of my favorite

1013
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,240
notes I don't know why C five became one

1014
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,839
of my favorite notes I think it just

1015
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,640
demonstrates something and it's right in

1016
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:21,640
the middle screen good and

1017
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:30,319
um always remember that you can get a

1018
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:33,760
list of um of what any object can do and

1019
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:36,079
by the way you all got its upper and um

1020
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,280
the class rule is I go too fast you say

1021
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,160
slow down okay everybody practice that

1022
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,799
say It Out Slow Down slow down good you

1023
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,880
don't want me to slow down right now but

1024
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:47,960
at some point you will and just shout it

1025
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,319
out great so you can always get this uh

1026
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,920
python unhelpfully uh gives it an

1027
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,799
alphabetical order which means the

1028
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,359
things you don't want to know about the

1029
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:59,040
private things come first but um you can

1030
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,200
see some of the things are happening

1031
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,160
here and very nicely uh you'll see that

1032
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:11,000
duration is one of the attributes or

1033
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:14,799
Properties or something of of a note

1034
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,559
and Pitch is also a property of a note

1035
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:23,400
so that's pretty good

1036
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:26,760
yep so we can get that pitch from the

1037
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,680
note object and it's

1038
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,559
looks pretty similar to um the other

1039
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,559
note

1040
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:40,480
things so can we get the Octave of a

1041
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:43,359
note yes we can can we get the name of

1042
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,720
the note yes we can what are some other

1043
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:49,359
things we did with pitch can we get the

1044
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,559
accidental from a pitch yep can we get

1045
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:55,440
the

1046
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:57,400
accidental of note no we cannot so one

1047
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,799
of the things you'll find in the music

1048
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,880
21 and again music 21 is just one

1049
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:05,400
framework you can use hum drum you can

1050
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:09,040
use build your own um but one of the

1051
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,920
things is it started with uh this that

1052
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,720
there's some things about a pitch that

1053
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,480
seemed like you're going to use so often

1054
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,839
that we might as well put it on the Note

1055
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:24,160
make it a um a shortcut and then a lot

1056
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:26,720
of things just too complicated so you'll

1057
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,920
if you want something deeper go grab it

1058
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,400
from The

1059
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,240
Accidental or to grab it from the pitch

1060
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,520
object

1061
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:41,079
um notes also have a

1062
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,040
duration note. pitch and pitches do not

1063
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:46,480
have a duration so this is sort of going

1064
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,839
into the logical representation mode um

1065
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,440
that some things have durations and some

1066
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:55,480
things

1067
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,160
don't let's see what we can um do with

1068
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,559
this let's let's look at the duration

1069
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,520
since we haven't looked at the duration

1070
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,520
module

1071
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,920
yet or the duration

1072
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:10,799
class okay so we have a duration and we

1073
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,559
can see some of the things um duration.

1074
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:15,920
almond unfortunately I did not go with

1075
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:21,040
that great idea uh what anyone remember

1076
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:23,440
what I said I went with boring term

1077
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:27,839
type so everything starts off as a

1078
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,839
quarter note but we can make it

1079
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,640
half

1080
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,000
and remember early on in the semester we

1081
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,119
talked about representations a duration

1082
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,640
uh before it was a duration of one now

1083
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:47,720
it's some sort of a duration of two two

1084
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,960
whats could be a lot of things could be

1085
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,720
2 seconds with a tempo of 60 could be

1086
00:52:50,960 --> 00:53:00,000
two beats two ticks

1087
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:03,799
um music 21 has chosen to represent

1088
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:09,000
everything in numbers of quarter

1089
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:11,359
notes so duration is one um duration of

1090
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,079
two is a half

1091
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:18,559
note

1092
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:18,559
let's have dots zero so let's add some

1093
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:27,119
dots and now we added six dots to the

1094
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:31,799
notes um and we get something

1095
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,720
like like this um my favorite random MIT

1096
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:36,400
thing that you all can figure out based

1097
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,520
on that uh thing

1098
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:45,319
what what is the limit of half note as

1099
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,319
the dots approaches Infinity

1100
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,680
sorry whole note good good yall can play

1101
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,079
with the Easter egg and set the um dots

1102
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,040
to Infinity later and see what happens

1103
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:58,720
um okay

1104
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,160
so we have some of these things let's

1105
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,640
put the dots back down to I don't know

1106
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,599
something

1107
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,079
manageable and quarter

1108
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:12,400
length each of these things affects each

1109
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,240
other and they're almost all setable so

1110
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,359
that can be helpful in your programming

1111
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:21,119
like

1112
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:21,119
3.5 and now we get that it's a double

1113
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:28,160
dotted and um probably a mistake on my

1114
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,520
original part but everything U most of

1115
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,799
these objects are are mutable so if we

1116
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,760
go back to the original and duration

1117
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:39,640
it's still now has the quarter length so

1118
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:42,799
you can change the duration on the side

1119
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:46,160
similarly with pitch do

1120
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:50,079
um pitch.

1121
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:54,000
Step it's already C we'll make it a

1122
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:57,040
d and now we've changed the step of the

1123
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,480
pitch to D but not change it's

1124
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,400
accidental and now this is still on here

1125
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,880
give everyone a second or two to catch

1126
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,960
up I'll make it a little small smaller

1127
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,000
so that any parts that people have

1128
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,119
missed you don't have to you don't have

1129
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,400
to write down everything that I write

1130
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,640
down uh only write things down as

1131
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,359
they're helpful for you to finger memory

1132
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,039
remember

1133
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,839
it okay um that's all I'm going to talk

1134
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:27,079
about with unlocking notes and durations

1135
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:29,039
at this point um I'll don't think I've

1136
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:31,640
put a per a prominent enough link but

1137
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,599
you can Google it music 21 has a users

1138
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,880
guide and so you've kind of gone through

1139
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,680
chapters one through two um in this

1140
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,839
class so far but let's let's unlock some

1141
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,039
other

1142
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,720
things uh

1143
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,520
unlocking

1144
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:52,440
scores so we're going to give you your

1145
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:55,480
first larger representation things and

1146
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,920
to do this we're going to um from music

1147
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,880
21

1148
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,520
import something called stream and

1149
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,839
something called

1150
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,480
Corpus oops no

1151
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,920
trailing um I was putting that there

1152
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,440
because you can also invert import sign

1153
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,319
called converter I'm not going to talk

1154
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:16,039
about it um but converter is a way of

1155
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:19,880
loading things from your hard drive

1156
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:22,359
Corpus uses um a batteries included set

1157
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,440
of about 8,000 pieces that comes that

1158
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:27,440
come with music 21 so there's about

1159
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:31,160
8,000 pieces in there and and we'll grab

1160
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:34,960
one of them and when I'm not um thinking

1161
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,920
very much I apologize I go to this Bo so

1162
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,960
we'll load from the Corpus we're going

1163
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:46,240
to parse meaning make sense of the of

1164
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:48,960
the um representation Bach bwv

1165
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:54,280
66.6 bwv means the

1166
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:57,599
Bess the box work um uh index and by Bo

1167
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:59,960
in this case um I mean Johan Sebastian

1168
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,200
Bach daddy Bach there's some other boxs

1169
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:06,839
in there and this is um the work number

1170
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,440
66 6 movement um it's the one that we're

1171
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:13,480
going to use quite a bit because it's

1172
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:16,920
the smallest uh shortest Corral he

1173
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,039
wrote and um what I'm going to ask you

1174
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,359
to

1175
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:24,280
do over the next couple classes as part

1176
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:28,240
of the avoiding garbage in garbage out

1177
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,480
want you to learn to sing Your Part from

1178
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,480
this

1179
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,680
Coral can you can you do that can you go

1180
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:40,039
to the piano and match pitch on one of

1181
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:42,680
the parts if you're really not um you

1182
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:45,440
feeling very confident you're singing

1183
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:48,400
you can do the soprano part at whatever

1184
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,520
um octave is most comfortable but it

1185
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,839
would be nice to be able to sing this as

1186
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:56,240
a group and we'll come back to this one

1187
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:57,599
um next class so you now have sorry

1188
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,640
should have slowed down I was like

1189
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:03,240
talking about something else B we're

1190
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:04,480
going to store this piece as a variable

1191
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,559
and one of the things you're going to

1192
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,880
find very helpful is do show um can you

1193
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,559
raise your hand if you have gotten

1194
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:16,480
everything installed so that you can see

1195
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:19,160
uh scores when you call show on things

1196
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,720
anybody anybody still having some

1197
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,760
difficulty that on okay great super

1198
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,880
we'll make sure that we can uh get that

1199
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,280
up and um and and see if we can uh get

1200
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,079
that straightened out there were some

1201
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,680
some helpful hints put onto one of the

1202
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,839
discussion points about um dealing with

1203
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:41,000
M score 4 but want to get that yeah when

1204
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:43,039
we get this um this a notebook chance

1205
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,680
yeah I can make sure to do that just if

1206
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,559
there's something that I create in the

1207
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,039
middle of class and it's not a one

1208
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,520
button thing and you don't see it by uh

1209
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,319
9:00 a.m. the next day just drop me a

1210
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,720
line but I'll try to do that and

1211
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:57,359
sometimes I'll give you the cleaned up

1212
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,640
one I should have a script on my other

1213
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,039
monitor but I'm not uh getting it now

1214
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,440
great so let's look at that boach thing

1215
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:07,359
it is

1216
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:11,359
something in the project is music 21

1217
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:16,200
stream is a what is it Shout It

1218
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:18,960
Out module and score is a class class

1219
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,400
class good so this is an object of class

1220
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,119
score in the Stream module in the music

1221
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,480
21 package project whatever you call it

1222
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,839
and this is the particular memory

1223
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,440
location that you can hack on my

1224
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:33,440
computer to uh to deal with the stream

1225
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:37,480
we can change we'll just make this

1226
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:40,440
change its ID to BU short something like

1227
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,400
that and then we'll see something nicer

1228
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,119
than just a memory location that's

1229
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:49,160
sometimes helpful okay

1230
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:52,599
so this we call at the beginning of the

1231
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,799
uh semester we have how many things are

1232
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:57,119
in bck this was a trick question on the

1233
00:59:54,799 --> 01:00:01,079
first day you all stuck around well a

1234
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:04,480
lot of trick questions and

1235
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:07,400
um there are six things in the bo what

1236
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,599
what's what are two basic answers that

1237
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,160
you thought might be the um a good

1238
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:15,839
answer to how many things there are in

1239
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,839
the Box ballpark

1240
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:24,520
figures 100 100 yep why maybe about 100

1241
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,119
what's notes notes good what's another

1242
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:30,440
number that you might have thought could

1243
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:33,559
be there four four why number of parts

1244
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:37,319
of parts good so let's see what those

1245
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:40,000
things are um well one of the things

1246
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:41,680
streams um scores are a type of stream

1247
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,640
everything in there's a type of stream

1248
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:49,960
can be treated like um like lists so you

1249
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,920
can index them get what zeroth object is

1250
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:56,720
get the first

1251
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:57,880
object ah there's our part second

1252
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,680
and so

1253
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,799
on so what's that last object everyone

1254
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,920
remember python give negative one

1255
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:10,200
indexing uh we have something that says

1256
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:13,200
all of these soprano Alto tenor base are

1257
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,640
all have these what do you call it this

1258
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,960
pretty

1259
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,760
little thing around them so that's how

1260
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,240
we get six things we have metadata which

1261
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,920
is data about data that is usually

1262
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,799
having the title of it so and things

1263
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,520
like that we'll get to met dat later but

1264
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:32,200
I know you want to get so let's see

1265
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,280
what's what's an index I can use to get

1266
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,160
something that might have notes in it

1267
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,880
zero probably not negative one which one

1268
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,880
do we want to look

1269
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:49,039
at give me a number to put in here two

1270
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,720
two okay so two is in this case the Alto

1271
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:53,480
part and you would think if you don't

1272
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:58,000
get that metadata as zero that this

1273
01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:00,160
would be um this might be uh you know

1274
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,359
that one indexed or something right one

1275
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:06,480
is soprano 2 but no it's zero index but

1276
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:08,279
the zero is metadata um there might be

1277
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,400
multiple things at the beginning not

1278
01:02:08,279 --> 01:02:13,119
just one metadata there could be more

1279
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,240
could be metadata lists so it's you

1280
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:19,880
might not always get this so you could

1281
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:23,359
do something like like this for B for

1282
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:27,680
thing I always use thing in b um because

1283
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:31,240
I don't know what it is if is instance

1284
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:33,319
thing music21 Dost

1285
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:36,119
stream.

1286
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:40,000
part print

1287
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:43,240
thing oops what did I do um I

1288
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,880
didn't sorry streamed up part because I

1289
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:51,160
imported that um I imported stream into

1290
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:53,279
it so that can be one way to get this

1291
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:56,279
I'm going to tell you all of the most

1292
01:02:53,279 --> 01:03:00,640
General ways of doing things now so that

1293
01:02:56,279 --> 01:03:04,480
it sort of forms a mental habit but um

1294
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,799
but we want to um but just just to know

1295
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,279
you will learn some shortcuts so you

1296
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:11,799
won't need to have to code all this uh

1297
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:15,559
later great so now we have all the parts

1298
01:03:11,799 --> 01:03:19,200
what do you um let's do this we we got

1299
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:22,559
the bach two let's see four thing in

1300
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,400
Bach two that's let just call that Alto

1301
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:29,000
let's call that Alto right Alto equals

1302
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,920
Bach two for thing in Alto I always like

1303
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,680
good naming see I'm calling it thing

1304
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:34,680
thing's the best naming when you don't

1305
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,119
know what something is yet suppose you

1306
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:40,680
could call it L for element or something

1307
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:43,680
print thing and what and when we call

1308
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,799
from the very fast thing for stay what

1309
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:50,240
it's going to

1310
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:51,359
be so it's a bunch of measures but also

1311
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,640
an

1312
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,200
instrument I think that that's been

1313
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,279
fixed in the latest version and it looks

1314
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:01,039
like everything else but yeah so we have

1315
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:03,440
an instrument there so we can do this

1316
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:07,440
again I'm going to copy I just copied

1317
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,760
here I'm going to go here and paste um

1318
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,559
and we'll again do that is instance

1319
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:19,640
checking if is instance that means is a

1320
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:21,400
member of this class thing um stream.

1321
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,160
measure

1322
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:27,160
print thing okay now we've gotten just

1323
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,680
the measures and

1324
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:35,240
and we can get um oh I don't know

1325
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:38,440
measure 2 equals Alto three I think we

1326
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:41,200
got that is that I guess right okay and

1327
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,720
we can keep writing the same type of

1328
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,920
thing for thing

1329
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,920
in in

1330
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,920
M2 we don't need that because we're

1331
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,039
already in a measure and finally we get

1332
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:57,640
to

1333
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,640
notes finally we get to notes

1334
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:04,760
so that's where I'm going to end um this

1335
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:08,559
part now um that I've given you a very

1336
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:13,680
tedious way to get two notes from a

1337
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:16,079
score that you go through all the

1338
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,520
parts um you go through everything

1339
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:21,559
that's in the score find the things that

1340
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,839
are parts and then you could do a next

1341
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:27,839
iteration on here another uh for Loop

1342
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:30,039
another if go through each of the parts

1343
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:33,920
and figure out everything that's a

1344
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:35,319
measure and what oh sorry everything

1345
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,760
that's a measure and go through each of

1346
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:40,359
the measures and do this a for Loop

1347
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,920
within a for Loop within a for Loop um

1348
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:45,160
but we're going to learn some better

1349
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,520
ways to do this later but I want to

1350
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:49,680
leave you at least two days with trying

1351
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:52,480
to do everything the hard way before we

1352
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:55,359
start to get to the easier ways um so

1353
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,039
you can do this so that's that your only

1354
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:01,000
assign assignments continue working with

1355
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:03,760
um your um on your problem sets and to

1356
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,760
learn to sing your little part of bwv

1357
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,760
66.6
