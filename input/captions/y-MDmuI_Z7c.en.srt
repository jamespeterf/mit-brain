1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,720
So, one of the genes that we started

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,160
working on turned out um after we had

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,240
sort of figured out that it was a

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,480
synaptic protein and that it regulates

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,599
synaptic strength through modulating

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,160
receptors at the syninnapse, uh it

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,080
turned out in a

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,279
uh a G-W was or a genetic screen for uh

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,080
genes that um confer risk for

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,760
neuroscychiatric for uh schizophrenia,

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,520
depression

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,719
uh bipolar. Uh it turned out as the

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,800
number two hit for bipolar disorder. And

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,719
basically people see this hit, they have

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,559
no idea what it does. They look up what

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
the gene is and it turns out to be this

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,399
synaptic protein that we've been working

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,680
on. And um

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,680
it's unusual in the sense that many

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
genetic hits for neuroscychiatric

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
disorders

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,559
uh because they're also symptomatically

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,399
have features that are common. Also

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,360
genetically there's a lot of overlap

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,920
between schizophrenia bipolar and uh

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
major depression. But the gene that we

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,880
were working on, the protein that it

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,400
encodes, um that risk is really specific

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,759
for bipolar and it doesn't cross over to

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,880
the other two. So that in itself is um

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,479
is unusual and very interesting.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,720
Um and then you know what one of my

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,159
postocs said like let's see what this

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,040
protein looks like in you know patients

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
from bipolar patients and I said oh I

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm not sure we'll see anything because

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,680
sometimes mutations they affect function

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
of the proteins but the amount of

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,399
protein is the same so just looking at

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
what the protein levels it's not going

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,360
to tell us anything but you know people

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,399
in your lab don't always listen to you

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,640
thankfully

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,000
Um and she basically we ordered all

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:03,360
these brains from uh um these uh um data

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
banks that have uh patients and we

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,319
ordered schizophrenia and major

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,280
depression and bipolar and of course uh

49
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,360
healthy controls and we looked at them

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,840
and sure enough in the bipolar patients

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,360
specifically the level of this protein

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,560
that we had discovered um was much lower

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,959
than in any of the other groups.

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,440
Um and then that really kind of changed

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,400
our thinking because we started thinking

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
well the amounts of protein means that

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,319
potentially the mutation is not related

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,800
to the protein itself but to the

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,400
regulatory region that um

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,400
that sets the amount of protein being

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
made or the transcription of the gene.

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
And so we started looking at the

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,040
regulatory domain and we could identify

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,800
mutations in the regulatory domain from

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,120
patients that affected the

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,080
transcription.

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,680
And so and then we saw that there was a

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
uh

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,920
there was a correlation between the

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,560
presence of these mutations in the

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
promoter or the regulatory region and

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,480
the level of proteins in these patients.

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
Um so now we're thinking about using

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,159
that kind of as a diagnostic tool

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,200
potentially

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,560
and um so that's one of the projects

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,200
that I think is super exciting in terms

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,680
of translational potential

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:38,239
um and uh um where we also can have a

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,519
test a lab test which is sort of a

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,120
transcriptional test where we can insert

82
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
any human mutation

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,000
into our assay.

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,040
Um where we have the promoter of this

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,799
gene uh the human promoter that we have

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,640
in front of a reporter that we can

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,640
monitor and we can test its

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
functionality.
