1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,600
All right, with that,
I'm going to get started.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,060
Welcome to the immunology
breakout session.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,880
My name is Stephanie
Springer, and it's

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,300
my pleasure to chair
this session here

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,775
on immunology at MIT.

7
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:16,670

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,520
What is immunology and
why do we care about it

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,370
in health and disease?

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,700
So with that, I would like to
give a very brief introduction

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,220
on what the immune system
is and why we care about it

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,720
when we think about physiology
as well as disease states.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,640
The immune system, and
this is a slide from class,

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,290
can be very simply
depicted as a seesaw.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,230
And this is a very
simple oversimplification

16
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,030
where the immune
system is trying

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,780
to balance fighting
pathogens, but also avoiding

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,800
to attack the body itself.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,210
However, as I just said,
this is a very drastic

20
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,580
oversimplification of what our
immune system is actually doing.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,430
So this seesaw is
probably more accurate

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,160
because we are not
living in isolation

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,720
and our immune system is
not acting in isolation.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,400
Lifestyle, diet, stress,
all of these factors

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,720
affect how our immune
system is working,

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,210
and diseases push our immune
system every day to react,

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,970
and our immune system
still has to keep

28
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,120
at bay not attacking ourselves.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,490
And an imbalance within
the immune system

30
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,030
can cause diseases,
but likewise,

31
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,440
allow the resolution of diseases
like pathogenic infections.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,390
And it can also affect our
health and our well-being,

33
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,770
and likewise, our
well-being, being happy,

34
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,860
will affect our immune system.

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,330
Now, this is a human
body depicted as dots.

36
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,880
One dot is 10 to the
power of 9 cells,

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,590
and one large square
is 1,000 dots.

38
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,510
Now, how big is
our immune system

39
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,930
if this is our entire body?

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,020
You see here in red
and in dark red,

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,180
the two major subtypes of
cells that make up our body.

42
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,252
The light red cells
are erythrocytes.

43
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,710
These are bone
marrow-derived cells

44
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,080
that carry around our
oxygen. They also have

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,830
some level of immune function.

46
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,550
The dark colored cells
are all bone marrow

47
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,360
derived immune cells.

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,830
So these are the cells that
fight pathogens, fight cancer,

49
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,950
but also are responsible for
inducing autoimmune diseases.

50
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,910
And as you can see here, in
contrast to the other organs,

51
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,570
our immune system
is, by and large,

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,140
the largest organ in our body.

53
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,420
It is likewise not a
single solid organ.

54
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,580
It is disseminated
throughout our body.

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,440
It has a network of nodes,
hubs, meeting points

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,390
called lymph nodes that
are spread throughout,

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,300
and this is where our
immune cells actually

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,750
communicate with one another.

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,750
And our immune system can
be very broadly subdivided

60
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,730
into different elements.

61
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,590
We have the innate
immune system,

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,950
and this is the part of the
immune system that senses

63
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,290
if there's danger somewhere.

64
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,350
And then, we have the adaptive
immune system in, specifically,

65
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,840
two arms, the cellular
arm of the immune system

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,380
and the humoral arm of the
immune system mediated by T

67
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,490
cells and B cells respectively.

68
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,360
And these are the cells
that instill memory

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,660
in our immune system.

70
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,540
Meaning, if you get a
prophylactic vaccine

71
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,520
against flu, these
are the cells that

72
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,130
memorize that they've
seen flu before

73
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,810
and are better at eliminating
the virus once you see it.

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,600
These two arms of the
adaptive immune system

75
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,170
act slightly differently.

76
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,180
The T cells recognize
specific patterns on cells

77
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,200
and eliminate those cells
versus the humoral arm

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,720
is mediated mostly
by antibodies.

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
And throughout this
session, we will

80
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,540
hear from experts across
all of these areas

81
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,930
of our immune system.

82
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,030
Specifically, Facundo
will talk to us

83
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,520
about the humoral immune system.

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,220
Aroup, later on, will talk
about B cell responses.

85
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,300
Jessica will talk about
the innate immune system

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,370
and how patterns are hardwired.

87
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,880
Hari will put many
of these contexts

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,910
into, one, how cells
interact with one another.

89
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,400
And Michael, at the
very end of the session,

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,540
will talk to us how we can
use those basic principles

91
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,470
and use it to engineer
our immune system.

92
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,980
This is the summary of
these five professors

93
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,460
titles, which I won't
repeat for time constraints.

94
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,660
And I'm really excited
about this session.

95
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,600
And with that, I
would like to welcome

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,032
Facundo Batista as our
first speaker to the stage.

97
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:42,780
[APPLAUSE]

98
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,290
Yes, good morning, everyone.

99
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,750
And as Stephanie said, my
name is Facundo and yeah,

100
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,710
there we go.

101
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,360
And that is a typical
Argentinian name.

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,220
And that is why I am going to be
speaking with his strange accent

103
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,050
all the way.

104
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,040
So when people is
asked about what

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,440
has been the best biotechnology
discovery in history,

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,660
many will argue that it
will be wine or beer.

107
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,960
I, and many others, will argue
that it is going to be vaccines.

108
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,590
And essentially, vaccines
has been the source

109
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,340
of protection over the
last just five decades

110
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,910
and saving lives for about
150 million human beings.

111
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,370
And although we know
that vaccines work,

112
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,290
we don't know how they work.

113
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,710
But we know that these
molecules, the antibodies that

114
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,350
are able to bind pathogens
and trigger function,

115
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,930
they are the main
responsibilities

116
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,840
of active protection or
a correlation with them.

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,090
And antibodies are
not responsible

118
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,250
of active protection,
but they are also

119
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,330
critical in terms
of treating disease.

120
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,720
And I am using this example in--

121
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,680
just to point out that
in giving an antibody

122
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,210
to a person, an antibody that
recognizes a malaria parasite,

123
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,580
it will protect
that person for one

124
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,550
year just by injecting
the antibody into them.

125
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,540
And these antibodies
have been the basis

126
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,900
of many therapeutic cures to
cancer and infectious disease,

127
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,650
and as such, it makes them a
key target for bioindustry.

128
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,710
And the industry of
antibodies is, at the moment,

129
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,540
in the order of
$300 million a year

130
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,470
and is estimated
to be in one dollar

131
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,060
billion in about 10 years.

132
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,480
That is why we are particularly
interested in trying

133
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,230
to understand how these
antibodies are generated.

134
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,150
And in these regards,
antibodies are

135
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,340
produced by a particular type
of cells that are plasma cells.

136
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,640
And these cells are
really antibody factories

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,410
that they produce
millions of molecules

138
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,660
per hour every single day.

139
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,050
But plasma cells are the
result of a particular pattern

140
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,410
of differentiation of B cells,
and antibodies initially

141
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,300
are produced on the
surface of naive B cells.

142
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,880
And those cells are
able to recognize

143
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,430
either viruses or either
antigens that they

144
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,050
are given through vaccination.

145
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,620
And once they do that, they
will do something rather unique.

146
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,810
They will get together
and start to divide

147
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,150
and they will form these
that are in structures that

148
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,870
are known as germinal centers.

149
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,833
And here, they will
do something magic.

150
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,250
What they are going
to be doing is

151
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,740
they are going to mutate
the original gene that

152
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,030
carries that protein in order
to make that antibody much more

153
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,300
potent over time.

154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,960
And this antibody will
become much more specific

155
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,560
for a particular
antigen or a tumor.

156
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,820
And the way that this
happens is that, initially,

157
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,540
when we get vaccinated
or infection,

158
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,130
we produce very low affinity
or not high quality antibodies.

159
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,280
But then, because of the
germinal center formation

160
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,780
and this specific
maturation that I mentioned,

161
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,650
the antibodies gain high
affinity and specificity

162
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,065
over the differentiation
of the cells that

163
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:45,630
then relies into the long-term
survival of this antibody

164
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,150
production.

165
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,817
And just to give you
an idea, we are all

166
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,650
being vaccinated
for measles here.

167
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,580
And those antibodies that
are-- those plasma cells that

168
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,920
are generated in the very
early stage of our life,

169
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,660
they will live with us for about
80 years until we pass away.

170
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,540
So my lab, what we do is we
ask fundamental questions

171
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,570
about how B cells, biology,
and antibody responses happen.

172
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,540
And indeed, I will
show some examples

173
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,250
on one particular
discovery that we

174
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,590
did that really kind of
enabled us to do really

175
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,840
absolutely cutting edge.

176
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,480
What we have been
doing over the years

177
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,200
is to manipulate or try to
create a humanized mouse.

178
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,680
In this mouse, what
we do is we change

179
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,690
the genetic code in
different chromosomes

180
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,240
to now express B-cell
receptors, or antibody

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,610
on the surface of naive cells,
that are not any longer mouse,

182
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,169
but they are humanized.

183
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,309
And as such, we can study the
immune resposne of these mice

184
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,850
as these B cells will
be practically human.

185
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,940
So we use this technology
to develop and unravel

186
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,200
several key questions in
terms of B-cell maturation

187
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,180
and biology.

188
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,420
And one of them was,
for example, this

189
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,930
is how a plasma cell looks.

190
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,390
And as I told you,
this plasma cell

191
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,930
lived with a very long
time in our models.

192
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,680
And these plasma cells
are able to produce

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,020
about 100 million molecules
of antibody per cell per hour.

194
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,230
And they need to produce
that over the course

195
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,650
of many, many years.

196
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,130
And in order to do this, what
we show, in particular, a PhD

197
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,620
student in the lab,
Stephanie, what is--

198
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,900
Sophie, what she has done
is she has particularly

199
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,695
looked into the code of
translation of that protein.

200
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,320
For those of you that
are not familiar,

201
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
proteins are
expressed as an RNA.

202
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,270
They are translated
by this adapter that

203
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,770
constitutes the amino acid, or
bring the amino acids to this

204
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,600
that they are the
shape of the protein.

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,560
And what Sophie found
was that these tRNAs

206
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,530
are critical in
programming the plasma

207
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,760
cell to produce this large
level of antibodies there.

208
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,840
We are not only look
into plasma cells,

209
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,980
we also look very much into what
antibodies do into our response.

210
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,400
And I know Arup is going to
talk a little more about this.

211
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,790
But essentially, what
we show is that we try

212
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,450
to represent this as a castle.

213
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,630
Germinal centers, that
I mentioned to you

214
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,820
before, they exist in the body.

215
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,920
And antibodies that
we produce, they

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,190
are able to block the
entrance of particular cells

217
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,220
or to facilitate the
entrance of others.

218
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,270
But we don't do
only B cell biology,

219
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,020
but we try to understand how
we can translate this B cell

220
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,570
biology and knowing
in antibody responses

221
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,360
to try to inform
vaccine design and offer

222
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,140
novel therapeutic development.

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,900
And in this, I will give
two examples of those.

224
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,800
We have used this-- what we
call this mouse machine that I

225
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,350
mentioned to you, mouse
that produce antibodies

226
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,650
that look like humans.

227
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,940
And what we have shown through
immunizing or vaccinating

228
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,460
those mice that we can produce
much more potent antibodies

229
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,680
that they can now
protect us to malaria.

230
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,350
And this is of
particular function

231
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,670
because-- a particularly
important one

232
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,128
because if we have
an antibody that

233
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:39,750
works much better
than another, that

234
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,650
decrease the cost of the drug
by several orders of magnitude.

235
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,130
Similarly, we have been
involved in a large consortia

236
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,740
to try to use this humanized
mouse model to characterize

237
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,980
different antigens.

238
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,620
And this is the
surface of the HIV.

239
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,440
And these are different
antibodies bind

240
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,250
to different portions of HIV.

241
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,640
And in our collaboration,
what we have been using

242
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,020
is our humanized mouse models
to enable clinical trials

243
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,820
for the production
on an HIV vaccine.

244
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,440
And in that regards,
in particular,

245
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,810
we have taken these
immunogens to the clinic.

246
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,150
One clinical trial is going
to start in next January,

247
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,350
and this relates, in particular,
to this portion of the protein

248
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,600
and the production of
antibodies against that protein

249
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,060
or another ongoing clinical
trial together in collaboration

250
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,980
with Moderna that
is particularly

251
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,100
focusing in how we
can develop antibodies

252
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,730
that recognize this part of
the protein of the virus.

253
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,365
So with that in
mind, actually, I

254
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:37,240
would like to introduce
the next speaker that

255
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,460
is Arup Chakraborty, and
he will be digging more

256
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,946
into the B-cell response
and the biology of it.

257
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:55,540
[APPLAUSE]

258
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,410
Thank you, Facundo.

259
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,110

260
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,750
So as Facundo mentioned,
it is estimated

261
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:07,120
that vaccination has saved about
150 million lives in the past 50

262
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,350
years.

263
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,810
But we don't have
effective vaccines

264
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,830
against highly mutable viruses.

265
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:21,500
For example, we don't have a
universal vaccine for the flu.

266
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,870
So every year we guess which
strains may evolve and design

267
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,070
a new vaccine.

268
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:32,140
And the situation is similar
now for SARS-COV-2, which

269
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,410
causes the COVID-19 disease.

270
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,810
The way to better confront
these scourges this

271
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,610
is to design universal or
variant proof vaccines.

272
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,730
And a part of our
work is focused

273
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,390
on trying to address fundamental
scientific questions which,

274
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,960
if answered, would aid
the pursuit of this quest.

275
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,040
And toward this end,
we bring together

276
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,530
physics-based
computations and machine

277
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:08,600
learning along with trust
tests of predictions in animal

278
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,420
models and clinical data.

279
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,050
These latter efforts are
carried out in collaboration

280
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,230
with basic and
clinical immunologists.

281
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,280
And for the vignettes that
I shall highlight today,

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,700
the labs--

283
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,660
the collaborating labs were
led by these individuals.

284
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,980
Now, as Facundo mentioned,
upon infection or vaccination,

285
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,180
antibodies are generated by a
Darwinian evolutionary process

286
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,090
that occurs in germinal
centers, or GCs.

287
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,000
Herein, B cells evolve
by mutation and selection

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,110
to bind more strongly
to the antigen, which

289
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,180
is displayed in these GCs.

290
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,330
And that is why, as time ensues,
the memory cells and plasma

291
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,530
cells and antibodies that you
generate become more potent.

292
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,560
Now, upon re-exposure
to the antigen,

293
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,420
the existing memory cells
are first rapidly expanded

294
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,510
to create a wave
of antibodies that

295
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,940
is meant to confer protection.

296
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,340
But new GCs over formed--

297
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,650
also form, but over
much longer time

298
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,870
scales to generate more
memory B cells and antibodies.

299
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,600
Now, the first vignette
that I will describe

300
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,590
stemmed from our asking why
three shots of the COVID

301
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,420
vaccines protect better against
the highly mutated variant

302
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,850
like Omicron, while two shots do
not even though all three shots

303
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,940
encode for the Wuhan
original strain of the virus.

304
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,090
So this Darwinian
process is driven

305
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,380
by antigen displayed in GCs.

306
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,940
How does it get there?

307
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,010
Circulating antibodies
bind to the antigen

308
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,750
and deposit it there.

309
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,650
Now, when you get
your first shot,

310
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,810
all you have in you circulating
are generic, weakly binding

311
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,890
small numbers of antibodies
that bind to very little antigen

312
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,840
and deposit them there
before the antigen degrades.

313
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,180
And you can see this by
imaging lymph nodes of monkeys

314
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,630
after the first shot.

315
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,810
And here you see there's
hardly any antigen there.

316
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:31,530
So if you think of the antigen
as the prey and the B cells

317
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,390
as the predators in this
Darwinian process, when there's

318
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,720
very little prey, only the best
predators are going to survive.

319
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,330
And that is why,
after the first shot,

320
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,110
the antibodies and memory
cells that you generate

321
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,780
are those that
initially bind strongly

322
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,800
to the spike of
the virus and bind

323
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,090
to regions called
immunodominant.

324
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,990
And here I have depicted
these antibodies

325
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,970
binding to the
spike of SARS-COV-2.

326
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,140
Now, after the second shot,
the corresponding memory cells

327
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,410
are rapidly expanded
to generate antibodies.

328
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,700
Now, the regions
that are in red,

329
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,810
they are mutated in Omicron
compared to the Wuhan strain.

330
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,550
And you see they
are in the binding

331
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,240
footprints of these antibodies.

332
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,320
And so they're not very
effective against Omicron.

333
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,930
But after the second shot
you also form new GCs,

334
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,200
but now you've got
circulating antibodies

335
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,910
that are antigen specific.

336
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,580
And so they bind to and deposit
lots of antigen in the GCs,

337
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,510
and you can see this by
imaging the monkey lymph

338
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,900
nodes after the second dose.

339
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,317
You see there are
lots of antigen.

340
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:42,100
Now, when there's lots of
prey, they're not so good.

341
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,620
Predators can also
survive and evolve.

342
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,360
And so antibodies that bind
more weakly initially to regions

343
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,950
called subdominant that are not
mutated in Omicron can evolve.

344
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,820
And this effect is
further amplified

345
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,370
because these
antibodies that bind

346
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,880
to these immunodominant regions
can enter GCs, bind to them,

347
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,390
thereby masking
them and effectively

348
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,930
elevating the amount of these
subdominant regions that

349
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,099
are present.

350
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,950
So now the memory cells that
bind to these regions that

351
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,349
are not mutated in Omicron
that you've created

352
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,220
are rapidly expanded
and become antibodies

353
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,650
that are protected
against SARS-COV-2--

354
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,530
against the Omicron strain.

355
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,740
Similar mechanisms are at
play for our demonstration

356
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,800
that instead of giving
the vaccine, as just one

357
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,070
shot as a bolus, as
is normally done,

358
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,995
if you distribute the
same amount of antigen

359
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:44,750
over seven days in seven doses
over an escalating pattern, then

360
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,500
you get lots more antigen than
just the bolus, which leads

361
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,490
to a more potent antibody
response compared

362
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,660
to the bolus in mice.

363
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,040
And very recently, this
has been recapitulated

364
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,880
in a human clinical trial.

365
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,490
So from computational biophysics
to the clinic, if you like.

366
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,560
But seven days, seven
shots is not practical.

367
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,860
And so by better understanding
these feedback loops,

368
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,720
we have now designed
a two-shot regime that

369
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,140
puts a lot of antigen
on the surface in the GC

370
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:24,050
and you get potent responses,
just like the seven day one.

371
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,230
We are now trying to explore
how similar mechanisms can

372
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,420
be leveraged such that antibody
therapy can potentially

373
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,670
lead to a cure for HIV.

374
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,810
And finally, let me note
that we have computationally

375
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,030
designed nanoparticles
that display spikes

376
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,800
of diverse sarbecoviruses,
the virus family from which

377
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,130
SARS-COV-2 is derived.

378
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,480
And this is the potency
of the antibody response

379
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,020
in mice to several
sarbecoviruses

380
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,400
that may spill
over from animals.

381
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,360
And you see that our
computationally designed one

382
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,760
is more potent than the
state of the art nanoparticle

383
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,190
and much better than the
bivalent vaccine that many of us

384
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,210
have taken.

385
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,220
Thank you for listening.

386
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,010
And our next speaker will
be Professor Jessica Stark.

387
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,429
[APPLAUSE]

388
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,360

389
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,500
Thanks and good
morning, everyone.

390
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,390
It's a privilege to be here and
to share our group's perspective

391
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,130
on understanding and
engineering immune responses.

392
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,740
I want to start by first
affirming your choice

393
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,080
to come to this breakout
session because we really

394
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,840
are in a very exciting
time for immunology

395
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,390
in the midst of an immunological
revolution in medicine.

396
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,100
We now understand that there are
a wide variety of human diseases

397
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,260
and conditions that can
be effectively treated

398
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,810
by harnessing the immune system.

399
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,190
As we've heard from
Arup and Facundo,

400
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,390
we've been able to use
vaccination to prevent or even

401
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,730
eliminate infectious
disease by teaching

402
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,040
the immune system to recognize
and respond to pathogens.

403
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,800
In cancer, we've
been able to use

404
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,160
immunotherapies to elicit
decades long remission

405
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,950
from disease.

406
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,800
Really, the closest we've
come to a cancer cure.

407
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,460
And nevertheless,
we remain limited

408
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,590
in the kinds of conditions
that we can treat

409
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,940
and the number of patients that
we can help with immunotherapy.

410
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,570
And so we still
need new paradigms

411
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,250
to harness the immune
system if we're

412
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,340
going to realize the full
potential of immunology

413
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,620
for human health.

414
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,790
We see an opportunity to target
cell surface sugars called

415
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:46,130
glycans as an untapped axis of
regulation in the immune system.

416
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,470
Every cell in your body, and
in fact, every cell on Earth

417
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,620
is coated with a thick
layer of glycans,

418
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,800
and these glycans exert
influence in nearly

419
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,380
every immunological process.

420
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,990
Glycans can directly control
immune cell function.

421
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,170
They can activate or
inhibit immune cells

422
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,370
by binding to receptors
on immune cell surfaces.

423
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,350
They control how immune cells
move throughout the body.

424
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,370
They can help immune cells
exit the blood and home

425
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,260
to sites of inflammation
or infection in tissues,

426
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,800
helping your immune system
locate and eradicate disease

427
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,330
throughout the body.

428
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,068
Glycans play important
roles in innate immunity,

429
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,610
where they help your
immune system do

430
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,600
one of its most important jobs,
which is to distinguish self

431
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,220
and non-self, telling
the difference

432
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,560
between host and pathogen.

433
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,030
And they can further influence
adaptive immune responses,

434
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,010
for example, by
helping determine

435
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,340
whether an antibody will
elicit a pro-inflammatory

436
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,460
or an anti-inflammatory
immune program.

437
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,170
Despite all of these
examples, however,

438
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,070
of how glycans play important
roles in the immune system,

439
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,150
we have lacked the
tools to comprehensively

440
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,500
study this biology and to
target glycans therapeutically.

441
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,610
And these are the
gaps that my lab,

442
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,170
which opened here at MIT about
a year ago, seek to address.

443
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,010
We are building
platform technologies

444
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,490
to help us fully understand
how glycans regulate

445
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,710
immune responses,
and to translate

446
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,960
these biological
insights into the design

447
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,840
of new kinds of immunotherapy.

448
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,640
I want to share
an example of how

449
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,370
we've been able to target
glycans for cancer immunotherapy

450
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:28,460
that builds upon recent
fundamental and translational

451
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,280
advances in the field.

452
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,780
In order to grow and
spread throughout the body,

453
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,580
cancer cells upregulate
molecules on their cell surfaces

454
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,670
that bind to inhibitory
receptors on immune cells.

455
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,300
By engaging these so-called
immune checkpoints,

456
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,930
the cancer cells can put the
brakes on the immune response,

457
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,930
allowing them to evade
normal immune surveillance.

458
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,590
However, if you block
these immune checkpoints

459
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,000
with something like a
monoclonal antibody,

460
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,010
we can-- there's the potential
to reprogram and reactivate

461
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,100
the immune system to sense
and respond to cancer.

462
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,620
These checkpoint
blockade immunotherapies

463
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,330
were tested initially
in metastatic melanoma,

464
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,940
an incredibly aggressive
form of cancer.

465
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,240
And in one of these
trials, patients

466
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,080
who received a combination of
therapies targeting the PD1

467
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,540
and CTLA 4 immune
checkpoints, about 30% of them

468
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,300
mounted a robust immune
response to their cancer

469
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,130
that basically stopped
the disease in its tracks.

470
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,310
These patients diseases
had not progressed

471
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,410
in over a decade following
the start of treatment.

472
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,650
And in light of the
success in melanoma,

473
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,810
checkpoint blockade
immunotherapies

474
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,730
have now been tested in a
variety of other cancers

475
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,810
and are now approved to treat
about 50% of cancer patients.

476
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,240
However, across all cancer
patients, only about 20%

477
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,470
benefit from these therapies.

478
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,150
And so now the question is, why?

479
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,800
How are cancer cells able
to evade immune surveillance

480
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,610
and resist immunotherapy
in most cancer patients?

481
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,770
And that's where glycans
come back into the story.

482
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,570
It turns out that cancer cells
dramatically alter their cell

483
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,170
surface glycosylation.

484
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,990
This is a hallmark
of cancer that's

485
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,060
been observed in many
different tumor types

486
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,620
and across many different
patient cohorts.

487
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,580
And we now understand that
one of the reasons that cancer

488
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,200
cells remodel their
surfaces in this way

489
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,800
is to engage a class
of inhibitory receptors

490
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,300
on immune cells that
are called lectins.

491
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,740
So when lectins bind to these
glycans on cancer cell surfaces,

492
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,220
they trigger inhibitory
signaling pathways

493
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,330
that shut down immune responses
through the exact same mechanism

494
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,300
that occurs when the established
immune checkpoint receptor, PD1,

495
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,720
binds to its ligand, PL1.

496
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,320
And while we have a litany of
drugs that target the PD1/ PDL1

497
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,800
immune checkpoint, we have no
approved therapies to target

498
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,430
these glyco immune checkpoints.

499
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,010
We recently developed
a new kind of molecule

500
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,050
that makes it possible
to target glycans

501
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,360
for cancer immunotherapy.

502
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,360
These molecules we're calling
antibody lectin chimeras

503
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,920
or AbLecs, and
they're bispecific.

504
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,150
One half of the molecule
is an antibody domain

505
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,470
that can target specific
cells in the body,

506
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,420
for example, cancer cells.

507
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,290
The other half of
the molecule is

508
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,280
what we call a decoy receptor.

509
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,910
It's the binding domain
from the lectin receptor

510
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,000
we want to target, which
serves to bind and block

511
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,520
the same kinds of glycans
that would otherwise

512
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,690
inhibit immune responses.

513
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,030
And so our hypothesis
was that with AbLecs,

514
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,120
we could block these
glyco immune checkpoints

515
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,140
and elicit more potent
anti-cancer immune responses.

516
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,150
We tested these
therapies initially

517
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,930
in vitro with primary human
immune cells like macrophages

518
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,140
and NK cells.

519
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,890
These are two different
kinds of innate immune cells

520
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,590
that we could imagine activating
with our AbLec therapy.

521
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,790
And you can see that for both
macrophages and NK cells,

522
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,810
treatment with our AbLecs
elicited more potent cancer

523
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,160
cell killing compared to a
monoclonal antibody control.

524
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,460
And in vivo, in a humanized
model of metastatic cancer,

525
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,590
we observed that animals treated
with our AbLec immunotherapy

526
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,690
exhibited reduced tumor burden
and compared to animals treated

527
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,880
with the control molecule.

528
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,260
With this proof of concept, we
launched a new biotechnology

529
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,300
startup called Velora
Therapeutics that aims

530
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,940
to bring AbLecs to patients.

531
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,310
The exciting thing about
the AbLecs platform

532
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,460
is that it's modular.

533
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,150
You can imagine mixing and
matching different antibody

534
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,730
and lectin domains
to enable a variety

535
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,440
of different therapeutic
mechanisms of action.

536
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,010
And Velora is leveraging
this modularity

537
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,720
to develop therapies--

538
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,430
AbLec immunotherapies
for indications

539
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,800
in oncology and immunology.

540
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,500
But this is just the beginning.

541
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,470
Glycans play pivotal
roles in the immune system

542
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,960
and are really attractive
therapeutic targets.

543
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
My group is developing
the platform technologies

544
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,540
we'll need to explore this
emerging biological frontier

545
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,120
and enable both fundamental
and translational advances.

546
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,720
So with that, I'd like
to thank my lab who

547
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,530
made this work possible.

548
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,800
I look forward to
taking your questions,

549
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,890
and I'd like to invite our next
speaker, Professor Hari Wong,

550
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,910
to the stage.

551
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,248
[APPLAUSE]

552
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:28,560

553
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,270
It's great to be here.

554
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,610
I want to talk to you
a little bit about some

555
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,220
of the complexities
that exist in studying

556
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,140
the immune response,
why they exist,

557
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,410
and how our group has been
developing technologies

558
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,190
and implementing technologies
to try to overcome them.

559
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,920
We spend a lot of time
thinking about how

560
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,080
the immune system operates
in its native environment.

561
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,190
So not in a dish, not in
blood, but actually where it

562
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,230
needs to function in tissues.

563
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,010
And the reason we do this
is at least threefold.

564
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,060
One is that the immune
system is a system of cells.

565
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,900
It's not one cell.

566
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,250
It's multiple cells.

567
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:12,210
And these cells typically form
multicellular units of control.

568
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,270
They assemble in
space and in time

569
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,810
into intricate structures that
do things that no one cell

570
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,300
type can do on its own.

571
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,860
You get emergent dynamics,
emergent functions,

572
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,330
and it's very hard to
reconstruct these units

573
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,050
in vitro settings.

574
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,520
The second point
I want to make is

575
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,880
that the immune cells
within these units

576
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,860
are communicating dynamically.

577
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,930
They're engaged in physical
interactions with one another.

578
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,640
They secrete molecules
over short distances

579
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,710
and over long distances.

580
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:52,100
And the communication is always
evolving over time and in space.

581
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,600
And lastly, the
point I want to make

582
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,480
is that the most interesting
aspects of the immune response,

583
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,170
at least in my mind,
both in physiological and

584
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,260
pathophysiological
settings, are not mediated

585
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,670
by the bulk of the cells.

586
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:12,000
They're typically mediated
by rare outlier cells

587
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,930
on the ends of the distribution.

588
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm not sure how to go back.

589
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,575
There we go.

590
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:22,020

591
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,790
So let me walk you
through technologies

592
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,373
that my lab has been
developing to try

593
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:28,380
to overcome each and every
one of these three challenges.

594
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,870
We typically take an
imaging-based approach

595
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,203
to really be able
to resolve and study

596
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:34,870
these cells in their
native environment.

597
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,620
So what you're looking
at here on the left

598
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,200
is a lymph node that lies
downstream of the kidney.

599
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,180
I want to direct your attention
to this inset over here.

600
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,450
We've developed multiplexed
imaging technologies

601
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,630
using antibodies that now
allow us to visualize anywhere

602
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:54,000
between 20 and 60 proteins
directly in tissues where

603
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,390
the immune response
is occurring.

604
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,930
What you're looking at
here on the zoomed in inset

605
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,820
is a multicellular unit that's
controlling T cell responses.

606
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,070
You don't have to worry about
what all the colors are.

607
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,690
The point I want to make is that
there are innate immune cells

608
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,110
here, like Stephanie introduced
earlier, that are initializing

609
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,470
T cell responses.

610
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,360
There are these
green cells here.

611
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,683
These are regulatory T cells.

612
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:16,600
There's not one of them,
there's many of them.

613
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,210
These are cells that are trying
to dampen the immune response.

614
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,540
And there are conventional
CD4 and CD8 T cells here.

615
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,990
These are cells that
are trying to promote

616
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,490
inflammation and promote
the immune response.

617
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,277
And if you try to study any
one of these cell types alone,

618
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:32,110
you can't really figure
out what's going on.

619
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,110
It is the integrated
behavior of all three

620
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,580
of these cell types
in space and in time

621
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,990
that is predictive of how the
immune response will behave.

622
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,740
So we can address this.

623
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,600
We can identify the
units of control.

624
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,640
We can identify the
relevant cellular players.

625
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,970
What about the
communication aspect?

626
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,200
Well, we've now developed
ways to preserve tissues

627
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,300
in a manner that
allows us to estimate

628
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,740
length scales of
communications between cells.

629
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,180
Let me walk you
through what I mean.

630
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,540
Here, outlined in white,
these are two endogenously

631
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,680
activated conventional T cells.

632
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,910
They are producing a
molecule called IL2.

633
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,770
This is a cytokine
that's shown in red.

634
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,380
This cytokine will get
secreted and diffused in space.

635
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,000
These surrounding
cells in magenta,

636
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,430
these are regulatory T cells.

637
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,930
Like I said earlier,
these are cells

638
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,890
that try to dampen
the immune response.

639
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,690
And in green, we're reading out
signaling downstream of the IL2

640
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,940
receptor by measuring the
phosphorylation of STAT5,

641
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,240
a transcription factor.

642
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,080
If we look to the right, what I
want you to take away from this

643
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,170
is that there is a
gradient of green,

644
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,060
and it's largely in the
regulatory cells here.

645
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,100
And by reading
out this gradient,

646
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,480
we can infer how
far the cytokine

647
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,710
must be diffusing in space.

648
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,560
And this is important
because cells

649
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,760
that are positioned here
close to the producing cells

650
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,800
are going to see a very
different concentration

651
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,430
of this cytokine than cells that
are positioned way back here.

652
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,770
And therefore, cells that
are positioned closest

653
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,430
to the producing cells are
going to adopt a different fate

654
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,550
than cells that are
positioned way back here.

655
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,050
So this is a source
of variation,

656
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,770
how the immune system generates
heterogeneity in its responses

657
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,190
during a dynamic
immune response.

658
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,360
This is all well and
good, but it's fixed.

659
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,420
These are static images, and
the immune system is not static.

660
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,050
It's dynamic.

661
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,420
As I told you earlier,
communication is dynamic.

662
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,020
So we've also invested in
technologies that allow us

663
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,800
to peer inside of living
organisms-- this is a mouse--

664
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,450
and actually watch the
immune system in real time.

665
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,270
What we've done here
is a small surgery

666
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,250
in a mouse under anesthetic.

667
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,880
And we're looking
behind the knee.

668
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
It's the popliteal lymph node.

669
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,778
And we're peering in and we're
watching the immune response

670
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:43,003
in real time.

671
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,920
It doesn't really matter
what's going on here.

672
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,510
But the cells in magenta, these
are the regulatory T cells

673
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,350
that are dampening
the immune response.

674
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,550
They're not fixed.

675
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,770
They're zipping all over
the place in real time.

676
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,150
And the cells in magenta,
these are conventional cells--

677
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,650
conventional T cells
that are trying

678
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,570
to initiate an immune response.

679
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,040
So there's a
complex choreography

680
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,855
that's always going on in our
bodies at any moment in time.

681
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:08,120

682
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,530
Now, what about the
last point I raised,

683
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,620
how can we identify
the rare cells

684
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,350
that are doing the most
interesting biology?

685
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,000
The technologies I showed
you so far are fantastic,

686
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,970
but they're limited in the depth
of tissue that we can image.

687
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,783
We can't look at enough
volume with those methods.

688
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,450
So we have to take a
different approach.

689
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,170
And the approach we use is
an optical clearing method

690
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,570
that allows us to treat
our organs of interest

691
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,660
with a chemical concoction
that homogenizes

692
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,113
its refractive index.

693
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:39,530
What that means, practically,
is that it turns our tissues

694
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,820
from completely opaque
to clear and transparent.

695
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,920
And from a microscopy
perspective,

696
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,890
this allows us to now
image the entire organ

697
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,100
in three dimensional space
without any light scattering.

698
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,580
Here's an example of that.

699
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,760
This is a mouse uterus
that's been cleared.

700
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,820
And we're going to
zoom in the cyan,

701
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,910
these are the uterine glands.

702
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,720
And what we can find are
these rare clusters of T cells

703
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,380
here in magenta that are
wrapped around the glands doing

704
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,480
some type of important function.

705
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,550
That's very distinct from
the rest of the cells

706
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,610
in the entire organ.

707
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,010
These are the rare cells in
the tail of the distribution,

708
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,870
and they're
functioning as a unit.

709
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,389
But again, it's very different
behavior than the rest--

710
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:23,975
the bulk of the distribution.

711
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:25,600
So I've shown you
the technologies that

712
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,505
allow us to overcome
the challenges,

713
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:29,380
But, it's not good enough
for us to just take

714
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,710
pretty pictures and movies.

715
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,663
We need to combine these
experimental methods

716
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,080
with computational
approaches that

717
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,239
allow us to extract as
much useful information

718
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,380
from our movies and
images as possible.

719
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,010
So for that, we've invested in
computational algorithms that

720
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,600
allow us to define the
boundaries of individual cells

721
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,710
and reconstruct our
organs of interest

722
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,405
with all of their features
and protein expressions.

723
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:54,378

724
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:55,670
We can do this in the computer.

725
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,250
So what you're
looking at here is

726
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,750
a computational
reconstruction of a lymph node

727
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,400
where every dot represents
an individual cell.

728
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,957
And we can analyze
specific regions

729
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:06,290
of space, which is important
because different reactions

730
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,420
occur in different places.

731
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,610
We can use these
measurements to then conduct

732
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,930
a variety of quantitative types
of analyses, similar to what

733
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,440
you would do in data science.

734
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,550
We can take these
measurements and parameterize

735
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,270
mechanistic models using
systems of equations

736
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,180
to simulate how different
aspects of the immune response

737
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,000
will proceed.

738
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,680
We can make predictions.

739
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,670
And then, we can go back
in to model organisms

740
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,910
and test those predictions
using genetic or environmental

741
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,030
manipulations.

742
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,160
And through these
types of technologies,

743
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,368
I think, this is how we'll
get a better understanding

744
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:43,730
of fundamental operations of the
immune system and understanding

745
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,650
how different
therapeutics actually

746
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,540
work in their sites of action--

747
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,450
in their tissue sites
of action, that is.

748
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,910
So with that, thank you,
and I'm pleased to introduce

749
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,710
our next speaker,
Professor Michael Birnbaum.

750
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,093
[APPLAUSE]

751
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:04,000

752
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,390
All right, thanks to Hari, and
it's good to see you all today.

753
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,400
So in my lab, we want to know--

754
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,410
we want to be able to
see what T cells see.

755
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,240
So to give you a
graphic I pulled

756
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,310
from a recent review, when a T
cell is looking for cells that

757
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,110
are infected or otherwise
transformed by cancer,

758
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,840
the way that this
actually works is

759
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,890
that every T cell has its own
protein sensor called a T cell

760
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,250
receptor, which
takes recognition

761
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,300
of what we call an HLA,
or an MHC molecule, which

762
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,020
presents a short peptide.

763
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,210
And these MHC peptide
complexes present

764
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,270
a census in terms of what the
cell is expressing at any time.

765
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,550
So when a cell is expressing
just the normal proteins that

766
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,150
make a hepatocyte a hepatocyte
or a lung cell a lung cell,

767
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,840
then T cells leave the cell
to go about its business.

768
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,030
When a cell is
otherwise altered,

769
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,010
so whether it has an
intracellular bacteria infected

770
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,670
by a virus or transformed in
terms of becoming a cancer,

771
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,730
then the peptides are
different and the T cell

772
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,640
is able to recognize it
through the T cell receptor

773
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,020
and then kill the cell,
among other immune functions.

774
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,780
So for me, one of the
fascinating things about this

775
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,590
is that this actually serves as
numerically an interesting thing

776
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,620
to think about.

777
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,070
So in each one of
us, and my math

778
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,440
could be off by a factor
of 10 in any direction,

779
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,580
but there's roughly, say, around
50 to 100 million unique T cell

780
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,400
specificities floating
around in each one of you

781
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,770
at any given time
out of a possible 10

782
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:49,500
to the 15 possibilities for T
cells for just combinatorially

783
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,620
for the receptor.

784
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,680
And these are recognizing
these peptide MHC complexes

785
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,100
where in terms of what you
theoretically could have in you,

786
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,270
again, math is back
of the envelope,

787
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,170
it's something around a
trillion possibilities in terms

788
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,970
of peptide and MHC
combinations in any one of us.

789
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,833
They're not all present
at any given time,

790
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,500
but there's no way
for the immune system

791
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,240
to know which one of these you
may encounter during your life

792
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,080
and which ones are
purely theoretical.

793
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,060
This is all happening
in a system that

794
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,710
has to be incredibly sensitive--
because if you're infected,

795
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,335
you have to be able to recognize
it-- at what we would consider

796
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:23,580
incredibly low affinities.

797
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,410
So interactions that occur
at body temperature that

798
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,250
lasts for maybe about a second.

799
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,360
And if you do the bookkeeping,
it turns out that each one

800
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,820
of these T cell specificities
would have to be able

801
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,150
to recognize on the order of
100,000 different antigens

802
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,640
in order for the
books to balance here.

803
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,130
Otherwise, you could
have, on one hand,

804
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,790
for example, a pathogen, which
is able to completely evade

805
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,200
detection.

806
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,658
And somehow, on
the other hand, you

807
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:51,117
have to be able to
do this in a way

808
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:52,760
where you still have
enough specificity

809
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,100
that the recognition of a
virus doesn't inadvertently

810
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,840
lead to the recognition of any
of your own healthy tissues.

811
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,750
So your immune system
is doing this every day,

812
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:08,080
all day, for each of us, very
nearly perfectly all the time.

813
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,680
And I really want to know
how this is able to work,

814
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,560
and able to work in a way
that is so specific in order

815
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,860
to allow this to happen.

816
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,670
Understanding this
specificity is going

817
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,920
to help us understand biology.

818
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,920
It's going to help us create a
next generation of therapeutics.

819
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,550
And increasingly, especially
with the explosion

820
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,400
of progress in AI, the
ability to make better

821
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,970
computational tools.

822
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,798
So for all of this, though,
what we remain limited in

823
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:36,340
is the number of
examples which we've

824
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,270
been able to really observe.

825
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,940
So this is a field,
understanding

826
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,830
how T cell receptors
recognize peptidomimetics

827
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:48,020
that has really been in progress
as long as I've been alive.

828
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,100
But we've studied, really,
relatively small numbers

829
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,820
of examples.

830
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,805
So in order to be
able to make progress,

831
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:54,930
we're going to be able to--

832
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,750
need to be able to
look at much more data.

833
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,380
So in my lab, we want to
develop better tools in order

834
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,860
to be able to understand this.

835
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,160
And so we think quite
broadly about how to do this.

836
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,502
We use a variety of approaches.

837
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:09,460
I want to tell you just
for a couple of minutes

838
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,440
about one of them that
we've done in our lab.

839
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,170
And what we've actually done is
repurposed a common laboratory

840
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,730
tool, which itself is
a repurposed virus.

841
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,980
So we work in our lab
with lentiviruses,

842
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,740
which is a heavily
engineered for laboratory use

843
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,880
safe version of a virus
that started as HIV,

844
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,850
of all things, where we
re-engineered it to say, OK,

845
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,658
what if we take these
lentiviruses, which are commonly

846
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:38,700
engineered to infect any
cell that you might want

847
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,290
into in the lab, and have them
infect only T cells by putting

848
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,730
peptide-MHC molecules
on their surface?

849
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,790
So in this way, you
create a virus that

850
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,120
is specific for a given T cell.

851
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,340
And lentiviruses are
quite unique because what

852
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,470
they are able to do as
part of their life cycle

853
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,810
is leave a permanent
record of their infection

854
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,770
into a cell's genome by
incorporating the viral genome

855
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,400
into the host genome.

856
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,990
So our thought was, if we put
a peptide-MHC on the virus,

857
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,680
we could have a system where
we have infection mediated

858
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,620
by the molecule on the
outside with a record kept

859
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,145
by the molecule on the inside.

860
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:16,520
And if we're able to build
large collections or libraries

861
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,760
of these as a tool, which
is common in biotechnology,

862
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,410
we could use this as a recorder
of this peptide-MHC T cell

863
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,240
receptor interaction.

864
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,757
So we set about doing
this a few years ago.

865
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:30,840
And we were able to show
that this actually works.

866
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,920
So you could create a
virus with a peptide MHC.

867
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,100
If that virus
encounters any cell that

868
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,180
doesn't have the right
T cell specificity,

869
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,362
even one that's close
but not exactly right,

870
00:41:41,362 --> 00:41:43,820
you see little to no infection,
so this is a virus encoding

871
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,910
cells to turn green--

872
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,460
very few green.

873
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,060
Where if you have a virus
that does have that match,

874
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,390
you get robust
infection of cells.

875
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,760
So we created a
tool, a method which

876
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,730
we call RAPTR, Receptor
Antigen Pairing by Targeted

877
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,370
Retroviruses, we were
able to create libraries

878
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,460
of these viruses, mix
them with T cells,

879
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,510
and then, allow for the
mixtures to only infect

880
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,320
the right combination.

881
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,130
So the mixture of viruses only
infecting the correct T cell.

882
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,750
We're able to then isolate them
and use single cell sequencing

883
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,340
in order to get
the information out

884
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,560
of what the T cell receptor
is and what the antigen

885
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,398
is on a many versus many basis.

886
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:23,190
So something that we
are trying to approach

887
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,710
the scales of how the immune
system itself would work.

888
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,210
And we were able to show
that this is able to work.

889
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,030
That you're able
to identify, even

890
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,120
in a complex mixture of viruses
with different peptides,

891
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,240
once you sequenced the viruses
that are able to infect,

892
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,950
you're able to get the
right answer back out.

893
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,840
So this is a tool we're
very excited about.

894
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,330
But a little
belatedly, we realized

895
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,730
that if you're able to
infect a cell in order

896
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,700
to deliver a genetic
cargo for something

897
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,793
like a fluorescent
protein or a barcode,

898
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:50,210
that you should
also be able to do

899
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,460
it to deliver some type of
therapeutic cargo as well.

900
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,520
And so we're in the process
of exploring this, too.

901
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,430
And the way that we're
thinking about this

902
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,110
is in terms of different
types of cell therapies.

903
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,920
So it turns out that
your immune system

904
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,070
can mount a defense against
tumors all on its own.

905
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,470
We call these tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes.

906
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,560
This is something that often
is not effective on its own,

907
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,102
but is something
where just recently,

908
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:16,602
in the past few
months, there's been

909
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:19,430
a clinically-approved therapy
where these cells are taken out

910
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,647
of the tumor, grown
back up, and reinfused.

911
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:24,230
So this is great because it's
recognizing exactly what happens

912
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,350
to be in your tumor.

913
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,900
But is torturously
complex to make.

914
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,860
Correspondingly, we're
able to engineer T cells

915
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,930
through something called
a CAR-T therapy where

916
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,300
we're able to point T cells
in the right direction.

917
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,730
But this is also complex
to make and only works

918
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,240
for certain cancers.

919
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,060
So what we've done in our lab
is created the same viral system

920
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,860
where now, instead of
delivering a barcode,

921
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,360
we're able to deliver
therapeutic cargoes to the T

922
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:48,860
cells.

923
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,330
So we're able to, even in
vivo, infuse a virus which

924
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,230
is able to find
the right T cell,

925
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,820
reprogram it genetically to
become more immuno activated

926
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,180
in one way or the other, and
then able to extend lifespan

927
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:01,970
in mice.

928
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,990
So we're in the process
of exploring both

929
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,500
of these aspects in our lab.

930
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,520
And this is where the
collaborative and big picture

931
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,570
thinking of MIT
really comes in handy.

932
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,040
So on one hand, we
are a part of and I'm

933
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,530
the leader of a team funded
through a mechanism called

934
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,330
a Cancer Grand
Challenge in order

935
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,630
to truly try to
generalize the predictions

936
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,120
of peptide-MHC molecules
and T cell receptors

937
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,570
to design these receptors.

938
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,880
So this is a team of
immunologists, clinicians,

939
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,850
engineers all working together.

940
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,760
So several of which
at MIT, but also

941
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,010
for individuals around
the world, to really try

942
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,540
to address one of these
large problems in immunology,

943
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,280
how can we make
these predictions?

944
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,380
And then, we're also working
to take our targeted viruses

945
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,630
and turned them into a
drug in a company called

946
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,450
Colonial Therapeutics where
we were able to show really

947
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,030
promising data that's
been talked about

948
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,660
at meetings, both in
terms of mice and monkeys,

949
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,160
with the hopes of starting a
clinical trial in the next year

950
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,830
or so.

951
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,270
So thanks for your attention.

952
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,700
I believe we're moving
to a Q&A session.

953
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:06,240
[APPLAUSE]

954
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,560
Please join me in thanking
the speakers again,

955
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,628
and I would like to invite
all the speakers on stage.

956
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:17,029
[APPLAUSE]

957
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:22,410

958
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,360
And this will be
an open Q&A panel.

959
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,690
So if you have questions,
please raise your hand

960
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,200
and we will call on you.

961
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,170
But I would like to
start off this panel

962
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:36,480
by getting each one of your
takes on why immunology at MIT

963
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,410
is different to normal
immunology departments that

964
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,410
are typically housed
in medical schools

965
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:45,600
and are very embedded
into clinical practice.

966
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,760
Facundo.

967
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,430
Well, MIT is a unique in
ecological environment where

968
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,940
you get direct access to
engineering and computation that

969
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,100
doesn't occur, generally, in a
normal immunology department.

970
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,430
So I always train
in institutions

971
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,550
that they were kind of having a
large breadth of collaboration.

972
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,580
And particularly
for me, I can talk,

973
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,800
it's rather a unique opportunity
to be close people to do things

974
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,150
that I am not an expert on.

975
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,600
Well, as Harry mentioned,
the immune system

976
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,750
is a stochastic dynamical
system with many participating

977
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:31,580
components in a fluctuating
environment that work together

978
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,220
to ultimately give you
a coherent response,

979
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,060
either to pathogens
or to cancer,

980
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,040
or sometimes, when it's
[INAUDIBLE] regulated

981
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,730
to yourself.

982
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,640
And if we have to
understand that,

983
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,060
we have to bring together
tools from basic biology,

984
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:56,530
from engineering, computation,
and systems design

985
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,270
in order to really
make that happen.

986
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:03,705
And then, translate that
into therapies and vaccines,

987
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:05,140
et cetera.

988
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,730
And MIT has all
these components,

989
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,690
from basic biology to
systems engineering.

990
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,520
And it's an inherently
collaborative place

991
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,300
and a collegial place.

992
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,900
And so that brings all of
these together in a mix

993
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,540
that I really have not
seen in other places.

994
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,360
And I'm the old man
here, so I can tell you

995
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,415
I've seen more places.

996
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:29,110

997
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:34,360
I think immunology is a field
that really needs technology.

998
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,850
We've seen huge advances
in our understanding

999
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,620
of immunobiology through the
advent of genetics, machine

1000
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,170
learning, computational
approaches.

1001
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,180
And these are things that
MIT is really good at.

1002
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,820
And especially in
my field, we really

1003
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,367
need technology development
to enable new discoveries.

1004
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,200
So I think that's a
unique feature of doing.

1005
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,150
Immunology immunology at MIT.

1006
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,720
We're at the cutting
edge of technology

1007
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,750
that we can apply to
our biological problems.

1008
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,170
I don't have too much to add
we haven't already heard.

1009
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,930
I'll just say, I don't know if
my lab could operate in the way

1010
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,180
it does at many other
places in the world..

1011
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,940
Because we need to
be able to bridge

1012
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:16,310
experimental immunologists with
computationalists and hybrids

1013
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,240
that can do both,
and having access

1014
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,450
to those types of trainees.

1015
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,160
That's very uncommon that want
to do all three of those things

1016
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,250
at most other institutions.

1017
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,130
So this, I think, is especially
helpful for immunology

1018
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,060
because it seems to be a
property of MIT in general.

1019
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,480
It's pretty unique to combine
fearlessness and rigor

1020
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,340
in a combination
that actually works.

1021
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,057
Like the ability to try
what might seem like it just

1022
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:45,890
definitely isn't going
to work, or something

1023
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,670
that might seem a
little bit crazy.

1024
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:51,140
But do it in a way where
substance is never lost.

1025
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,610
Where you make
sure that we really

1026
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,410
are going to do this
to make the impact,

1027
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,210
not just to make the
flash in the pan.

1028
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,080
And I think that, in immunology,
everything my colleague

1029
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,350
said about technology
and connections

1030
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,130
with each other, all
of that's important.

1031
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:10,040
But I think that everybody
from the sophomores and juniors

1032
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,990
in my lab who have
started projects

1033
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,390
through to the graduate
students, the postdocs,

1034
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,480
and my faculty colleagues
to combine fearlessness

1035
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,060
and rigor in one setting
is a special thing.

1036
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,740
Question over here.

1037
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,160
OK, I have two questions.

1038
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,890
You will get them.

1039
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,130
I was a cheerleader.

1040
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,250
I can do this.

1041
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,370
Two questions.

1042
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,650
The first, is in
the earlier session

1043
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,650
they spoke about how difficult
it was to move from a mouse

1044
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,100
model to a human model.

1045
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,080
And I'm wondering if that is
less difficult than the work

1046
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,330
that you do, because it
appears you're translating it

1047
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,780
faster and more readily?

1048
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,830
So that's question one.

1049
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,470
Question two is, I think, for
professors Wong and Birnbaum is

1050
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,690
my understanding is
that solid tumors are

1051
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,090
harder to treat these days.

1052
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,630
And is your work directed
towards solid tumor treatment?

1053
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,970
So that's my question.

1054
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,310
OK, maybe Facundo, you can
start on the first question.

1055
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,750
Those are excellent questions.

1056
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,120
And there is no perfect model.

1057
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,410
And every model helps
to address a problem.

1058
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,930
A human clinical trial
will take tens of millions

1059
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,280
of dollars and
several years to plan.

1060
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,530
What we can take the
advantage is in the mouse,

1061
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,050
for example, is
to iterate things

1062
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,440
extremely, extremely fast.

1063
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,090
And then, narrow them down
to be then tested in humans.

1064
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,310
And the technologies that
we do in the lab that

1065
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:33,020
is trying to make this
mouse more similar to humans

1066
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:37,140
are at the tip of this because
with all the predictions,

1067
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,430
and there is an experiment
ongoing there, all the mouse

1068
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,530
experiments that we and
many others have done,

1069
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:46,220
they have now done the
human experiment and show

1070
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,810
that the predictions
were absolutely right.

1071
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,040
So again.

1072
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,150
There is no perfect model.

1073
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,700
We will not know-- everything
will not work the same,

1074
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,280
but at least at a very
diminished cost and time,

1075
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,920
we can operate in the
mouse as a credible model.

1076
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,610
And I think maybe
to add specifically

1077
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:04,430
because I was in the session.

1078
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,620
The immune system,
I think, translates

1079
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:11,090
better because we're looking
at systematic changes and not

1080
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,970
a single molecule
in a pathway that

1081
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,510
has to be conserved
between mouse and human.

1082
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,640
And for the second
question, Michael,.

1083
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,250
Sorry.

1084
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,310
So for the second question,
in terms of translation,

1085
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,680
it's a little bit of both.

1086
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,030
So the slide I showed
towards the end

1087
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,690
is in models of melanoma.

1088
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,360
And so we're interested--

1089
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,360
which is a place where these
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes

1090
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,970
has been clinically approved
could stand to be improved.

1091
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,120
And so we really--

1092
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,550
even for mouse
versus human, it's

1093
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,030
really every tool for a job.

1094
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,530
So some of the questions we
ask in terms of solid tumors

1095
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,550
where immunotherapy
has been successful,

1096
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,880
some were working in
things like glioblastoma

1097
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,197
where progress or solid
tumors has been slower.

1098
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:00,280
Some of it's in liquid
tumors because that's where

1099
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,583
some of the clinical data is.

1100
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,250
And so we do our best
to match depending

1101
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,800
on what we're working on.

1102
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,200
Question over here
and then back there.

1103
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,670
Thank you.

1104
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,380
Thank you for the whole panel.

1105
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,333
Fantastic talk.

1106
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:13,750
So I have two
questions, actually,

1107
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,430
one for the whole panel.

1108
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,840
What do you think
about mRNA technology?

1109
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,028
What are the advantages
you see currently,

1110
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:21,820
or do you see any
limitations for your work

1111
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,300
you are doing in immunology for
vaccines or maybe therapeutics?

1112
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,640
Second question is for Jessica.

1113
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,810
Love the talk.

1114
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,310
Antibody lectins.

1115
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,910
Curious to see how
you are going to apply

1116
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,560
this technology from oncology
to autoimmune diseases.

1117
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,250
Thank you.

1118
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:40,740

1119
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,690
So I'll start with the
question directed at me.

1120
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,210
Thanks for that.

1121
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,320
Yeah, so these applications
and indications

1122
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,540
in autoimmunity and immunology
that we are going after.

1123
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,810
In these indications,
there's biological rationale

1124
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:01,800
for why you might want to target
a glyco immune checkpoint.

1125
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,580
So for example, in
autoimmunity, while in cancer we

1126
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,210
block glyco immune checkpoints
to potentiate immune responses,

1127
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,770
in the context of
autoimmunity, you

1128
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,740
could imagine engaging those
same immune checkpoints

1129
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,080
to elicit tolerance
in the same way

1130
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,040
that tumors tolerize the
immune system to themselves.

1131
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,830
In the setting of
fibrosis, there's

1132
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,530
a glyco immune checkpoint
that allows fibrosis

1133
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,090
to continue unchecked that we
are thinking about targeting

1134
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,430
to help slow that process down.

1135
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,010
But all of this builds
upon fundamental biology,

1136
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,420
fundamental life science
research that has shed light

1137
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,986
on these biological mechanisms.

1138
00:53:39,986 --> 00:53:43,610

1139
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,320
Let's move over there.

1140
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,030
Good afternoon, everyone.

1141
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,330
Stepping back a little
bit, I was impressed with--

1142
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,100
across a number of
your presentations

1143
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,430
about just how dynamic
the immune system is.

1144
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:59,030
Just the scale, the quantities
that you're dealing with

1145
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,510
are just astronomical.

1146
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:03,020
And then, on top of
it, you have people.

1147
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,660
And so I was also impressed
by the slide showing

1148
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:11,120
if you could give seven doses
days with increasing amounts

1149
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,400
and you get a really tremendous
response, but impractical.

1150
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,970
And I really want to target or
push on that in practicality.

1151
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,390
I work with a state
agency that really fights

1152
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,450
infectious disease,
and I want to push back

1153
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,780
on that in practicality.

1154
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,650
What can we do to make
that practical or suggest?

1155
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,490
That's it.

1156
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,420
No, I'm happy to address that.

1157
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,520
I mentioned that a bit too
quickly in a brief talk

1158
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,130
like this.

1159
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:42,640
But we have now, in a
very recent publication,

1160
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,530
which I flashed briefly,
our understanding that

1161
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,630
is a practical challenge.

1162
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:52,060
We have now, by understanding
the mechanisms better,

1163
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:57,660
been able to design a system
which has only two shots, which

1164
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,170
takes it much closer to
practicality because two shots

1165
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,950
you can do.

1166
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,540
And so that's now slated
to go to clinical trial.

1167
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,630
The seven shot was already
done, as I showed in humans.

1168
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,390
But that's where we
are going with this

1169
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:15,990
is to do the two shot
regimen because that does

1170
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:19,860
just as well, at least in mice.

1171
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,390
Question over there.

1172
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,020
Thank you for the
exciting talks.

1173
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,940
I'd like to follow-up a little
bit on that question on probably

1174
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,170
a more fundamental question.

1175
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,290
In the seven doses,
I can understand

1176
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:33,200
that you're saying the
subdominant epitopes

1177
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,700
will increase, but
viruses are equally smart.

1178
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,900
I'm just wondering what
if the previous epitope

1179
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,060
starts dominating again
because viruses can mutate?

1180
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,030
You're trying to
decrease one epitope

1181
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,300
and increase the epitope.

1182
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,750
The second question following
up with Harry's talk,

1183
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,870
he can actually now visualize
and quantify the timelines.

1184
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:53,690
Is it possible to--

1185
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,270
I don't know how different
B cell kinetics and T cell

1186
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,870
kinetics are, but is it even
possible to get both of them

1187
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,150
in the same timeline so
that you can actually

1188
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,630
get both arms to
have a good response?

1189
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,330
So your questions are excellent.

1190
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:13,490
And to the part
that I will address

1191
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:17,490
is the following that I
mentioned very briefly

1192
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,290
that we are trying to see
how to leverage this thinking

1193
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,870
into a potential cure for HIV.

1194
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,500
And what we are finding
there is that when

1195
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,230
people have suppressed
virus, but some amount there,

1196
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,980
then this may be--

1197
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,050
this is still very
early days, but it

1198
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,800
may be happening that one by
one, the epitopes get masked

1199
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,980
and then you get more and more
responses and so on and so forth

1200
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,550
while the virus is dormant.

1201
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,710
And so you can then create a
net of antibodies that target

1202
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,240
different regions or epitopes.

1203
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,290
And as a consequence,
when the virus starts

1204
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,900
to come up, the escaping that
net becomes very difficult.

1205
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,960
And so that's the part that--

1206
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,190
I might also slightly
comment on the second part

1207
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,230
of your question.

1208
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,200
In the extended
dose delivery things

1209
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,260
that we have done, in
order to optimize it

1210
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:15,580
to two doses such that it
becomes closer to practicality,

1211
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,880
one of the things
that happens is

1212
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,170
that you sync the
T cell and antibody

1213
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,960
response or B-cell
responses to come more

1214
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,300
within symphony-- asynchrony.

1215
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,190
And if you don't give
the adjuvant also

1216
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,460
in an extended
way, then you won't

1217
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,020
let that to happen
because that's

1218
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,590
how you prime the innate immune
cells, the dendritic cells,

1219
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,950
so that later on they are
more efficient with the T cell

1220
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:44,650
dynamics.

1221
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,700
So there has to be
synchrony between those two

1222
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,150
get the best responses.

1223
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:53,050
Now, how best to image them
and understand them better,

1224
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,710
I'll leave to Harry.

1225
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,500
I'll just say that we and
others have definitely

1226
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,640
shown that you can--

1227
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,900
similar to Arup's
work with B cells.

1228
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:06,450
If you manipulate the dynamics
of what the T cells are seeing,

1229
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,800
you can get better
T cell responses.

1230
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,820
And we know that you can't
get great B cell responses

1231
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,540
without great T cell responses.

1232
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,623
And I think it's just--
we need to put it together

1233
00:58:15,623 --> 00:58:16,380
and actually--

1234
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:21,990
Facundo and Arup should probably
work on something like that.

1235
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,860
I mean, that is an
excellent question.

1236
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:28,770
Antigen or virus is the
fuel of this reaction.

1237
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,790
If that stays for a
long time, this reaction

1238
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,630
goes on for a long time.

1239
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,620
And it goes on from B
and T cell together.

1240
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,100
Arup [INAUDIBLE] show that in
these lymph nodes, when you just

1241
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,260
give one dose, you
don't get antigen there

1242
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,950
for a prolonged period of time.

1243
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:46,490
So answering to your
T cell question, that

1244
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,920
is very important, if
you have the fuel that

1245
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,980
is the antigen there, you
will keep the B cells and T

1246
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,190
cells cooperating for
a prolonged period.

1247
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,830
I made a comment
with regards to--

1248
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:00,270
we know so little
about vaccines.

1249
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,860
All we know is empirical.

1250
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:05,810
And even when we are giving a
prime and a boost in humans,

1251
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,250
that has never been
experimentally proved.

1252
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,490
The time between the
prime and the boost

1253
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:13,500
is something that has been
determined empirically.

1254
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,890
What we are trying to
do and what people do

1255
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:19,210
is really understand the
mechanisms for this in a way

1256
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:22,510
that we may alter this
prime and boost to get

1257
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,960
a more effective response.

1258
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,330
Exactly.

1259
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,420
Perfect.

1260
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,630
I would have one
last question I'm

1261
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,010
going to ask you guys
to answer really,

1262
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,190
really quickly in
the interest of time

1263
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,610
is, what is the next
big frontier each of you

1264
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,400
want to tackle?

1265
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,500
I'm going to start with
Michael for fairness.

1266
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,510
[LAUGHTER]

1267
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:49,575
It's going to be the
integration with AI.

1268
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:54,050

1269
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,450
Can you elaborate a little bit?

1270
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,100
Yeah.

1271
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,680
Stephanie said quick, and
there's a timer counting down.

1272
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,588
We can mingle after [INAUDIBLE].

1273
01:00:01,588 --> 01:00:04,910

1274
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,882
So in my world, it's being able
to make general predictions

1275
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:09,340
and general designs
in the same way

1276
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,580
that you can go to ChatGPT and
make a picture of anything.

1277
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:17,270
Right now, the predictions
are good, but very narrow,

1278
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,180
very, very narrow.

1279
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,660
So would be the equivalent
of having a ChatGPT that's

1280
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,770
really great at making
pictures of ducks,

1281
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,800
and you ask it to make
you a picture of a tiger

1282
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,890
and it gives you a duck.

1283
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,730
So I think that getting to the
point where some of these tools

1284
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,550
are going to be generally useful
is something that we're really

1285
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,100
excited to work towards.

1286
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,208
On my end, I think there are
certainly biological questions

1287
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,250
we're very interested in.

1288
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,010
But on the
technological side, you

1289
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,670
might have noticed that a lot
of the dynamic live imaging

1290
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,160
that we're able to
do, we're limited

1291
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,510
in how many cell types
or readouts of function

1292
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,620
that we can look at.

1293
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,210
And there are
practical limitations.

1294
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,740
So I think something we're
really excited about and trying

1295
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,340
to think about is how can we
visualize many, many more cell

1296
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:05,130
types and their states in
real time in living organisms?

1297
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,870
And that's not a
trivial challenge,

1298
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,760
but we have some ideas.

1299
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,440
We are really focused on
developing technologies that

1300
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:19,090
will allow us to fit
glycans into the broader

1301
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,700
picture of immunology
and immune responses.

1302
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,730
And we need to understand this
biology at a systems level

1303
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:28,450
and how it connects to
all of the other aspects

1304
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,580
of molecular and cellular
immunology that we understand.

1305
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,060
I think those kinds of
fundamental advances

1306
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,360
are going to be necessary
to translate this biology

1307
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,233
and to get to clinical advances.

1308
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:42,640

1309
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,540
In addition to the
things I talked about,

1310
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,490
one of the things that we are
launching in our group right

1311
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:51,250
now is a program to
really understand

1312
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,150
how the innate and adaptive
immune systems are integrated

1313
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:59,770
because very little or much
less is understood about that

1314
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:02,750
than anyone by themselves.

1315
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:06,040
And I believe that will
get us to really start

1316
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,830
understanding
questions like what

1317
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:12,410
determines the memory
of an immune response.

1318
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:16,300
Why is it longer for one
pathogen versus another?

1319
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,400
Why is it longer, perhaps,
in protein antigens

1320
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,810
versus mRNA vaccines?

1321
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:26,670
And so that's one of the
new frontiers that in our--

1322
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,820
new frontiers and our
group is to bring that

1323
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:34,170
into innate and adaptive
immunity together.

1324
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,190
Yeah, I think the connection
between quantitative immunology

1325
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,770
that is very recent, and
then translating that

1326
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,900
into computational
or AI models is

1327
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,610
something that is
extremely exciting

1328
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,110
and is going to be
transformational

1329
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,913
over the next 10 to 20 years.

1330
01:02:47,913 --> 01:02:49,330
I mean, we still
know very little.

1331
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,580
We know we can
generate antigens.

1332
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,940
We know we can
generate antibodies.

1333
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,420
We can produce structures, but
we cannot predict for better

1334
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,240
molecule binding.

1335
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,790
I think that the
next 10 to 20 years

1336
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,250
are going to be transformational
in that respect.

1337
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:02,850
Awesome.

1338
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,120
With that, I would like to thank
the speakers and the panelists,

1339
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,410
and particularly you
for your attention.

1340
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,300
Thank you.

1341
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,150
[APPLAUSE]

1342
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,000
