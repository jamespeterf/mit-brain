00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,359
I think semiconductor technology is

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,440
really the key to address like Global

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,110
challenges for example energy deficiency

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,590
and uh climate

00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,590

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,600
change my research is related to high

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,439
temperature electronics that can be

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,439
operated in a high temperature

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,080
environment so this can um apply to many

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,599
fields that requires extreme conditions

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
one of the main like promising

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,600
semiconductor materials we're using is

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,680
gallan nitrite which is known for its

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,239
ability to endure extreme environment so

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,120
this work is extremely important because

16
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,800
um it applies to a lot of fields um for

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,960
example uh renewable geothermal energy

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,719
is one of them it requires Drilling

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,320
Technologies and sensoring systems that

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,519
often requires temperatures at range

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,640
around like 500° C so um it is very

22
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,760
important to consider the POS abilities

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
of high temperature Gan nitride

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,000
electronic components it's very

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,080
interesting to see how semiconductor

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,159
materials is interconnected or related

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,970
to the advancement in clean energy

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:19,090
fields

29
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,090
