00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello everyone listening and watching.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,519
Uh in this short tutorial I'm going to

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,880
give you a demo of how to use the

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,519
interactive mapping module of the broad

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,000
institute genomics to proteins portal

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,400
which is a discovery platform to link

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,039
genetic screening outputs to protein

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,439
sequence and structure. So this

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,640
particular module has two subm modules

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,039
as you will see after we dive in and

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
this tutorial will focus on the first

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,600
module and then we will have another

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,480
tutorial for the next one. Uh so let's

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,280
uh click on the analyze your data button

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,840
which is the beginning of the workflow.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,559
So when you click there uh the portal

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
will prompt you to sign in using your

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
Gmail address.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,760
So let's do that

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,039
and then it should show you a disclaimer

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,280
and uh as I continue then we can see

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,799
that there are two subm modules within

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,000
this uh analyze your own data or what we

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,000
say as interactive mapping module. So we

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,560
will focus on this particular subm

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,040
module here which is uh how does the

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,320
workflow look like if we start with the

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,360
human gene or protein identifier.

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Clicking here the workflow um will

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,840
launch which involves this four step. Uh

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,040
in step one you will select a gene or a

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,200
protein identifier. From here uh you can

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
search up a gene name of interest or

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
uniro identifier. Here I'm going to

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,200
click on on this example gene name

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
CDKL5.

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,880
Then you will see the faster sequence

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,720
for uh the protein. uh we will proceed

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,840
and then uh we are now at step two which

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,280
is the structure um selection uh part of

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,600
the workflow. Here you can select an

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,479
experimental structure from protein data

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,479
bank or uh alpha fold predicted

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,000
structure by both alpha fold 2 and

45
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,200
three. So in this page uh when you click

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,760
on a structure you will also uh uh be

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,239
able to preview the structure. So in

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,120
alpha fold if I now click here then we

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,760
have a preview of alpha fold structure.

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,280
I'll go back to protein datab bank.

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,360
We'll select back the top structure and

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,120
we'll hit this next annotation step of

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
the workflow.

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,440
in this uh step. Now um if you uh come

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,560
to the annotation view and click on this

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,680
link, you will see the allowable formats

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,879
in which you can input mutations

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,239
or scores that can be numerical values

59
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,319
and features as discrete or categorical

60
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,480
values. And you can map these

61
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,519
annotations to protein sequence and

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,200
structure side by side. So let's close

63
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:05,519
this and uh load some sample annotations

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,239
given here such as mutation and scores

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,400
and then features. One important note

66
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
here is this particular column. The

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
first one residue position is a

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,519
mandatory column because we need this

69
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,879
column to map the annotation on sequence

70
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,720
and structure. And we can also combine

71
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,879
all three types of data that you can map

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,440
um and paste the combined annotation um

73
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,720
in this form. So let's download a

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,000
template uh which involves

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,000
a combined set of annotation.

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:47,519
From here I'm going to copy

77
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,840
these annotations uh and paste here.

78
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,200
But note that you can also upload that

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,080
file as CSV or Excel format and can do

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,799
the same uh execute the same workflow.

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,439
So here now if I submit then it will

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,439
give you this preview of the annotation

83
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,879
table. Um now each cell of this table is

84
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,879
editable. For example, let's try editing

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,400
this um residue position to 13 here. And

86
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,440
now if you hit submit annotation it is

87
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,680
going to show an error that you cannot

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,960
upload a mutation at the position 13 for

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,000
the residue position 12. So we will need

90
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,440
to correct it and we can also change

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,320
this synonymous mutation lysin to lysine

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:41,199
to um lysine to arginine for example. Um

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,400
another important note here is this uh

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,120
category of annotation uh is editable

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,960
from the column header. For example, if

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,919
I now edit this category of data into

97
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,800
mutation, then the portal will detect

98
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,520
that this is an erroriness annotation

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,199
because mutations cannot be uh

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,240
quantitative values. So I will change it

101
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,639
back to score as it should be and we'll

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,360
submit the annotation. But before going

103
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,680
there go um you can also filter your

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,479
columns. For example, if you just upload

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,120
your data file with hundreds of columns

106
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,840
and not all of them are necessary then

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,880
you can uh check off these boxes and you

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,840
can filter the columns and also we show

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,320
a note that more than 30 columns may

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,960
lead to performance issues.

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
So we'll submit the annotation and then

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,440
now the annotations are mapped on the

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,199
sequence space and also on the structure

114
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,160
space. Now from here there are um couple

115
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,320
of options. For example, you can edit

116
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
the color of the annotations here. The

117
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,919
mutations are mapped in red but I can

118
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,440
click on this color wheel and change it

119
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,039
to a different color blue. And you can

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
change these colors for all the

121
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,800
annotations. We can also click on this

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,319
view additional annotations button which

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,600
brings in mutation data variant data

124
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,960
from Nomad cleanvar AGMD. So uh three

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,199
different variant databases and also it

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,919
brings in a suite of protein sequence

127
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,919
and structural features that we have

128
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,639
available in the genomics to proteins

129
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,520
portal but in the resource module. So

130
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,039
for example um for this particular gene

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,160
if you want to map also the available

132
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,199
clinical uh pathogenic missense

133
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,400
mutations in the context of your own

134
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,319
annotation you can select these

135
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,880
mutations from here and can map those

136
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,039
mutations. So now the orange spheres are

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,600
the clinical mutations and these blue

138
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,199
mutations are the mutations that you

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,880
have uploaded. Now from here you uh have

140
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,319
multiple options to um share the data

141
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,120
and also share this workflow. So for the

142
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
uh screen uh shot of uh the sequence

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,080
viewer you can click in this button and

144
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,800
you can also download all these data by

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,039
clicking here. You can download this

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,560
mapping on the structure by clicking on

147
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,440
the pimal script button. But here I'm

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,400
going to focus on how you can share this

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,720
entire workflow uh to a collaborator for

150
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,599
example and then the collaborators will

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,440
be able to load this entire session in

152
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,560
their computer.

153
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,720
So, let's uh hit share. And from here,

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm going to

155
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:43,240
share this um with um one of my other

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,240
personal email address

157
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,759
and I'll add it um and then I'll create

158
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,440
the link.

159
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:57,039
So now this link um will be accessible

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,319
only to this uh email address. So I'll

161
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,639
copy this and let's try to load it uh

162
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,639
separately.

163
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,199
Um so now you are given a prompt that

164
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,919
you need to sign in using the authorized

165
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:17,039
email address. So I will do that. Um and

166
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:21,039
then we'll need to copy that link one

167
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,240
more time and then this same uh session

168
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,639
that we created um is now available to

169
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,120
the collaborator. remember that this

170
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,959
session needs to be accessed uh within 7

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,800
days and then um we clear up the logs.

172
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,680
Um so uh this was about the workflow uh

173
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,399
for executing the interactive mapping of

174
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,120
genomics to proteins portal starting

175
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,399
with the gene protein identifier. So

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,720
stay tuned for the next tutorial where

177
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,120
uh I'm going to show a demo for the next

178
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,640
module which is start with your own

179
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,640
protein structure.
