13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,239
porous among the regularly repeating

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,680
Atomic patterns in them are tiny

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,760
interconnected openings or pores that

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,320
can trap molecules that just fit inside

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,039
them allow smaller ones to pass through

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,440
or block larger ones from entering a

Zite can remove unwanted molecules from

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,600
gases and liquids or trap them

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,320
temporarily and then release them or

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,239
hold them while they undergo rapid

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,079
chemical reactions some zeolites occur

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,920
naturally but they take unpredictable

25
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,000
forms and have variable sized pores

together the raw ingredients basically

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,119
silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide and

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
put them in a reactor for a few days at

40
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,960
a high temperature and pressure

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
depending on the ratio between the

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,520
ingredients and the temperature pressure

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,520
and timing as the initial gel slowly

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,680
solidifies into crystalline form

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,600
different zeolites emerge but there's

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,439
one special ingredient to add to help

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,799
the system go where you want to go says

48
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,600
Gomez bombelli it's a molecule that

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,399
serves as a template so that the zeolite

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,399
you want will crystallize around it and

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,920
create pores of the desired size and

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,600
shape the so-called templating molecule

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,520
binds the material before it solidifies

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,159
as crystallization progresses the

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,879
molecule directs the structure or

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,599
framework that forms around it after

57
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,440
crystallization the temperature is

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,000
raised and the templating molecule Burns

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,280
off leaving behind a solid alumino

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,120
silicate material filled with open pores

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,480
that are given the correct templating

62
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,280
molecule and synthesis conditions just

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,959
the right size and shape to recognize

64
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,720
the targeted

65
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,280
molecule the zeolite

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,640
conundrum theoretical studies suggests

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,239
that there should be hundreds of

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,519
thousands of possible zeolites but

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,800
despite some 60 years of intensive

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,080
research only about 250 zeolites have

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,599
been made this is sometimes called the

72
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,040
zeolite conundrum why haven't more been

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,319
made especially now when they could help

74
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,959
ongoing efforts to decarbonize energy

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,680
and the chemical industry One Challenge

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
is figuring out the best recipe for

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,080
making them factors such as the best

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
ratio between the silicon and aluminum

79
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,800
what cooking temperature to use and

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
whether to stir the ingredients all

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,599
influence the outcome but the real key

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
the researchers say lies in choosing a

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,080
templating molecule that's best for

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,959
producing the intended zolly framework

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
making that match is difficult there are

86
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,239
hundreds of known templating molecules

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,280
and potentially a million zeolites and

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,400
researchers are continually designing

89
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,920
new molecules because Millions more

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720
could be made and might work better for

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,959
decades the exploration of how to

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,760
synthesize a particular zeolite has been

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,920
done largely by trial and error a Time

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,879
cons uming expensive inefficient way to

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,159
go about it there's also been

96
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,519
considerable effort to use atomistic

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,560
atom by atom simulation to figure out

98
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,239
what known or novel templating molecule

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
to use to produce a given zeolite but

100
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,720
the experimental and modeling results

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,120
haven't generated reliable guidance in

102
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,159
many cases researchers have carefully

103
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,599
selected or designed a molecule to make

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,599
a particular zeolite but when they tried

105
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,480
their molecule in the lab the zelite

106
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,519
that formed wasn't what they expected or

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,159
desired so they need to start over those

108
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,120
experiences illustrate what Gomez

109
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,959
bombelli and his colleagues believe is

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,879
the problem that's been plaguing zeik

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,200
design for decades all the efforts both

112
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,760
experimental and theoretical have

113
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,480
focused on finding the templating

114
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,840
molecule that's best for forming a

115
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,079
specific zolly but what if that

116
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,280
templating molecule is also really good

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,919
or even better at forming some other

118
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,080
zeolite to determine the best molecule

119
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,199
for making a certain zeolite framework

120
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,479
and the best zeolite framework to act as

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,199
host to a a particular molecule the

122
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,000
researchers decided to look at both

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,000
sides of the pairing Daniel Schwab Kota

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,440
PhD 22 a former member of Gomez bom

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,479
barelli's group and now a postdoctoral

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,800
fellow at Lawrence Livermore National

127
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,320
Laboratory describes the process as a

128
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,039
sort of dance with molecules and

129
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,840
zeolites in a room looking for partners

130
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,479
each molecule wants to find a partner

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,000
zey and each zey wants to find a partner

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,520
molecule he says but it's not enough to

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,479
find a good dance partner from the

134
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,240
perspective of only one dance answer the

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,240
potential partner could prefer to dance

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,759
with someone else after all so it needs

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
to be a particularly good pairing the

138
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,680
upshot you need to look from the

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,800
perspective of each of them to find the

140
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,080
best match from both perspectives the

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,919
researchers need to try every molecule

142
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,360
with every zly and quantify how well the

143
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,280
pairings

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,199
worked a broader metric for evaluating

145
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,440
pairs before performing that analysis

146
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,479
the researchers defined a new evaluating

147
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,160
metric that they could use to rank each

148
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,520
templating molecule zeolite pair the

149
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,199
standard metric for measuring the

150
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,400
Affinity between a molecule and a

151
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,000
zeolite is binding energy that is how

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,080
strongly the molecule clings to the

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,280
zeolite or conversely how much energy is

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,199
required to separate the two while

155
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,120
recognizing the value of that metric the

156
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,440
MIT Le team wanted to take more

157
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,479
parameters into account their new

158
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,800
evaluating metric therefore includes not

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,080
only binding energy but also the size

160
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
shape and volume of the molecule and the

161
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,919
opening in in the zeolite framework and

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
their approach calls for tuning the

163
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,440
molecule to different orientations to

164
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,759
find the best possible fit Affinity

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,639
scores for all molecule zeolite pairs

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,000
based on that evaluating metric would

167
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,560
enable zeolite researchers to answer two

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
key questions what templating molecule

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
will form the zeolite that I want and if

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,039
I use that templating molecule what

171
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,800
other zeolites might it form instead

172
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,319
using the molecule zeolite Affinity

173
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
scores researchers could first identify

174
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,599
molecules that look good for making a

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
desired Z

176
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,560
they could then rule out the ones that

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,800
also look good for forming other

178
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,720
zeolites leaving a set of molecules

179
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,759
deemed to be highly selective for making

180
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,840
the desired

181
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,880
seite validating the approach a rich

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,960
literature but does their new metric

183
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,960
work better than the standard one to

184
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,360
find out the team needed to perform

185
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,880
atomistic simulations using their new

186
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,120
evaluating metric and then Benchmark the

187
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,039
results against experimental evidence

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,680
reported in the literature there are

189
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,280
many thousands of Journal articles

190
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,080

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,360
based on those findings the researchers

215
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,960
used their new evaluating metric and a

216
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,520
novel atomistic simulation technique to

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,639
examine more than half a million

218
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,919
templating molecule zeolite

219
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,879

220
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,879
experimental outcomes reported in more

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,800
than a th000 journal articles indeed the

222
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,680
new metric outperformed the traditional

223
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,560
binding energy metric and their

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,159
simulations were orders of magnitude

225
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,479
faster than traditional

226
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,440
approaches ready for experimental

227
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,440
investigations

228
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,080
now the researchers were ready to put

229
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,640
their approach to the test they would

230
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,240
use it to design new tempting molecules

231
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,519
and try them out in experiments

232
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,880
performed by a team led by Yuri Roman

233
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,080
leav the Robert T Hassam 1911 professor

234
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,720
of chemical engineering and a team from

235
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,120
the Instituto de technia chem in

236
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,959
Valencia Spain led by Manuel mulliner

237
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,320
and avalino corma one set of experiments

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,959
focused on a zeolite called chabazite

239
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,200
which is used in catalytic converters

240
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,160
for vehicles

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,959
using their techniques the researchers

242
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,720
designed a new templating molecule for

243
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,320
synthesizing chabazite and the

244
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,800
experimental results confirmed their

245
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,480
approach their analyses had shown the

246
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,200
new templating molecule would be good

247
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,240
for forming chabazite and not for

248
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,680
forming anything else its binding

249
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,680
strength isn't as high as other

250
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,120
molecules for chabazite so people hadn't

251
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,720
used it says gas bombelli but it's

252
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,920
pretty good and it's not good for

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,160
anything else so it's selective and it's

254
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,399
way cheaper than the usual ones in

255
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,120
addition in their new molecule the

256
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,399
electrical charge is distributed

257
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,760
differently than in the traditional ones

258
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,480
which led to new possibilities the

259
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,839
researchers found that by adjusting both

260
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,320
the shape and charge of the molecule

261
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
they could control where the negative

262
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,720
charge occurs on the pore that's created

263
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,240
in the final zeolite the charge

264
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,240
placement that results can make the

265
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,920
chabasite a much better Catalyst than it

266
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,959
was before says Gomez bombelli so our

267
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,560
same rules for molecule design also

268
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,720
determine where the negative charge is

269
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,200
going to end up which can lead to whole

270
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,120
different classes of catalysts schel

271
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,880
Cota describes another experiment that

272
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,959
demonstrates the importance of molecular

273
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,959
shape as well as the types of new

274
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,839
materials made possible using the team's

275
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:12,800
approach in one striking example the

276
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,640
team designed a templating molecule with

277
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,000
a height and width that's halfway

278
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,240
between those of two molecules that are

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,360
now commonly used one for making

280
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,320
chabazite and the other for making a

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,760
zeolite called AEI every new zealite

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,399
structure is examined by the

283
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,839
international zeolite Association and

284
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,079
once approved receives a three-letter

285
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,160
designation experiments using that in

286
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,279
between templating molecule resulted in

287
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,440
the formation of not one zeolite or the

288
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,760
other but a combination of the two in a

289
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,560
single solid the result Blends two

290
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,360
different structures together in a way

291
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,920
that the final result is better than the

292
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,519
sum of its parts says schabot the

293
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,560
catalyst is like the one used in

294
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,760
catalytic converters in today's trucks

295
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,760
only better it's more efficient in

296
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,240
converting nitrogen oxides to harmless

297
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
nitrogen gases in water and because of

298
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,320
the two different pore es in the

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,519
aluminous silicate composition it works

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,839
well in exhaust that's fairly hot as

301
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,360
during normal operation and also an

302
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:13,760
exhaust that's fairly cool as during

303
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,240
startup putting the work into

304
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,480
practice as with all materials the

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,240
commercial viability of a zly will

306
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
depend in part on the cost of making it

307
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,680
the researcher's technique can identify

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
promising templating molecules but some

309
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,320
of them may be difficult to synthesize

310
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,600
in the lab as a result the overall cost

311
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
of that molecule zeolite combination may

312
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,000
be too high to be competitive Gomez

313
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,920
bombelli and his team therefore include

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,920
in their assessment process a

315
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,279
calculation of cost for synthesizing

316
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,000
each templating molecule they identified

317
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,440
generally the most expensive part of

318
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,320
making a given zeolite they use a

319
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,480
publicly available model devised in 2018

320
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,839
by Connor KY ph19 now the Henry Singer

321
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,399
1957 Career Development assistant

322
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,079
professor of chemical engineering at MIT

323
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,279
the model takes into account all the

324
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,160
starting materials and the step-by-step

325
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,000
chemical reactions needed to produce the

326
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,000
targeted templating molecule however

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,480
commercialization decisions aren't based

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,199
solely on cost sometimes there's a

329
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
trade-off between cost and performance

330
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,920
for instance given our chabazite

331
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,079
findings would customers or the

332
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,480
community trade a little bit of activity

333
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,839
for a 100 fold decrease in the cost of

334
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,600
the templating molecule says Gomez

335
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
bombelli the answer is likely yes so

336
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,399
we've made a tool that can help them

337
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,079
navigate that tradeoff and there are

338
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,279
other factors to consider for example is

339
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,199
this templating molecule truly novel

340
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,639
where of others already studied it or

341
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:43,399
perhaps even hold a patent on it while

342
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,800
an algorithm can guide development of

343
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,320
templating molecules and quantify

344
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,199
specific molecule zeolite matches other

345
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,600
types of assessments are best left to

346
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,320
expert judgment notes Shota we need a

347
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,519
partnership between computational

348
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,279
analysis and human intuition and

experience to that end the MIT

350
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,920
researchers and their colleagues decided

351
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,240
to share their techniques and findings

352
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,600
with other zeolite researchers led by

353
