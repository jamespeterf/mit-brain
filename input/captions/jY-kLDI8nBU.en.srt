1
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,040
Let's get right into it. I have there's

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,440
a bunch that I want I want to try to

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,439
catch up from yesterday. Um, you've just

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,400
turned in paper number one, but I'm a

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,320
big fan of trying to have people do work

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
um like do the daily work in the class

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
thinking towards what the major

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
assignments are. So, now I have to tell

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,880
you about paper number two. Um, for

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
paper number two, you're going to

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,440
identify a specific learning

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,920
environment. You're going to identify

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,559
uh like the physics department at MIT,

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,280
your middle school, your elementary

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,000
school, your high school for world

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
languages department, um an afterchool

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,280
program you work with a library, but

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
something like very specific where you

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,719
know not not not not you know like

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,680
schools in general, a place um and

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
you're going to um reflect upon a

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,920
particular education technology and you

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,920
either going to recommend or not

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
recommend that they adopt this

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,080
particular technology. Um so part of the

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,840
argument that you'll read about in the

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,200
in hopefully through the first half of

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,920
failure to disrupt um is that while we

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,159
can get a general sense of the efficacy

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,840
of different technologies, we could we

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,200
could say, you know, this class of

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
technologies seems to have better

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
research evidence behind it than this

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
class of technologies. There's really

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,920
nothing that anyone has ever invented

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,560
which is like really every school or

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,479
every department ought to be using X. um

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,400
all those decisions have to do with um

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,720
particular times, particular places,

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,880
particular people. Um so what you'll

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,799
have to do is um identify some

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,880
technology, kind of classify it like

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
what genre is it from or what is it

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,799
like? Um what are its potential

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
benefits? What are its affordances? What

46
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
are its limitations? And then what is

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
the characteristic of the place that

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,720
you're recommending it to? And do the

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,560
sort of benefits and needs and

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,960
characteristics of a place all line up

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
such that you recommend adoption? Um or

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,600
do they not line up such that you don't

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,920
recommend adoption? Um it's a it should

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,759
be a memo sort of directed to a

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
particular stakeholder, a department

56
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,360
head, an assistant superintendent for

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
curriculum instruction, the library

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,239
director, the president of the Boys and

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
Girls Club, whatever it is. I think uh I

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
had one student who was building a

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,160
program for Ukrainian refugees last year

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
and he basically wrote a memo to himself

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,360
um which was fine. on pages 74 through

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
76 in failure to disrupt which at least

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
in the hard cover I think it's the same

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
in the in the paperback um there's a

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,560
section called what a department head

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
should do which is not exactly this

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
assignment but like a pretty close

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,400
worked example um it's sort of me like

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
working through um so whatever I I think

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
that ex that specific example is about

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
using intelligent tutors so you in math

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,920
class so you should pick something other

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,080
than that specific example um for you to

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,400
use um but uh um you know you you should

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
think about doing things like, you know,

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
um assessing the claims that the

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,720
developers of this technology make,

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,800
seeing what kind of research evidence

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,720
there is around that. Um seeing under

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,879
what sort of context this seems to work

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,159
or not, what kind of enabling conditions

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,159
are required, whether or not those

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,599
enabling conditions exist. Um we'll talk

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,519
about all these kinds of things over the

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,400
next few weeks. Um so that uh um so you

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,360
don't have to understand what you're

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
going to do right now, but I want you to

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,720
have a sense of this assignment. Um it

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,800
for some of you, you will pick a a

92
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,200
context that you can work with that you

93
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,560
actually know a ton about. Um that or

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,519
like even if you didn't know something

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
about it, you would be able to like like

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,640
oh the you know the head of Aereroastro

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
is a good colleague of mine. I'm going

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,519
to just go ask him what he thinks about

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
this or like whether what capacity are

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
and things like that. There may be other

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,959
things that you sort of need to

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
fabricate um which you would be allowed

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,599
to fabricate. You just have to like

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,120
somewhere stipulate along the way that

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,480
you're fabricating them. So I know you I

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
have to be like um you know the

107
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,000
characteristics of the world language

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,599
teachers in my high school are this and

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,159
you might not actually know who the new

110
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,439
staff are and things like that but um uh

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,040
but but that would be okay. Um

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,640
uh there's pages written about what

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,840
you're supposed to do in the syllabus,

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,280
but that does that give you like a

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
general sense of the target that you

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,239
should be thinking about over the um I

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
don't remember I don't even remember the

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
exact day it's due, but it's like

119
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
roughly a month from now. Each

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,400
assignment takes about a third of the

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,919
class. So um that all seem good. Great.

122
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,519
Um,

123
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,160
uh, anybody have any questions that they

124
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
want to ask about that

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,160
assignment? Okay. Um, let's wrap up

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,000
MOOs. So, last time we were talking

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
about MOOs sort of made these three big

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
bets. Um, that they could provide new

129
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,199
pathways into higher education for

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
people with limited access. Um, that

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
they could reorganize, disrupt, unbundle

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,960
higher education. They could create like

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,320
new structures across higher education.

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
And then the one that I was most

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,440
involved in is that they create a new

136
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
datadriven science of learning. Um I

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,960
maybe part of the second one but maybe

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,639
sort of um you know maybe was clearly a

139
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,400
bet for some actors less so for

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,440
nonprofits more so for for profofits was

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560
that you could make a whole bunch of

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,040
money doing this. Um that has not panned

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,280
out as well as some people had hoped. Um

144
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,479
so here's an announcement today um that

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,199
Accenture is purchasing Udacity. Um, so

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,440
Udacity was the company that was founded

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
by Sebastian Thrun. Sebastian Thrun is

148
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
one of the people who taught this intro

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
to AI class that like made the whole MOO

150
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,880
phenomenon start. Um, people are not

151
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
exact. Um, uh, Accenture is like a

152
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,320
consulting firm and they're going to use

153
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,960
it to do sort of AI training. So, so

154
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,280
this is so this is not like transforming

155
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
all of education. This is doing like

156
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,440
pretty wellestablished executive

157
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,199
education. Um, and there may be ways

158
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,199
that you could do executive education

159
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,560
better with the MOO platform than you

160
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,840
could with other pre-existing

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,840
technologies or strategies or things

162
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,840
like this, but like this is not going to

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,759
profoundly change the way executive

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360
education unfolds. This is just like,

165
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
you know, somebody who sells executive

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,080
education buying a potential provider of

167
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,960
it. Um, in the notes here, it says that

168
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,919
uh their best guess is well, they is

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
that they they uh um a deal fell through

170
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,440
with an asking price of about $80

171
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,039
million. And so they nobody knows for

172
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,560
sure, but they think that this deal was

173
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,360
probably about that size. Um but uh um

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Udacity took in $300 million um of

175
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
investment. So I I don't go to the Sloan

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,639
School of Management like some of you

177
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,560
do, but I'm pretty sure that if you take

178
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,520
$300 million and sell a thing for $80

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,039
million, you didn't do it right. Um or

180
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,919
or at least your investors don't think

181
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,840
so. Um, but I think that's some, you

182
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,160
know, to me it's a great indication of

183
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
where these partic where this like class

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
of technologies have settled out. Um,

185
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,759
which is like $80 million is a lot of

186
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,039
money. If any of you if any of you were

187
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,919
offered $80 million for a business,

188
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,440
you'd probably be like, "Yeah, that's

189
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,720
pretty I'll take $8 million. That seems

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,720
great." Um, uh, but what what it's

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,479
accomplishing is like a very um a very

192
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
wellestablished existing thing in the

193
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,000
education system. You might say that um

194
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,680
or a way that I've phrased it in the

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,319
book is which I which a colleague of

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,479
mine Mim Emo really came up with um is

197
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
that uh these technologies did not

198
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,319
disrupt education systems. They were

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
domesticated by education systems.

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,319
Education systems said like you fit

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,599
there like you little company you would

202
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
be pretty good at doing executive

203
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,520
education. Why don't you do that? Um

204
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
that is not at all what Sebastian Thrun

205
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,720
was envisioning when he said that there

206
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
might be only 50 educational

207
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,759
institutions in higher education in the

208
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,919
world. Um um but to me this is like this

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,319
is like very representative of how I

210
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,400
think education technology often works.

211
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
Um we very rarely build things that are

212
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,160
totally transformative and we can often

213
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,960
build things that are like useful in

214
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,520
pretty specific contexts. Um

215
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,960
uh I had I and lots of other people had

216
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,280
really hoped that there would be very

217
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,240
new kinds of science that would be

218
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,840
possible. Um, so we had never really in

219
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,000
higher education had a system where you

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
just had all of a sudden millions and

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,520
millions of people doing online

222
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
learning. Um, and all of that was being

223
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
recorded. Um, so when I got hired to

224
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
help sort of build the research

225
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
infrastructure for Harvard X and MITx

226
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
and edex, uh, you know, one of the most

227
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
exciting things was like all of these

228
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,879
people are signing up and they're all

229
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,479
clicking and we're recording everything.

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,400
Um, what you know, you might think of

231
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,759
like when you went to think think of all

232
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
of the things that you did in school.

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,720
Probably even better as an example, like

234
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
think about all the things that I did in

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,759
school. Um, so I filled out zillions of

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,360
worksheets. I typed all kinds of papers.

237
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
Like all that stuff just ended up in my

238
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
mom's attic and was eventually thrown

239
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
away. Like the whole records of my

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,080
learning were lost. Um, but young people

241
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
today have their records of learning

242
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,880
stored in all of these online platforms.

243
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,200
If you saw what millions of learners

244
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,360
were doing um in really granular,

245
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
detailed ways over days or months or

246
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
years, shouldn't you be able to figure

247
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
out all kinds of exciting things about

248
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
the science of learning about like what

249
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,440
are the most effective teaching

250
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
techniques? How do people learn best?

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,839
All all kinds of things that might be

252
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,959
helpless. Um and it proved to be much

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,800
much harder um than people expected. I

254
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
would say the core reason why it proved

255
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,200
to be really hard um is that you can

256
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,200
have terabytes of data about what people

257
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,440
click and still not really know what's

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,080
going on in their heads. Um what what

259
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,160
what people click on on a screen or what

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
they add as an answer to a problem

261
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,080
doesn't necessarily tell you all that

262
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
much about the cognition that they went

263
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
through to get there. Um it doesn't tell

264
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
you a whole lot about which parts of the

265
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
instruction that they received to that

266
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
point helped them do that. There was a

267
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,240
whole for years there was a whole class

268
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,000
of papers that just sort of correlated

269
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
everything to everything else like how

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
many times did you click, how many times

271
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,839
did you log in, um how many units did

272
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,760
you do, how far apart they were, how all

273
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,519
these kinds of things and basically like

274
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,200
there was a whole a whole series of

275
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,680
papers that were all published that were

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,519
all along the lines of people who do

277
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
more stuff do better than people who do

278
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
less stuff. Um like if like people who

279
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,200
clicked more often in the systems,

280
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
people who like watched all the videos

281
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
did better on the problems, people who

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,720
did all the problems were more likely to

283
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,399
pass the course, people who logged in

284
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,760
more time, people who spent more hours

285
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,080
were more likely to pass the course.

286
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,839
Like none of that is interesting. Like

287
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,440
you didn't need a $60 million research

288
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,839
enterprise to figure out that doing more

289
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,839
stuff helps people learn. Um there are a

290
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,040
few things that we did um that uh and

291
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,440
I'll talk about them more as the

292
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,000
semester goes on that tried to go beyond

293
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,240
that. Um there were a bunch of us who

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,200
are really interested in this idea that

295
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
like um uh a bunch of people have done

296
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
research that suggests that the

297
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
attitudes that you bring to a learning

298
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,440
experience really matter for your

299
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,079
success in that learning experience. Um

300
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
how many of you ever heard of stereotype

301
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,720
threat? Um so stereotype threat is this

302
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,680
idea that if we tr if we trigger

303
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,959
stereotypes that people have um as they

304
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
enter a learning environment or as

305
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
they're in a learning environment um

306
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,399
those stereotypes can negatively impact

307
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,560
them. Um so if you ask people to

308
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
describe their gender before a math test

309
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,240
then people who identify as girls are

310
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
more likely to do less well. Um you

311
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
could do the same thing in different

312
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
racial configurations and other kinds of

313
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,120
things like that. Um, and the way that

314
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,959
you can inoculate people in theory

315
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
against some of these kinds of things is

316
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,680
by emphasizing how they belong. Um, is

317
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,200
by saying like you belong in here, like

318
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
you have a space, you deserve to be

319
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
here. And so, um, you could you could

320
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,360
imagine that if people go into a

321
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
learning environment and they're like,

322
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
I'm not sure if this is for me. Then

323
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
like you're sort of like you're paying

324
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,200
attention to not feeling like this is

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,880
for me and you're not paying attention

326
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
to the learning and then a test comes

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,519
along and you don't do as well on that

328
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,040
test and then that makes you feel like

329
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
you belong even less and then you're

330
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,320
feeling kind of more unbelonging and

331
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,839
then you don't do as well and you get a

332
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
negative cycle. You can imagine the

333
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
opposite where you feel like oh I

334
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
definitely belong in this learning

335
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
environment like this is going to be a

336
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
good growth experience for me and then

337
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,200
you like are focused on learning and

338
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,040
then you do better and that makes you

339
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,880
feel like you belong and on and on. Um,

340
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,000
so the we were really interested in

341
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,079
these entry points. Um, and um, almost

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
every MOO that basically every class at

343
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
Harvard MIT offered had a little

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
precourse survey at the Have any of you

345
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
ever taken a class that has like a

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,560
little survey at the beginning of it for

347
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,079
your mukes? If you did it for Harvard

348
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,120
MIT, I probably wrote it. Um, and uh,

349
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,120
especially if you did it a few years

350
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,440
ago.

351
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,440
Um, and uh, so we started randomly

352
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,079
assigning people these little

353
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
interventions. Um, we would like you'd

354
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
answer a bunch of questions about what

355
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,880
you know about the topic and then we'd

356
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
say things like, um, write a letter to a

357
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,360
future student. Oh, I hear one was a

358
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
values affirmation. Um, pick from this

359
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,720
list which of these values are really

360
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,800
important to you. Um, and they I don't

361
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
know, they could be like loyalty,

362
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,959
personal growth, family, all kinds of

363
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,839
things. Um, write a short letter to

364
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,240
yourself about why taking this class

365
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,519
aligns with those values. Um, so asking

366
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
people to just like write for a few

367
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
minutes about why we do other things

368
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,040
about belonging, write a short, write a

369
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
short letter to a future student in this

370
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,279
class about why they should feel like

371
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,120
they belong, things like that. Um, and

372
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,519
our hope was is it would have this kind

373
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,959
of like, you know, trigger this positive

374
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,240
cascade at the beginning of the class.

375
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
You feel like you belong more, you feel

376
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,959
like you value it more, you do better,

377
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
you pay attention more, you do better,

378
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,720
you learn more, all those kinds of

379
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:03,760
things. Um we started by trying these in

380
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,279
just a couple of classes. Um and the

381
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,079
even if we were picking a couple of

382
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,839
classes, we were still doing like some

383
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,839
of the largest experiments that had ever

384
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
been conducted in higher education. Um

385
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,440
you know, we could pick like a couple of

386
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,040
classes that might have 10,000 people

387
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,480
that were actively participating in it

388
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,399
and doing our our things and things like

389
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
that. Kind of a lot of folks. Um so here

390
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,680
are four things that we tried. Um one

391
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,760
was plan making. um having people write

392
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,200
down exactly how they planned to

393
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,440
complete the class, like when they were

394
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
going to do it, um who was going to help

395
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,920
them, how what they were going to do

396
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,680
when they get stuck, those kinds of

397
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,240
things. Um this value relevance things

398
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,240
that you just described. Um and then

399
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
mental contrasting with implementation

400
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
intentions is basically like what are

401
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,560
the kinds of things that might make you

402
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,279
stuck um and how would you get unstuck

403
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,160
when you encounter these things? um when

404
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,399
we did them in one or two classes at a

405
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,519
time, they worked pretty well. Um so I

406
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,519
don't know how familiar you are with

407
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
statistics, but the beta parameters are

408
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
the one you look at. So this plan making

409
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,800
things, people were were four percentage

410
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,320
points more likely to finish the class

411
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,959
if they got the intervention that they

412
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
didn't. Um that's huge. That's that's

413
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,480
you know, if you ask you ask people to

414
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
do something for five minutes at the

415
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
beginning of the class and they're 4%

416
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,440
more likely to finish it. Um just like

417
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,240
the cost benefit of that is off the

418
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,160
charts. That's fabulous. Um, uh, this

419
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,920
one was getting people to do more

420
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
activities, getting people to persist

421
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
longer, getting people to complete

422
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,160
better. Um, all these kinds of things.

423
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,760
And some, you know, some of these

424
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,480
studies were huge, you know, 5,000

425
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,839
people, 3,000 people, 2,000 people. Um,

426
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,600
that's pretty good. Um, we then were

427
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,680
like, we were we were pretty excited

428
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
about ourselves. We're like like we've

429
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
come up with some stuff that like

430
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
doesn't cost anything and really helps

431
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,680
learners. Um, let's go ahead and take

432
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,240
these things and use them in all of the

433
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,519
classes. Let's let's let Harvard and MIT

434
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,680
let us test things in every class. Um

435
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,760
and it is not uncommon in um educational

436
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,519
research that if something works in a

437
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,000
little space that when you try it at

438
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,399
much bigger scales it doesn't work. Um

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,760
that is a very frustrating finding but

440
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,079
also very common finding and that is

441
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,360
exactly what happened to us. Um so we

442
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,480
took these things that would which you

443
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,639
know again would have been considered

444
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,360
like huge studies in education you know

445
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,920
randomly assigning 4,000 people to to a

446
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,519
treatment or not is is enormous. Um and

447
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,399
we did it with a quarter of a million

448
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,480
people. Um which like a lot of learners.

449
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,079
Um and basic and basically everything

450
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
that we had tried and wrote a bunch of

451
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,440
papers that said hey these are pretty

452
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,920
good ideas we had to be like actually

453
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,920
they don't really work that well. Um,

454
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,600
and

455
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,839
uh, I part of the problem was they would

456
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,720
uh, they would they appeared to work in

457
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,519
some classes but not others and we

458
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,519
couldn't make any sense of why. Um, part

459
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
of that is that it's hard for us to know

460
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
a whole lot if you're we did it in about

461
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,639
250 classes and it's hard to know the

462
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,680
difference between those those different

463
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,079
kinds of things. Um but we like you know

464
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
we we listed characteristics of a lot of

465
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,360
classes and we put them into big AI

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
models to try to figure out why and all

467
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
these other I mean you can read the

468
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,880
paper. Um but uh it was sort of an

469
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,199
enormous effort and at the end of it you

470
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,040
know a thing that we we we had lots of

471
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,639
people in there but we weren't able to

472
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,440
identify things that worked particularly

473
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,839
well. Um and this was pretty consistent

474
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,279
across this enterprise. Um in fact to my

475
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,759
knowledge there's virtually no one who's

476
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,519
doing research on Harvard or MITx

477
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,399
Arvidex or MITx classes anymore. Um and

478
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,880
uh um and so this was the sort of third

479
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,800
of these big bets. um you know the the

480
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,560
hypothesis was that vast new you know

481
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,440
there are people like Peter Norvig and

482
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
uh um who's a woman um Daffhne Coller

483
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,279
who formed Corsera who thought that um

484
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,759
datadriven education would be very

485
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,839
similar to datadriven uh medicine like

486
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,920
just like the human genome project sort

487
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,560
of revolutionized a datadriven form of

488
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,320
medicine that you know Corsera edex

489
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
could revolutionize a data driven form

490
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,720
of the science of learning um and we we

491
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,639
knew a lot about what people clicked but

492
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,279
we never really got much more data about

493
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
what was going on inside people's heads.

494
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,760
Um the other sort of huge issue is that

495
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,480
if you really want to do educational

496
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,760
research that studies like how to help

497
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,120
people learn better, you re you need

498
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,480
variation in the course that's deeper

499
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,679
than what we were attempting. Like you

500
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
need to be able to do more than just

501
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,919
change a little thing at the beginning

502
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,439
of the course. You have to be like,

503
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,959
well, here's one good way of teaching a

504
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,480
class. Here's another good way of

505
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
teaching the class. Let's, you know,

506
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,679
let's try both of them. Well, it turns

507
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
out that like it was very difficult to

508
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
go to faculty and be like, will you make

509
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,039
two versions of this course um so that

510
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
we can test some of these different

511
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,960
ideas in them? Um because people had

512
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,000
barely enough time and resources to make

513
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,880
one version of the course and so forth.

514
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,200
Um so like the other two big bets mukes

515
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,679
um they for the most part uh didn't pan

516
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,679
out. Um, and I think if you if you if

517
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,160
you go back 10 years from now and read

518
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,679
the um, you know, the op-eds that David

519
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
Brooks and Thomas Freriedman were

520
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,440
writing in the New York Times about the

521
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,520
totally transformative impact of online

522
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,280
education, um, people would be pretty

523
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
surprised 10 years later to find out

524
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,760
that like, you know, it's good for

525
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,280
things like executive education um, or

526
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,720
helping people earn a second master's

527
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,480
degree, which are not bad things to do,

528
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,000
but again, there's sort of smaller

529
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
components of it.

530
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,440
Um, I've thought a lot over the last

531
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,000
couple years about like, okay, so if

532
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,919
we're not going to totally reform the

533
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,320
educational system with independent

534
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,720
self-paced online learning, um, what

535
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,880
else might we do? Um, well, you know, so

536
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,480
for instance, I've told you that, um,

537
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,960
already affluent, already educated

538
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
people are reasonably likely to persist

539
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
in online courses. Um, well, there are

540
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,840
all kinds of already affluent, already

541
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
educated people who work in the public

542
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
interest. There are people who are

543
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,520
teachers. There are people who work in

544
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
public health. There are people who work

545
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,440
in nurses. Um lots of them work in

546
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
contexts where they don't have a lot of

547
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,320
learning um after their college degree

548
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,720
um or their advanced degree. So what if

549
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,240
we created online courses um that you

550
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,559
know a good fraction of people would be

551
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,000
able to persist in and finish um that

552
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,039
would be able to help them. Um there was

553
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,559
one course that we built um called uh

554
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:08,000
launching innovation in schools which

555
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:09,840
relates to uh um uh uh um the stuff in

556
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
iterate that you read a couple classes

557
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,960
ago. Um, and in our course we make them,

558
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
we make all of our, not everybody did

559
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
this, we make all of our courses openly

560
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
licensed. Um, so we we we make it so

561
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
that it's creative common. Anybody can

562
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
take our things and do anything they

563
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
want with them. Um, there were some

564
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,400
folks in Ukraine before the war who had

565
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,480
translated our courses into Ukrainian

566
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,480
and put them on a Ukrainian platform.

567
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
Um, and for a while at the beginning of

568
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,799
the war, I don't know if this is still

569
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,320
true, teachers still had to like get

570
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,120
reertified, do training and things like

571
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,039
that. Um, so some some enormous fraction

572
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,880
of the Ukrainian teaching force had at

573
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,400
least, you know, signed up and plausibly

574
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
taken one of these courses and things

575
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
like that. Um, so there sort of, you

576
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,160
know, for us it was kind of a proof of

577
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,720
concept that people, uh, um, can benefit

578
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,360
from some of these kinds of things. Um,

579
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,919
with Mariana's adviser, uh, Jose, we got

580
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,840
really interested in, um, what if the

581
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,400
thing you want is not really big MOO

582
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,160
providers, but very small local MOO

583
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
providers. Um, so there's an

584
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,720
organization called Edrock in Georgia in

585
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Jord um, Jordan run by the Queen Rana

586
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,640
Foundation that makes mukes in Arabic

587
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,120
for people in the Arabic world. Um,

588
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,440
there are like lots of providers that

589
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,720
offer courses in the local language of

590
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,080
their environment that are tailored to

591
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,280
the particular environments that they're

592
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
in. Um, and

593
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,160
um, these tables are unreadable but

594
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,559
except if you go in them and look at

595
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,360
them. Um, but you know, there's evidence

596
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,039
that you could actually do a better job

597
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,360
getting people from more diverse

598
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,760
educational backgrounds if you offer

599
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,159
them in local languages, with local

600
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,679
providers, um, with the with the topic

601
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
area and content areas that would be

602
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
interesting to people in those local

603
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:47,120
places. Um, so what we needed was not

604
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,080
sort of like, you know, giant global

605
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,640
elite driven online learning. Um, but

606
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,559
maybe maybe another pathway be with like

607
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
lots of distributed local online

608
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
learning that was particularly par, you

609
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
know, tailored to people's cultural

610
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,919
interests and labor markets and civic

611
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,559
spheres and needs and things like that.

612
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,159
Um, and there might be, you know, um, I

613
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,520
mean, I always try to sort of remain

614
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,679
open to the idea that that any of these

615
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,919
technologies could have new people that

616
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,000
come along and refresh the ideas around

617
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,720
them. Um, but we should we should

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,480
probably think of those claims with like

619
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,080
a pretty high bar. You know, if someone

620
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
comes along and says they have like a

621
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,840
new AI powered MOO platform or something

622
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,200
like that, you you know, now you could

623
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,200
be like, well, let me tell you what the

624
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,960
research suggests about the original MOO

625
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,039
platform. Um, what some of the

626
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,559
limitations were, what it accomplished,

627
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,960
why it tackled some big problems that

628
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:43,280
turned out to be really hard. Um and uh

629
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,640
uh why you know and then and then you

630
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
know what what is it that what is it

631
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,200
that a new effort would be able to build

632
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,480
on top of that? Um those are some of the

633
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
things I want to tell you about MOOs.

634
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,520
What other things struck you about them

635
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,039
or what questions did you have or um

636
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,799
what what have we discussed in the last

637
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,960
few classes that fit or don't fit with

638
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,960
your experiences?

639
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,320
I mean, I guess just a general question

640
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,799
is like what is the real motivation for

641
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,880
like higher educational institutions to

642
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,720
want mukes to exist considering that

643
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,840
their entire business is based off of

644
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,840
them? Not it was it was it's weird,

645
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,520
right? Yeah, like like people got super

646
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,720
enthusiastic for a long time about

647
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,159
digitizing faculty labor. Um I I would

648
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
you know so what were some of the things

649
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,640
people would have said at the time? Um

650
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,200
in 2013 people would have said something

651
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,200
along the lines of for particularly for

652
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,440
the last 40 or 50 years but maybe for

653
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
100 plus years um there's a class of

654
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,840
universities that brags every year about

655
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,520
how many students they don't serve. um

656
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,159
you know around around around this time

657
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,600
every year you know um Stanford and MIT

658
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
and Harvard will publish statistics

659
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,679
about how many applicants they rejected.

660
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Um but one of the things that they could

661
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,159
do with MOOs is start bragging about how

662
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,880
many people they served. Um for the for

663
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,640
the faculty who especially early on who

664
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
got who got millions of people to sign

665
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
up for their courses, it was

666
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,280
exhilarating. Um it was incredibly

667
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,120
exciting to be able to say like you know

668
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,640
I mean a nan argawal used to say you

669
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,080
know if I said if I taught uh 61 at at

670
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,679
MIT for the next 40 years um you know I

671
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
I still couldn't have as many students

672
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,559
who showed up in the first round of this

673
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,960
class that I offered and things like

674
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,320
that. So that was exciting. Um I do I

675
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,280
have a hunch that um that when people

676
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,360
were afraid that this might profoundly

677
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,280
change the education landscape that

678
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,520
elite universities wanted to be in front

679
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,559
of it rather than behind it. Um like as

680
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080
soon as there were some commercial

681
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,400
offerings that were available. There

682
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,520
were folks who said like man um we

683
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,960
really ought to have um we ra have a

684
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,039
nonprofit alternative. We ought to have

685
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,799
universities are involved in this. Um I

686
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,400
mean another really important structural

687
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,960
factor is that

688
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,440
um university revenue sources are

689
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
constantly under threat and they're

690
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,080
constantly going up. Um so health care

691
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,520
costs are constantly going up,

692
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,559
technology costs are constantly going

693
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,000
up. Um and if you're a state university

694
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,919
like across the United States, we've

695
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,240
been dramatically reducing the amount

696
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,559
that like the taxpaying public support

697
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,919
schools and asking students to pay more

698
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,960
tuition and so forth or a higher

699
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,240
percentage of their tuition. Um, and so

700
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
a bunch of folks thought they could make

701
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,559
money doing that. You know, not like

702
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,960
make money in the sense of putting in

703
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,640
their pocket, but um, make make money

704
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,039
uh, doing that. So those were those are

705
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,840
some of the kinds of reasons um, that

706
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,400
people got really excited about it. Um,

707
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,720
but uh, but yeah, in in retrospect, in

708
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
some ways, you're like like what, you

709
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,840
know, why why do I mean at the time

710
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,440
there were definitely plenty of people

711
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,000
who are like, you want to take this

712
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,080
thing that we sell to people for $80,000

713
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,120
a year and give them to them for free?

714
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,039
like what kind of plan is that? Um or

715
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,400
you know for 35 bucks or other kinds of

716
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,720
things like that.

717
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,159
Um, one thing that I was thinking about

718
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,000
uh with like respect to like presenting

719
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,840
books as like helping underserved

720
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,960
communities and stuff is like the issue

721
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,799
of like space cuz to me I feel like um

722
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,880
like having been in like a pretty

723
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,720
underserved like high school and stuff I

724
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,000
was like okay well but even like in a

725
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,720
position of higher education space is a

726
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,559
very big issue for a lot of these spaces

727
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,480
where it's like you simply can't just

728
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,640
sit at home and even if you have access

729
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,279
to a laptop or something to do that and

730
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,760
it was like I I just wanted to know if I

731
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,760
mean this bike kind of also like just

732
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,799
connect to the larger social aspect of

733
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,279
it but I was wondering if they had if

734
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,360
this even came up when they were talking

735
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,520
about like the accessibility of these

736
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,000
systems there I mean there I used to

737
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,159
joke to something like anyone even the

738
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,320
poorest peasant in the most remote

739
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,760
African village who has highspeed

740
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,679
internet and a basic understanding of

741
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,840
matrix algebra can take the introduction

742
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,960
aeronautics class. Um I was like yeah

743
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,440
there actually are not that many

744
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,159
peasants who have who meet both of those

745
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,640
criteria. Um but um u it it was always

746
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,400
the case there was a very famous case of

747
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
there was the article in the New York

748
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Times about him was called the boy

749
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,720
genius of Ulan Bar. Um so there was a

750
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,039
student who was in Mongolia um who got a

751
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,760
perfect score on the first MITx class

752
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,919
and was admitted to MIT. Um and and this

753
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,760
was sort of taken as proof that like

754
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,080
anybody anywhere in the world can get

755
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,520
access to our courses and we're going to

756
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
be able to find the you know the best

757
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,559
high school students and bring them to

758
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,720
MIT. Well, there are some more details

759
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,960
to the story. One is the principal of

760
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,159
that school in Mongolia is as I

761
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,600
understood at the time the only person

762
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,360
from Mongolia to have graduated from

763
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,600
MIT. Um so there was kind of a

764
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,600
connection there. Second, um there was

765
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,440
like a an advanced physics class that

766
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
was offered that used the material, but

767
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,799
there was a posttock who I think was at

768
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Stanford or Cal some elite school in

769
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,200
California who went and like studied

770
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,520
with these kids um for a bunch of

771
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
months. Um so one thing you could say is

772
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,880
like oh we just need to get muks into

773
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,000
every school and then we'll help people

774
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,760
find their way to MIT. The other thing

775
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,520
you say is like we just need MIT grads

776
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,880
being the principal of every school um

777
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
and then we can get people coming to

778
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
MIT. But this kid, his name was Batouch.

779
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,240
Any he did a bunch of education classes

780
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,679
in MIT. He was a remarkable kid. Um, he

781
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,200
used to watch two videos at the same

782
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,240
time when he was doing these classes.

783
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,840
Um, it doesn't make any sense, but

784
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
there's a great news article that shows

785
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,120
his little setup of him watching two

786
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,600
videos at the same time. I He's clearly

787
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,279
a smart guy. Um, but it was really

788
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,760
important to the narrative of MOOs. Um,

789
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,600
that uh look look at look at how far

790
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,679
into the periphery that we've reached to

791
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,120
sort of bring people into the core. um

792
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,120
you know and so folks like me who are

793
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,559
writing papers are like I'm not like

794
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,200
that is that is neat that is a true

795
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:57,039
story is an awesome kid that is not

796
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,200
representative of the of the broader

797
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,080
system that we've built here um and uh

798
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,240
yeah you know people really want it was

799
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,039
interesting people really wanted these

800
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,000
things to be democratizing

801
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,440
education but then when it was pretty

802
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,360
obvious they weren't they were still

803
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,600
like yeah well okay we'll just use them

804
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,520
anyway um I I I know I helped support uh

805
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,840
um I did an evaluation of the supply

806
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,799
chain management program which was one

807
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,880
of the first programs that said um do

808
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,760
half the program online. So you have to

809
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
take and pass sort of proctored tests in

810
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,760
four or five online classes and then

811
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,200
we'll give you half a degree credit and

812
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
you come to campus and finish the other

813
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,000
half of the degree. Um and uh it was

814
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,520
kind of you know um there are a lot of

815
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,279
good things about it actually. So, one

816
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,720
is supply chain management is a

817
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,000
relatively new field and so there aren't

818
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,679
a lot of universities around the world

819
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,960
that offer it and MIT is pretty good at

820
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,440
it. So, this was a good way of like

821
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,880
having more people be able to do it. Um,

822
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,399
it's a relatively small program. They

823
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,840
don't have a ton of faculty. So, you get

824
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,600
twice as in theory you could have twice

825
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,120
as many people come through campus if

826
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,480
they do half the stuff online and half

827
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,960
the stuff here. And there were actually

828
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,200
some really cool findings where the

829
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,279
folks who the f the way they did it is

830
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,960
they kept an an in-person cohort and

831
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,720
added a a uh an online cohort that

832
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,360
showed up with the inperson cohort in

833
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,000
January. Um, and we did some surveys

834
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,760
about how both groups felt in terms of

835
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,279
their connection to MIT. And they both

836
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,399
felt really strongly connected to MIT.

837
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,559
Actually, in sort of funny ways, like

838
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,000
the on-ampus people were like, we've

839
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,760
been here all year, like this is our

840
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,120
place. And the online people were like,

841
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,880
we've been taking these classes together

842
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,240
for three years. Like, this is our

843
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,760
place. So, they both felt really

844
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
connected in interesting kind of ways.

845
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,120
Um, the grades of the online folks were

846
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,399
actually slightly better um at the end

847
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,399
of the first cohort, although who knows

848
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,440
if that would have persisted um into

849
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,080
time. Um but the uh the only people who

850
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,760
persisted through the online courses

851
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,200
were people who already had jobs in

852
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,480
logistics industries were getting their

853
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
second degree were already affluent.

854
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,760
They're disproportionately guys. Um

855
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,760
there's a whole line of research that

856
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,200
really focuses on um people's ability to

857
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,120
conduct self-regulated learning,

858
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,799
people's ability to sort of like persist

859
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,480
through difficulty and and things like

860
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,080
that. And so you talk to learners and

861
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,520
they would talk about how they, you

862
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,120
know, took their lunch breaks and they

863
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,559
studied, how they took weekends and

864
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,080
studied, how they stayed up late at

865
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,760
night and they studied and p, you know,

866
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,360
and in especially if you think about it

867
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,720
through like an individual sort of

868
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,840
psychological perspective, you're like,

869
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,279
"Yeah, those are all great qualities."

870
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,399
Um, another thing we realize though is

871
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,480
like like if you're studying like in the

872
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,720
evenings, you're probably sherking

873
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,080
family responsibilities. Um, and in lots

874
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,520
of cultures across the world, it is way

875
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,880
easier for guys to sherk family

876
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,159
responsibilities than it is for women to

877
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,000
sherk family responsibilities. So, in

878
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,840
some in some ways, like self-regulated

879
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,279
learning was the same thing as sherking

880
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,640
family responsibility. Like the thing

881
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,159
that you'd study from a psychological

882
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,039
perspective as self-regulated learning

883
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,640
would be sherking family

884
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,520
responsibilities from a sociological

885
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,159
point of view. Um, and so again, just

886
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,399
giving us more ways to think about as we

887
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,159
create learning environments, who will

888
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,600
benefit from them, what are the enabling

889
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,799
conditions to help lots of people from

890
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,480
lots of different kinds of backgrounds

891
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,600
and places in society be able to benefit

892
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,039
from them, things like that. Um,

893
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,200
uh, I think something that stood out to

894
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,360
me was their business model of the mix.

895
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,919
I think I don't like really understand

896
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,679
it because I think for me as someone who

897
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,840
went to international school in Africa

898
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,760
and I would say it's what maybe like top

899
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,840
five like in my country or something and

900
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,760
pretty big like in Africa like I've

901
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,679
never heard of any like MIT or Harvard

902
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,279
course like in my life. I'd probably say

903
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,240
none of my teachers have heard about it.

904
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,080
And I think it made me wonder like who

905
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
exactly like they're targeting because I

906
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,080
don't think it's necessarily like young

907
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,159
high schoolers like trying to like get

908
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,399
into college because what I did realize

909
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,000
when I MIT and when I Googled like how

910
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,559
to do linear algebra or like all these

911
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,320
things is then I would see like MIT

912
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,799
courses and MIT open courseware and all

913
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,080
these things pop up on YouTube. But then

914
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,360
back in high school when I didn't know

915
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
what like linear algebra if you don't

916
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,840
know what linear algebra was, how are

917
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,360
you going to search for a linear algebra

918
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,279
course? Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a that's

919
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,519
a terrific example. I mean, the business

920
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,120
model, I mean, Daffhne Coller and I

921
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,720
think in one of her first talks refers

922
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,120
to it as a blue ocean business model,

923
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,279
which is basically, you know, the the

924
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,320
potential addressable market is like six

925
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,279
billion people in the world or

926
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,880
something. You know, anybody who has got

927
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,600
an internet connection, if you, you

928
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,279
know, if you can sell $35 certificates a

929
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,559
couple of times, you know, to six

930
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,799
billion people over and over again, you

931
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,559
can make a lot of money doing that. um

932
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,480
the um and there were efforts to try to

933
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,320
you like create institutional

934
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,320
connections. So like CS50, who's

935
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,480
Harvard's computer science class, has a

936
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,120
whole program to help high schools adopt

937
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,799
CS50, like to adopt the online CS50

938
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,519
materials in their in-person

939
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,279
instruction. Um so there's some fraction

940
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,399
that you, you know, hanging out in

941
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,120
Africa would have encountered this

942
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,120
course and just decided to take it. Um

943
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
there's some sense that your school

944
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,640
might have like made you know connected

945
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,480
with one of these sort of formalist.

946
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,519
There was another great story of uh the

947
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,880
guy who founded Stripe was from St.

948
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,320
Louis um and uh was like I want to live

949
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,519
in St. Louis and he's like I can't hire

950
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,559
any developers in St. Louis. There

951
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,600
aren't enough developer. I'm pretty sure

952
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,919
it was St. Louis. I might have the town

953
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,200
wrong. Um so so when Mukes came out he

954
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,519
was like oh let's just offer let's offer

955
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,600
CS50 in St. Louis and we'll start like

956
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,600
building infrastructure for this. and

957
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,840
like they started some pilot program and

958
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,200
it like completely filled the library.

959
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,799
Um you know there just hundreds of

960
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,159
people who like with a little additional

961
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,080
support. So they ended they ended up

962
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,919
like creating a community space for it.

963
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,919
So you use the online materials that

964
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,519
that was I think there were models like

965
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,840
that to try to bridge the gap that

966
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,880
you're describing um that it's not

967
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,480
realistic to just you know like have

968
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,840
kids encountered these classes and

969
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,480
decided to get excited about them and

970
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,000
things like that. still um almost all of

971
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,760
those intermediate bridging layers

972
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,600
require human capital and humans are

973
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,240
super expensive and then you sort of

974
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,720
erase the kind of financial advantages

975
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,000
of uh um that the muks were sort of

976
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
promoting in the beginning. Lots of

977
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,120
online programs have found this like

978
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,360
it's pretty cheap to offer online

979
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,960
classes um but a lot of times people

980
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,080
just drop out of them. if you want them

981
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,320
to not drop out of them, you have to

982
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,760
hire coaches and adviserss and, you

983
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,120
know, assistant instructors and things

984
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,320
like that. And then you've just ra, you

985
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,720
know, you sort of brought back all the

986
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,119
costs that you got rid of from teaching.

987
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,919
Um, is there like a statistic on how

988
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,040
often state universities create mukes

989
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,599
versus like

990
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,679
these IVS schools? Because the thought

991
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
occurs to me that maybe the reason why

992
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,000
it doesn't matter if like Harvard or MIT

993
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,839
or Stanford puts out a MOO is because

994
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,240
you're not coming to Harvard or MIT or

995
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,320
Stanford just for the information. Yeah.

996
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,599
Because obviously what's associated with

997
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,599
that is kind of like this title and this

998
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,679
class ratification thing that isn't

999
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,760
accessible through a MOO. So it doesn't

1000
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,599
matter if like the entire world has

1001
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,599
access to a course that's meant for

1002
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,159
learning because part of what you pay

1003
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,320
for and part of the real target audience

1004
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,159
of these universities is people who want

1005
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,839
the the title associated well there

1006
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,919
there's a economist at Stanford who

1007
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,119
wrote kind of a cool paper that says the

1008
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,200
way you have to understand elite

1009
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,000
education funding models is that they

1010
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,960
like roughly offer their education for

1011
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,359
free in the hopes of having a very small

1012
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,800
percentage of people pay very large

1013
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,680
amounts of money for their education

1014
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,920
later. Um, like basically we we

1015
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,839
subsidize people's tuition in all kinds

1016
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,520
of ways. So we at least we subs even if

1017
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,680
your tuition feels really high, your

1018
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,440
tuition is subsidized far beyond what it

1019
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,599
actually costs to educate you. And then

1020
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,839
hopefully 1% of you will give tens of

1021
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,520
millions of dollars back to MIT later.

1022
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,599
And so this person was trying to sort of

1023
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,119
think about like what you know how like

1024
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,079
given that's actually how elite

1025
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,680
universities are funded um why do you

1026
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,880
know like what effect will muks have on

1027
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,520
those kinds of relationships? But there

1028
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,960
were plenty of public institutions. Um,

1029
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,240
uh, one re, you know, one reason that

1030
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,240
public institutions got really excited

1031
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,839
about it is their job is to serve as

1032
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,119
many people in the state as possible.

1033
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,280
Um, and if you're in a big, you know,

1034
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,119
you're in a geographically large state

1035
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,400
like Virginia and you're the University

1036
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,920
of Virginia in the middle of it, like

1037
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,960
it's pretty hard to help people in the

1038
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,800
Tidewater, um, and in the southwest area

1039
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,200
and in the DC area and other things like

1040
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,720
that. Um, so, you know, Michigan made

1041
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,720
big investments, Texas made big

1042
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,720
investments. Um there there were lots of

1043
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,720
flagship public schools um that uh um

1044
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,320
probably the most distinctive one maybe

1045
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,720
not in MOUS but just in online learning

1046
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,160
generally is Arizona State University um

1047
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,560
which has really transformed itself

1048
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,560
through online learning into a global

1049
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,400
institution which they really see as

1050
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,000
like as missiondriven like how how do we

1051
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,000
just have as many people as possible in

1052
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,160
Arizona beyond Arizona get access to the

1053
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,599
learning opportunities we create. Um and

1054
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,680
there there's something very noble that

1055
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,760
I that I find about that. Um, I wanted

1056
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,599
to follow up on your first question um

1057
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,599
about the business model. How have

1058
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,160
for-profit universities sort of reacted

1059
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,000
to MOUS um since their entire model is

1060
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,760
trying to serve as many underserved

1061
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,560
people as possible and just like

1062
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,160
charging them a lot and the fact is that

1063
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,760
a lot of them are also online. Yeah.

1064
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,040
Like the University of Phoenix, I think.

1065
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,320
Yeah. University of Phoenix, Kaplan, um,

1066
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,760
uh, uh, Southern New Hampshire

1067
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,520
University, Western Governor's

1068
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,440
University. I mean, I think there were

1069
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,320
some like Southern New Hampshire

1070
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,640
University would have really

1071
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,960
welcomed in in some of their reactions

1072
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,480
were like, "Hey team, this is not new."

1073
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,640
Like this is exactly what we've been

1074
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
doing for decades. So, so a weird thing

1075
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,960
was that there was a status flip in

1076
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,520
online learning. In 2010, online

1077
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
learning was a very low status activity.

1078
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,400
um it would have been primarily

1079
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,000
conducted community colleges, for-profit

1080
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,760
colleges, state colleges and overnight

1081
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,560
instantly Stanford, MIT and Harvard made

1082
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,920
it an elite activity. Um they instantly

1083
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,720
radic there's actually all kinds of

1084
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,680
sociological theory about this where um

1085
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,520
the the middle class people have to sort

1086
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,880
of like avoid the activities of lowerass

1087
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,160
people and pursue the activities of

1088
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,000
upper class people and lower class

1089
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,359
people pursue the activity of people but

1090
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,119
upper class people can actually pursue

1091
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,880
the activities of lowerass people

1092
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,400
because their status is safe. Like every

1093
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,760
once in a while though trends come along

1094
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,160
of people who like dress like trash or

1095
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,240
you know sort of like um you know other

1096
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
kinds of kinds of you know adopting

1097
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,359
adopting sort of lower class activity.

1098
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,240
So there's some sociological theory that

1099
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,079
sort of is behind some of that. Um but

1100
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,920
it was a hu it was it was one of the

1101
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,119
things that was sort of striking about

1102
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,720
that moment. So a bunch of these

1103
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,000
universities were like give me a break.

1104
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,599
We've been doing this forever. I I gave

1105
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,359
a talk at Oakland University, which is

1106
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,359
kind of a community college in Michigan,

1107
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,160
and they and they were like, you know,

1108
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,240
they'd be like, why are you using video

1109
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,359
like like text is so much better? Like

1110
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,119
we've been doing this for years. Like we

1111
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,800
would like lots of people can't download

1112
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,960
the video. Like bandwidth is not that

1113
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,119
good. And there's not really a benefit

1114
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
to watching someone say something versus

1115
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,320
reading what they would say. Like what

1116
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,040
are you all doing? And be like, you

1117
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
might have a point there. Um because cuz

1118
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,640
uh because they were doing something.

1119
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,640
But on the other hand, um if you're

1120
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,320
really fired up about online learning,

1121
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,000
um and Harvard and MIT and Stanford and

1122
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,480
John Hopkins in Michigan are like, "No,

1123
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,720
online learning is cool now." Um there's

1124
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,560
ways that you can use that to raise your

1125
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,320
status to legitimize your activities and

1126
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,000
other things like that. So, so existing

1127
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,960
players um there, you know, but and they

1128
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,960
weren't they weren't really

1129
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,720
pursuing similar kinds of markets for

1130
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,880
the most part. I mean, there's there

1131
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,960
were a handful of MOO efforts that tried

1132
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,520
to um help people earn bachelor's

1133
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,280
degrees, and they were mostly totally

1134
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,640
unsuccessful. Um, and there weren't even

1135
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,000
really that many of them were that were

1136
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,079
tried, which is that is kind of like the

1137
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,800
sweet spot of most, uh, for-profit

1138
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,560
colleges. Um, uh, which are, you know,

1139
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,920
which in which in many respects there's

1140
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,400
a lot of evidence that they're just a

1141
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,680
disaster for lots lots of people don't

1142
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
finish. People finish with a lot of

1143
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,839
debt. Um, Trese McMillan Cotm wrote a

1144
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
book called Lower Ed where she described

1145
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,599
them as a negative social insurance

1146
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,359
program. Um, where on average people are

1147
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,720
worse after finding their ways into them

1148
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,040
than they were beforehand. Her book

1149
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,320
Lower Ed is pretty fabulous. Um, all

1150
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,520
right, let's make sure that we get a

1151
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,640
chance to talk a little bit about part

1152
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,480
two. Um, which is algorithm guided

1153
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,960
learning at scale. So it sounds like a

1154
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,040
bunch of you this this we're heading

1155
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,680
into new territory for me which is like

1156
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,800
well how raise your hand if in your K12

1157
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,320
experience you did something that you

1158
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,680
think was algorithm guided learning at

1159
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,599
scale like you sat in front of thing

1160
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,280
okay this like this is by far the

1161
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,760
highest percentage that I've had in this

1162
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,560
class thus far so it's not so we're so

1163
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,640
so I think um it you know I don't know

1164
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,680
five years ago people like a handful of

1165
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,200
people would have done it or would done

1166
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,960
a little bit as a curiosity but like

1167
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,480
clearly if you all know what is and

1168
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,760
things like that like this is becoming a

1169
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,280
sort of much more mainstream activity um

1170
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,200
in uh in people's classes. What what did

1171
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,640
you what was your sense of them? Um so

1172
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,760
so Dana's sense was that they were like

1173
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,400
kind of pointless and she could just

1174
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,200
have her mom do them for her. Um what

1175
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,359
were what were other

1176
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,599
people's sentiments about them? Emily?

1177
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,920
Oh, I thought well for me like in high

1178
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,000
school we used this thing called me bean

1179
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,839
where it was like you take an assessment

1180
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,520
and it would kind of like rank you like

1181
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,240
where your reading and your vocap skills

1182
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,720
are at and then like you kind of log in

1183
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,440
every week to do it and like learn and

1184
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,240
progress I guess. And I thought it was

1185
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,839
like it was useful for us because like

1186
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,720
even though we had like regular classes

1187
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,040
or honors classes for English like

1188
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,680
within that class like everybody's vocab

1189
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,760
like was different varied a lot and it

1190
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,920
was like it was very hard for like the

1191
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,520
teachers to to figure out like what kind

1192
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,000
of vocabs to teach like what materials

1193
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,200
to provide for us cuz like everybody had

1194
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,800
different things and like a lot of times

1195
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,400
we were just in class like I know this

1196
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,240
word and like you just stop paying

1197
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,760
attention but then other kids are like

1198
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,680
well I have never heard this word. I

1199
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,640
hate to like learn it. For us, it was

1200
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,119
like it was cool, but then like one of

1201
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,280
my friend, she like assessed it and then

1202
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,560
she she was she started off in like

1203
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,400
highest like level ranking and then like

1204
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,839
after she finished they just bumped her

1205
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,280
back down to level one. So then like she

1206
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,720
just like went back to like learning

1207
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,319
like blue green in like high school and

1208
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,560
sophomore year. That sounds like a

1209
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,200
flawed system. Yeah. I will tell you

1210
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,119
that when I was in the fourth grade, we

1211
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,040
had a similar version of that. Um, they

1212
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,599
were called SRRI reading cards. It was a

1213
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,760
like a file box. Um, and it was a bunch

1214
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,520
of like short stories or non-fiction

1215
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,920
passages that were arranged in order of

1216
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,520
difficulty and you would just like go

1217
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,960
and read one and answer a bunch of

1218
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,400
questions about it and if you got them

1219
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,319
all right, you'd go on to the next one

1220
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,920
or a couple later and if you got them

1221
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,200
less well, then you like went back to

1222
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,040
earlier ones or your teacher helped you

1223
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,480
or something like that. Um, so there

1224
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,839
were so this this I mean it's something

1225
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,839
that will come up, but this notion that

1226
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,040
like oh what would it look like to like

1227
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,040
figure out what kinds of learning

1228
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,640
experiences people need in that moment

1229
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,400
and try to meet that need instead of

1230
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,480
teaching everybody the same thing at the

1231
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,440
same time um has been compelling for a

1232
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,119
long time. It sounds like it was

1233
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,960
compelling for you at least until the

1234
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,280
system sort of freaked out and made you

1235
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,200
learn kindergarten words again. Yeah, we

1236
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,280
had something with like reading as well,

1237
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,079
but I think one of the issues was we it

1238
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,640
was not nearly as consistent because

1239
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,240
like I mean it was meant to be done like

1240
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,160
once a week or twice a week like a lot

1241
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,000
of the examples we saw in class but like

1242
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,880
it'd be like oh like whenever the

1243
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,720
teacher like didn't want to deal with

1244
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,040
kind of like bring in the car and like

1245
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,520
okay do this. So, it was so inconsistent

1246
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,520
that I was like, "Okay, well, like I

1247
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,520
don't exactly know if I'm improving or

1248
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,280
I'm staying stagnant because like I

1249
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,800
haven't seen this program for two weeks

1250
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,240
now." Good. You said two things there

1251
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,040
that I really want you to hang up hang

1252
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,960
on to. Um, one is you said something

1253
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,720
which Larry Cuban would have said about

1254
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,560
television things or things like that,

1255
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,640
which is that the designers of this

1256
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,920
program have a vision, but the teachers

1257
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
have a different set of needs. So, the

1258
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,880
teachers are like, "I need to do some

1259
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,000
grading today or I don't feel well.

1260
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,119
We're going to do this thing." which

1261
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,400
which would have been the exact same

1262
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,319
thing as like rolling into television

1263
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,440
and putting on a a movie for people to

1264
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,359
watch. Um and also um that these systems

1265
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,160
have some kind of pedagogical model

1266
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,920
behind them and their effectiveness may

1267
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,720
have to do with how well that

1268
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,720
pedagogical model is implemented. Um, so

1269
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,400
if people so if a if a system is

1270
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,400
designed to be used with some

1271
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,240
consistency, you know, twice a week in

1272
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,200
six week chunks or something like that

1273
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,440
and you don't use it with it with with

1274
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,640
that that program design in mind, it

1275
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,480
might not accomplish what you wanted to

1276
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,160
do. So it's not just a matter of like

1277
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,240
downloading the software onto kids

1278
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,920
computers. Um, it's a matter of getting

1279
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,359
whole systems to implement them. We're

1280
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,119
going to look at some research I'll show

1281
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,240
you on uh on Monday. I don't know if

1282
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,319
I'll make you read it, but I think I'll

1283
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,839
just summarize it for you. Um about some

1284
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,680
of these intelligent tutors that are

1285
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,520
really focused on um letting people work

1286
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,760
on problems that are challenging for

1287
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,200
them, even if it's from material that is

1288
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,240
from earlier in the year, previous

1289
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,160
years. Um and that system only works if

1290
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,079
teachers actually let their students do

1291
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,839
that. Um if teachers force their

1292
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,960
students along sort of against the will

1293
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,640
of the system, then the system doesn't

1294
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,720
do what it's supposed to do.

1295
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,720
I think like I guess like elaborate a

1296
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,800
little bit why on like my experience was

1297
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,640
the way it was was like not only were

1298
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,319
teachers like your experience just like

1299
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,160
doing it randomly like they weren't

1300
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,839
incorporating it into like their

1301
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,319
curriculum like they were just like

1302
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,160
slapping it on top of it and like when

1303
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,760
students already overwhelmed with like

1304
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,000
after school activities and things like

1305
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,319
that it then like and it was like more

1306
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,960
of a math based thing than an English

1307
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,440
where like you kind of see some of like

1308
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,280
the benefits early on. Um, so it was

1309
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,640
like just kind of thrown in there but

1310
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,240
not incorporated in the curriculum and

1311
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,079
then it's just like essentially became

1312
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,160
low priority and like for a lot of

1313
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,480
people. So if a so if a system so if a

1314
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,680
system it like depends on some hybridity

1315
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,880
if it depends on some things that are

1316
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,160
happening in class and some things are

1317
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,160
happening online like if those two

1318
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,280
pieces are not fitting together it's not

1319
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,200
going to accomplish what the system

1320
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,560
wants to accomplish. Um, all right. I'll

1321
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,480
give you a funny little piece a little

1322
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,760
personal piece that is behind some of

1323
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,319
the technology. I explained some of this

1324
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
a little bit. Um, but my father has more

1325
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,280
or less done one cool thing in his life.

1326
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,720
Um, which was to which was to get a fake

1327
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,880
person into Princeton. Um, he he uh he

1328
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:43,680
and his frat buddies um invented a

1329
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:49,200
person named uh uh J. David Osnot. Um or

1330
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:51,200
Joe Dnot or Joe does not um and uh they

1331
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,280
like found a friend of theirs to take

1332
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,359
the SAT for him. They found some friends

1333
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,599
at a frat house in Michigan to make up a

1334
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,599
fake transcript. They got one of them to

1335
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,440
go and do an interview and things like

1336
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,400
that. And they got this fake guy into

1337
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,280
Princeton. Um, and they eventually had

1338
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,000
to admit it. Um, and it's and uh at some

1339
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,640
point somebody was taking one of them to

1340
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,640
uh um to the admissions office to go

1341
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,000
explain to the admissions officer that

1342
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,760
they had gotten a fake person into

1343
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,119
Princeton. And this guy started asking

1344
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,599
them a whole bunch of questions about

1345
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,359
how they took the SAT. Um, and it turned

1346
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,440
out this guy worked for Educational

1347
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,280
Testing Services, which was also um in

1348
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,560
Princeton, New Jersey, and was trying to

1349
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,160
figure out some of the sort of test

1350
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,960
security things that were going on

1351
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,640
there. Um, so as I mentioned last time,

1352
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,200
one of the things about one of the ways

1353
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,520
that you can make tests more secure, um,

1354
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,119
is that you can make it so that tests

1355
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,000
are of equal difficulty, but they use

1356
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:47,200
different questions. Um, so, uh, you

1357
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,720
know, the the students in Boston are not

1358
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,800
taking the exact same test that students

1359
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,240
in Hawaii will take six hours later or

1360
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,359
students in other parts of the world or

1361
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,240
things like that. In order to be able to

1362
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,240
do that, you have to be able to um

1363
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,160
create a mathematical representation for

1364
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,119
any given item of how difficult that

1365
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,880
item is. Um, what people basically

1366
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,200
decided to do to um to solve that is to

1367
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,960
model the difficulty of items as

1368
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,400
logistic functions. Um so on the x- axis

1369
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,560
you have this thing which is sort of a

1370
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,960
proficiency score like roughly kind of

1371
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,200
how hard in any domain this would be. Um

1372
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,200
and then the probability of a correct

1373
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,920
answer. So these are sort of three

1374
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,440
different possible distributions of

1375
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,440
items. Um so for instance um which of

1376
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,720
these items would be more difficult

1377
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,319
would be the most difficult for

1378
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,319
individuals with proficiency score of

1379
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,319
one.

1380
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,920
So people on the blue have almost 100%

1381
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,000
probability of getting this one correct.

1382
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,160
So it'll be the green one. Um so this is

1383
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,960
the probability answer get. So for um

1384
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,480
for this particular item um people with

1385
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,920
a proficiency of one are about 50%

1386
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,560
likely to get it right. These are the

1387
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,560
people who are about um you know 90% to

1388
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,640
get it right almost exactly likely to

1389
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,839
get it right. Um so that seems like a

1390
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,599
useful thing to know about an item,

1391
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,200
right? Um now you can figure out like oh

1392
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,560
let's give them the the blue item first

1393
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,440
and then the red item and then the green

1394
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,000
item or something like that. Um um not

1395
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,359
only that, but if you model it this way,

1396
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,800
you can also figure out how

1397
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:23,599
discriminating an item is. um which is

1398
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,720
how likely is it that people around a

1399
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,800
given proficiency are are likely to get

1400
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,400
it wrong or not get it wrong like sort

1401
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,240
of how um how how tightly clustered are

1402
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,160
the answers versus be or how spread out

1403
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,319
are the answers going to be. Um uh so

1404
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,119
you know wherever you see you know a a

1405
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,680
around one um you would imagine for this

1406
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,359
one um that like a whole bunch of people

1407
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,920
with scores sort of slightly less than

1408
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,200
one um would do would be would be less

1409
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,400
likely to get right and then more likely

1410
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,119
to get it right. Where sort of around

1411
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,119
here because the lines are are um more

1412
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,240
horizontal there um just about everybody

1413
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,200
who gets those items are going to be

1414
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,200
right. So it's not going to give you

1415
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,640
that much information um about uh about

1416
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,880
how well people do. Another way that you

1417
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,400
could do this is like draw a

1418
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,119
distribution of where you think a group

1419
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,280
of learners would be. Um, you know, so

1420
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,119
this is like the various skill levels in

1421
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,400
a class and the sort of distribution of

1422
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,400
probabilities of people getting it

1423
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,960
right. Um, and you can see that like the

1424
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,880
item that sort of like traverses through

1425
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,559
the heart of that group is going to be

1426
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,720
the one that's best at like efficiently

1427
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,880
measuring the proficiency of that group.

1428
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,240
Um, you don't have to totally understand

1429
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,599
all the math or all the ideas about

1430
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,400
this. probably like the intuition that

1431
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,680
you need to develop is in the 1980s a

1432
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,599
bunch of people came up with like a

1433
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,359
pretty good statistical toolkit for

1434
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,599
figuring out how difficult an item was.

1435
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,160
Um the first thing that they did with it

1436
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,000
was make different kinds of tests um for

1437
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,599
sort of test security purposes. But

1438
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
almost the next thing they did with it

1439
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,079
was start developing systems that use

1440
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,920
computers to evaluate people's

1441
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,839
performance on an item and then figure

1442
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,119
out like what is the next good item to

1443
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,960
give them in a sequence and all the

1444
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,880
things that you're describing Khan

1445
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,800
Academy all other things like that. Um

1446
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,400
they may not use this exact statistical

1447
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,000
toolkit but they all use something

1448
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,480
that's sort of similar um to

1449
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,079
that. The reason um you know and one one

1450
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,440
piece I mean part of the reason why in

1451
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,200
the book that I take a couple of pages

1452
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,880
to describe item response theory to

1453
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,520
people is again to try to give the sense

1454
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,160
like it's not magic um it's not like

1455
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,960
some impossibly difficult thing um that

1456
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,800
that computers and scientists like on

1457
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,640
the very cutting edge of mathematics

1458
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,960
have figured out like this is like a

1459
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,520
pretty wellestablished set of tools that

1460
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,839
we've studied for a long time um if

1461
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,680
people come up with new AI powered

1462
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,280
intelligent tutors we should absolely

1463
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,720
absolutely be able to ask the question

1464
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,000
like, well, how are they really

1465
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,400
different from the intelligent tutors

1466
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,160
that we've had um for decades in various

1467
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,119
formats? How how different are they from

1468
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,880
the box of SRR(I) reading cards um that

1469
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,319
I had when I was in the fourth grade?"

1470
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,440
And there may be some ways that that

1471
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,960
they're different, in which case we

1472
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,079
would expect much better outcomes. There

1473
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,079
may be some ways that they're quite

1474
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,000
similar um in which case we might not

1475
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:05,119
expect that many differences. Um but the

1476
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,559
the heart of the reason why people

1477
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,240
wanted these kinds of tools to exist was

1478
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,160
personalization. Um that that there was

1479
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,480
that that that a goal that you can get a

1480
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,640
lot of people around is the idea that

1481
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,200
wouldn't it be great if every learner

1482
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,720
could have an experience that's tailored

1483
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,480
um to their to their own personal needs

1484
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,640
and interests and experiences and things

1485
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,079
like that. Um I noticed I don't know

1486
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,520
around 2008 2009 2010 that lots of

1487
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,359
people in education got interested in

1488
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,040
personalization. A thing that was weird

1489
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,520
to me is that there were people who are

1490
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,319
interested in personalization who

1491
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,520
disagreed about everything else. Um so

1492
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,040
there would be people who are like

1493
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,359
really into um school choice and

1494
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,680
traditional instruction and sort of like

1495
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,520
conservative curriculum values who are

1496
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,280
you know um who like typically were more

1497
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,280
associated with people on the political

1498
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,319
right though not always in America um

1499
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,240
who got really interested in

1500
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:00,240
personalization. There were also people

1501
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,760
who were who were educational

1502
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,160
progressives who were really interested

1503
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,160
in alternate projectbased school kinds

1504
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,160
of models. They also were talking about

1505
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,559
personalization. Um, and I thought to

1506
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,119
myself, okay, um, if these groups who

1507
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,880
don't agree about anything, um, are all

1508
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,040
using the word personalization, they

1509
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,240
can't possibly mean the same thing. Um,

1510
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,920
because they have really different

1511
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,839
values and so they probably don't agree

1512
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,000
about this either. Um, oh, this was a

1513
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,839
slide that my colleague, uh, Dan Meyer

1514
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,480
put together of this is some technology

1515
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:31,119
from the 1970s. Um, you know, right at

1516
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,559
the dawn of personal computers where we

1517
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,319
were trying to like give kids math

1518
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,400
problems, evaluate them, give them

1519
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,160
harder problems. This is a slide from

1520
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,079
2012. But the thing that you can see is

1521
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,280
like there's 40 years between these

1522
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,760
pictures um and they are strikingly

1523
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,599
similar um in their setup and their

1524
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,040
outfit. Like this is a this is one of

1525
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:51,440
the longest you know trying to

1526
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,400
personalize education with computers is

1527
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,400
one of the oldest enterprises in

1528
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,079
educational computing. It is one of the

1529
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,599
main things that we've been trying to do

1530
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:04,800
for 40 or 50 years.

1531
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:08,400
Um if there is any single paper that got

1532
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,800
people extremely excited about this um

1533
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,319
it was called the two sigma problem the

1534
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,640
search for methods of group instruction

1535
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,079
as effective as onetoone tutoring um

1536
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,480
where this guy Benjamin any of you ever

1537
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,680
heard of Bloom's taxonomy

1538
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,640
um it's this uh little pyramid that has

1539
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,920
sort of different kinds of uh um

1540
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,200
learning activities instructional

1541
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,720
activities you could do. Turns out that

1542
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,240
Benjamin Bloom did more than one thing

1543
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,520
in his life. He didn't just make this

1544
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,040
taxonomy, but he did other kind of

1545
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,640
studies. He didn't actually do these

1546
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,559
studies. He was reporting on some

1547
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,720
doctoral students of his um that um were

1548
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,559
studying tutoring. And in these tutoring

1549
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,960
studies that they did, you just get like

1550
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,079
astronomically good results. Um they,

1551
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,400
you know, they said that they could get

1552
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,480
results two standard deviations better

1553
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,880
um than what uh what you typically find.

1554
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,319
That's the two sigma problem. um a two

1555
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,520
standard deviation improvement in

1556
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,079
education is is impossibly good. Um most

1557
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,680
of the things that we do um get a tenth

1558
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,200
of a standard deviation or a hundredth

1559
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,240
of a standard deviation improvement or

1560
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,520
something like that. We usually get

1561
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,720
really small gains, but tutoring works

1562
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,079
really well. I mean to some extent you

1563
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,240
could be like I'm pretty sure like

1564
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,400
medieval lords knew that tutoring works

1565
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,319
pretty well. Um the reason why we don't

1566
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,040
do it is it's enormously expensive. But

1567
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,680
what if instead of medieval lords hiring

1568
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,839
governnesses to tutor their students um

1569
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,040
like what if computers could do that? um

1570
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,920
what if what if what if you know

1571
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,599
computers which are relatively

1572
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,119
inexpensive um could do this kind of

1573
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,559
tutoring. So this has been a dream. This

1574
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,240
was you know Daffhne College dream,

1575
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,400
Scon's dream, lots of other people's

1576
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,640
dream as they're imagining um sort of

1577
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,800
what's possible here. Um there were

1578
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,680
around 2010 there were probably two

1579
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,440
different groups of people who describe

1580
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,119
person who who made personalized

1581
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,000
learning sort of central to their ideas

1582
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,960
and their philosophies. Um, one group of

1583
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,800
people were really interested in what

1584
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,480
they call blended learning. A formal

1585
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,079
educational program in which a student

1586
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,160
learns at least in part through online

1587
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,119
delivery with some element of student

1588
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,920
control over time, play, place, path or

1589
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,319
pace. Um, some of it may be supervised

1590
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,839
uh and then and then some of it at home.

1591
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:09,680
Um, the alternative view was called

1592
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,359
connected learning. Socially embedded,

1593
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,640
interest driven, oriented towards

1594
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,000
educational, economic, political

1595
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,599
opportunity. Connected learning is

1596
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,400
realized when a person is able to pursue

1597
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,480
a personal interest or passion with the

1598
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,960
support of friends and caring adults.

1599
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:27,079
Um, so what what do these what else do

1600
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,079
these two ideas sound like?

1601
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,559
Yeah. Yeah. Good. So, so you could have

1602
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,680
said cognitive load theory and situated

1603
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,720
learning. You could have said Dian

1604
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,040
Thordike. You could have said

1605
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,960
instructionism and constructionism. Um,

1606
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,640
this is like the reoccurrence of these

1607
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,720
two themes over there. like there's

1608
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,920
always two ideas um and they're and

1609
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,800
they're always being reformatted and

1610
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,559
they're always getting connect with each

1611
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,000
other. So this is like the the Dewey and

1612
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,440
Thike version of how we're going to make

1613
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,520
personalization come to life in the

1614
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,760
world. Um we'll talk more about

1615
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,119
connected learning in a week. Um but

1616
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,760
mostly what we'll talk about today is

1617
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,359
what this blended learning um might look

1618
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,079
like. So one Khan Academy doesn't have

1619
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:09,040
this anymore. Um but they used to

1620
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,119
represent um their mathematics content

1621
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,240
in K through2 as a knowledge map as kind

1622
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,640
of a galaxy. Um one of the things that

1623
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,880
this blended learning version of

1624
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,319
personalization requires is you have to

1625
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,559
know all of the stuff that you want

1626
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,240
people to learn in advance. So if you

1627
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,720
want to create an algorithmically

1628
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,319
optimized pathway for people through a

1629
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,000
set of learning materials, you have to

1630
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,079
know what that what those learning

1631
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,599
materials are so that you can write the

1632
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,280
algorithms that drive them through it.

1633
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,040
Um that's very different from this

1634
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,079
connected learning view which says we

1635
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,680
should figure out what kids are really

1636
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,440
interested in and help them create

1637
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,920
personal pathways through whatever it is

1638
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,000
they want. Um you know so you could

1639
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,240
imagine that the goal of Khan Academy is

1640
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,160
to take some individual kid and figure

1641
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,319
out the fastest most efficient way for

1642
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,240
them to traverse pathways um through

1643
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,440
this kind of thing. People were were

1644
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,280
very compelled by that model. Um

1645
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,359
partially you know it's interesting they

1646
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,359
were sort of contrasting it. Um, a lot

1647
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,880
of time people will will sort of

1648
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,119
critique what they call the factory

1649
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,799
model of schooling. Um, which is that

1650
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,400
like students come in in cohorts,

1651
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,839
they're sort of stamped at the same

1652
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,440
time, they're move through the same

1653
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,920
materials despite all their individual

1654
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,040
differences. It's not really true. Um,

1655
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,799
but there are a lot of folks who will

1656
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,880
say that schools were sort of organized

1657
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,400
around factories in order to generate

1658
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,400
factory laborers and things like that.

1659
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,160
And there are certainly ideas um about

1660
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,000
how we use time and other kinds of

1661
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,599
things like that um that go across

1662
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,799
institutions and society. This is this

1663
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,520
is a representation from a keynote um oh

1664
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:39,440
sir Ken I'm forgetting he has he's the

1665
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,119
most popular keynote on uh uh on TED um

1666
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,200
the most po I still think it's true the

1667
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,880
most popular TED talk um that was ever

1668
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,200
written somebody will have to look up

1669
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Ken and figure out who I mean by this um

1670
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,319
but uh I don't know if this is actually

1671
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,799
from that or sort of a follow-up

1672
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:56,079
representation of slide um so then the

1673
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,160
question is like um does the does per

1674
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,480
does this sort of blended learning model

1675
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,920
have a kind of like truly individualized

1676
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,920
thing or are you just kind of like

1677
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,240
stamping each child with the same stuff

1678
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,359
in their own rate? Um like they all you

1679
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,040
know they all still are going to get

1680
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,240
kind of stamped with these materials but

1681
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,720
maybe they'll get stamped through the

1682
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:16,559
factory um at their own individual path.

1683
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:21,280
Um Ken Robinson Ken Robbins um Robinson

1684
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:23,680
Sir Ken Robinson the uh people make all

1685
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,520
kinds of crazy claims about these

1686
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,400
systems and sometimes I like to share

1687
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,680
these crazy claims 10 years later um

1688
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,240
because they sound sort of silly

1689
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,520
afterwards. So in 2009 um Klay

1690
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,599
Christensen who was one of the people

1691
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,040
who who defined blended learning wrote

1692
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,400
this book called disrupting class. Do

1693
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,680
you in the business school do you does

1694
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,839
do you study still the theory of

1695
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,400
disruptive innovation? like is that a

1696
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,760
thing that was like crazy popular a

1697
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,599
while ago and I think it has sort of

1698
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,720
faded but um they applied this idea

1699
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,640
called the theory of disruptive

1700
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,839
innovation and they said in 2009 they

1701
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,760
made the prediction um that by 2019 50%

1702
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,440
of all grade 6 through 12 courses would

1703
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,520
be online that they would cost a third

1704
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,599
as much to deliver um that your school

1705
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,599
system would cost like about as third as

1706
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,640
much to operate as it does right now and

1707
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,720
they would have better learning

1708
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,200
outcomes. Um, how many of you were in a

1709
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,839
school where 50% of all of your classes

1710
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,839
in secondary school were online or

1711
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,680
predominantly online? Yeah, zero. Pretty

1712
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,839
much didn't work out that way. Um,

1713
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:21,119
Sebastian Thrun, the the quote that Dana

1714
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:23,440
saw was up there. Um, Salan had an

1715
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,000
extremely popular TED talk called Let's

1716
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,559
Use Video to Reinvent Education where he

1717
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,680
sort of described this vision um where

1718
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,599
kids would sit down in front of

1719
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,520
individual terminals. They would learn

1720
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,280
at an algorithmically optimized rate

1721
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,880
through mathematics content. They still

1722
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,319
might do things together like a teacher

1723
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,680
might come and collect students who are

1724
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,520
stuck in the same thing and remediate

1725
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,119
them together or take advanced students

1726
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,200
and do projects with them or things like

1727
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,839
that but the heart of their mathematical

1728
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,160
learning would be individual. Um there's

1729
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:53,040
one guy who's actually I think probably

1730
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,599
the most wrong of them um who won the

1731
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,000
2013 TED prize. He got a million dollars

1732
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,319
um for this idea that uh you don't even

1733
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
need schools or educational systems. If

1734
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:05,200
you just give kids laptops they can

1735
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,640
teach anything by themselves. Um and uh

1736
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,079
he had this whole program called the

1737
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,400
hole-in-the-wall program where they put

1738
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,799
computers in public spaces in in

1739
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,319
Southeast Asia. Um anyway, there like

1740
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,079
there are millions of parents who live

1741
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,520
through the pandemic that can confirm

1742
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,319
that kids with laptops cannot teach

1743
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,839
anything to themselves.

1744
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,520
Um South is interesting to me because

1745
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:27,520
there are millions of people who have

1746
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,839
watched his um 2011 TED talk about this

1747
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,599
model. there are many many fewer people

1748
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,440
who read an interview that he did in

1749
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,599
2019 with District Administration

1750
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,440
magazine. Um so District Administration

1751
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,640
is like a little trade magazine for

1752
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,960
superintendent. Um in between um

1753
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,960
starting Khan Academy in 2019, he built

1754
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,359
his own school called the the Khan Lab

1755
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,200
School. Um it's a private school. It's

1756
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,040
in the Bay Area, California. It costs 20

1757
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,559
or $30,000 or something like that to go

1758
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,599
there for a year. But it's basically his

1759
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,680
laboratory. Like he can sort of

1760
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,119
implement any model he wanted. He can

1761
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,720
pick his own faculty. He can pick his

1762
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,880
own curriculum. He can recruit whatever

1763
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,240
students he wants. Um, and he does this

1764
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,760
for a few years. And he says, "Now that

1765
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,119
I run a school, I see that some of this

1766
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,640
stuff is not as easy to accomplish

1767
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,000
compared to how it sounds theoretically.

1768
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,599
It's taken me and the Khan Academy

1769
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,280
longer to realize this, but not everyone

1770
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,640
can easily move to a mastery based

1771
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,079
self-paced learning model overnight.

1772
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,599
That's hard to do. There a bunch of

1773
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,119
efficacy studies for that type of model,

1774
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,480
and they're robust, but change is hard.

1775
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,400
More recently, we're seeing that if

1776
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,240
students put 30 to minutes to an hour

1777
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,599
per week or one class period per week

1778
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,280
towards softwarebased self-paced

1779
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,559
learning, schools will see a 20 to 30%

1780
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,000
greater than expected gain on state

1781
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,599
assessments. That's exciting because

1782
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,359
that's a dosage that's very doable in

1783
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,799
mainstream classrooms. We tell schools

1784
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,400
to give students 30 to 60 minutes of

1785
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,920
Khan Academy per week with teachers

1786
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,119
doing traditional curriculum four days a

1787
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,040
week and you're going to get dramatic

1788
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,920
improvement. You'll get the best of both

1789
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:45,520
worlds. Um, so this is like a pretty big

1790
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,760
step away from let's reinvent video with

1791
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,520
education. It's it's saying like instead

1792
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,040
of reinventing education with video,

1793
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,920
let's do practice problems one day a

1794
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,280
week. Um and uh you know again you can

1795
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,040
think about like is this disrupting

1796
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,240
education or is education domesticating

1797
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,400
the system. But there's something which

1798
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,799
struck me about this argument which is

1799
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,480
like I think I've heard this before. Um

1800
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,440
and one of the earliest places you can

1801
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,680
find it is in 1994. Um so there are a

1802
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,920
group of folks at uh Carnegie Melon um

1803
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,839
who took a bunch of computers um that

1804
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,880
had online pract digital they wouldn't

1805
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,400
have been online network they would have

1806
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,920
been digital practice problems brought

1807
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,240
them into in the Pittsburgh public

1808
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,160
schools um and said to the teachers hey

1809
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,160
teach regularly three days a week and do

1810
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,520
this two days a week and apparently for

1811
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,319
most part the teachers were like eh

1812
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:31,520
we'll do it one day a week um and uh

1813
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:33,040
they got you know um the experimental

1814
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,799
classes outperformed students in

1815
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,640
comparison classes by 15% on

1816
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,240
standardized tests and 100% on test

1817
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,319
targeting these objectives. So like

1818
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,160
roughly the same order of magnitude kind

1819
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,200
of gains at Khan Academy slot. So

1820
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,240
anyway, one of the ways that you could

1821
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,319
frame that um is that with like 10 years

1822
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,240
and $150 million of philanthropic

1823
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,760
investment, Salon learned what you could

1824
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,079
have learned with a trip to the library.

1825
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,000
Um uh which is that like they're already

1826
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,680
existing models for how you can

1827
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,880
incorporate intelligent tutors and

1828
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,200
practice problems into what you're doing

1829
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,599
and they work pretty well. I'm curious

1830
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,760
to know so we discussed that like this

1831
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,640
individualized

1832
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,839
has many benefits. Um, but I'm curious

1833
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,839
to know if there's any studies that

1834
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:15,599
show particular subjects they might be

1835
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:20,559
more effective or not. That's great.

1836
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:23,839
Yeah. Yeah. Um, many um it you it really

1837
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,000
mostly works in math. Um uh the the

1838
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,400
evidence for the current EV the current

1839
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,559
evidence for for base for reading is

1840
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,839
very weak. Um and we'll talk we'll show

1841
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,799
more examples of that and read some more

1842
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,559
papers about that for next class. Um but

1843
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,880
when when we try to so here's the trick.

1844
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,480
When we try to evaluate these tools um

1845
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,319
you don't want to look at any individual

1846
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,280
study. A because any individual study

1847
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:46,319
can be wrong. Um and be well maybe

1848
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,160
that's the main reason. Any individual

1849
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,839
study can be wrong. Um so what you do is

1850
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,680
you do what's called a meta analysis.

1851
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,280
You look at groups of studies. You say

1852
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,880
like what are all the studies that have

1853
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,240
been done with intelligent tutors in

1854
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,599
math? What are all the studies that have

1855
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,079
been done with intelligent tutors in

1856
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,799
reading? And generally speaking, the

1857
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,640
only places that we

1858
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:06,240
find consistently more positive things

1859
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,400
which are not hugely positive is in

1860
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:12,240
math. Um what complicates that a little

1861
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,240
bit um is that some of the some of the

1862
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,400
strongest studies and evidence for

1863
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,079
mathematics have been more recently. Um

1864
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,240
now one possibility is that that's a

1865
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,440
fluke. Another possibility is that we're

1866
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,400
figuring stuff out. So you sort of have

1867
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,760
to decide to yourself like do you want

1868
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,359
to average over the whole length of

1869
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,039
studies or do you want to sort of

1870
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:28,240
reinforce your ideas based on more

1871
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,760
recent things? I'll make an argument

1872
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,280
next class that actually like some of

1873
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,440
the recent studies in math seem to be

1874
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,520
pretty robust. Um people try this stuff

1875
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,200
in early language acquisition. Um

1876
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,559
Dualingo I think has some evidence that

1877
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,240
they can teach you about as much in

1878
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,839
Dualingo as you learn in a first year

1879
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,280
college class. Um although you should

1880
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,880
probably note that like you really don't

1881
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,520
learn that much in a first year college

1882
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,119
class in the language. Um computer

1883
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,160
science uses tons of things like this.

1884
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,920
Probably many of you who've done

1885
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,720
computer programming with cat soup and

1886
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,920
things like that. They probably have

1887
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,280
sort of hinting and other sorts of

1888
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,559
things that are that are baked into

1889
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:01,280
that. um doesn't doesn't seem to be very

1890
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,119
involved in later language acquisition.

1891
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,720
People don't use it that much in science

1892
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,480
or in social studies. Little, you know,

1893
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,000
a little bit in like chemistry, physics.

1894
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,359
Some places have some practice problems,

1895
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,599
things like that, but not about like the

1896
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:13,839
conceptual um understanding, more about

1897
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:17,119
the sort of procedural fluency kinds of

1898
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:20,000
things. Um, and so they they definitely

1899
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:22,000
seem to, you know, they they what they

1900
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,359
require in addition to these like item

1901
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,960
response theory models which figure out

1902
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:26,720
how difficult an item is, is it has to

1903
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,240
be able to be autograded and there's

1904
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,240
only certain kinds because it has to be

1905
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,839
able to instantly it has to be able to

1906
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,839
instantly assign you what the next item

1907
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:36,799
is. Um, and so the only way we can do

1908
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,319
that is we choose items um where we can

1909
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,680
be pretty confident that a machine can

1910
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,880
can ascertain whether or not you've done

1911
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,319
it correctly. You can do that in any

1912
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,160
field with multiple choice, but multiple

1913
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:46,079
choice is kind of it's good for some

1914
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,680
things. It's kind of boring. Oh, I was

1915
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,680
just going to ask like when you said

1916
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,599
that it's good with working with math,

1917
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:55,119
like I guess you sort of answered it

1918
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,200
later in your speech just now, but um

1919
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,799
what do you mean by it's good with math?

1920
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,640
Because there's a difference, a really

1921
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:03,039
strong one between procedural fluency

1922
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,359
and like conceptual understanding. And

1923
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,920
when I was thinking about writing this

1924
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:11,440
thing, I actually loved Yeah. And the

1925
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:14,000
reason was because like my math teachers

1926
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,799
were trying really hard, but it was like

1927
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,559
boring. And Il was like something I

1928
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:20,880
could use where you like don't have to

1929
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,640
do the same grade. You can like go past

1930
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,680
your grade and then you learn a bunch of

1931
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,520
procedural stuff and you feel like

1932
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,440
you're so smart or whatever. But that's

1933
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,599
not true because procedural fluency is

1934
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,280
not it's not mathematics. It's definit

1935
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,400
Yeah, it's not really math. I mean a

1936
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,160
riff that I'll give you a little bit

1937
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,280
later in the semester. So in the the

1938
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,599
common core state standards for

1939
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,440
mathematics um describe mathematical

1940
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,839
modeling as five steps. There are five

1941
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,000
things mathematicians do. Um they find a

1942
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:45,760
problem in the real world. They arrange

1943
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,760
that problem in some kind of structure

1944
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,160
like an equation or a table or

1945
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,960
schematic. They resolve the computation

1946
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,880
in that structure. They make a claim

1947
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,039
about how the answer relates to the real

1948
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,520
world. So it's like 47 board feet or 47

1949
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,839
kittens or 47 acres. Um and then they

1950
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,240
explain their reasoning. Um, our

1951
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:06,079
autograders can only assess one of those

1952
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,079
five things. Um, our autograders

1953
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:10,480
basically can only assess whether or not

1954
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,760
you like address the computational part

1955
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,319
of things. They basically don't work for

1956
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,720
the other four. Um, if you use

1957
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:18,240
mathematics

1958
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,000
professionally, the like the only value

1959
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,440
you have as a human being are in the

1960
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,119
four things the autograders can't

1961
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,480
evaluate. Like if you use mathematics

1962
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,079
professionally, you probably have

1963
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,920
machines compute all the answers of the

1964
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,440
things that you're doing. um the value

1965
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,480
that you as a human bring is in like

1966
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,839
figuring out what problems are

1967
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,119
interesting and setting them up and

1968
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,319
explaining them to other people and

1969
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,680
putting the answer into some kind of

1970
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,960
context. So I think you're absolutely

1971
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,680
right. Now what do we mean? What do we

1972
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,599
when we say it improves math? Um almost

1973
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,000
always what we mean is that in a

1974
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:47,520
randomized control trial um people in

1975
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
the control condition get one um set get

1976
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,920
get some average score usually on an

1977
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,680
annual state test and people in the

1978
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,160
experimental condition get a higher

1979
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,760
average score um again on the same state

1980
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,680
test. That's what we usually be mean by

1981
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,200
math that works by by having a thing

1982
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,240
work in math or any other subject or

1983
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,520
things like that. We might not use a

1984
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,880
state test. We might use some other

1985
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,400
particular evaluation or things like

1986
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,240
that. But that's almost always the way

1987
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,720
these things are evaluated. And if those

1988
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,000
tests those tests are called math tests,

1989
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,079
but they don't test you on everything

1990
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,440
that's important in math. Um, and we'll

1991
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,799
get into that more as we go along, too.

1992
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,319
So, you've identified a sort of crucial

1993
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,080
issue. Let me try to give you a few

1994
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,640
other things to send you on your on your

1995
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,400
way with. Um, there is a wonderful book

1996
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,120
by Morgan Ames called The Charisma

1997
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,719
Machine. um which studies uh the one

1998
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,080
laptop per child program. It show it

1999
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,359
studies a particular implementation in

2000
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,000
Paraguay which was kind of a cool

2001
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,520
country to study um because like you

2002
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,799
could you you basically can like know

2003
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,960
everything that's happening in Paraguay.

2004
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:41,440
It's kind of a small place. Um and and

2005
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,199
Morgan was embedded there. Um she argues

2006
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,040
that there are sort of two kinds of

2007
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:46,799
stances that people can take towards

2008
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,000
technology. One is the charismatic

2009
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,759
stance. The idea that like these

2010
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,600
technologies are going to be new and

2011
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,120
different and transformative and that

2012
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,480
the future will be brand new and

2013
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,080
different because of these things. And

2014
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,719
that's what Salo Khan sounds like in his

2015
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,319
TED talk. Um an an alternative stance is

2016
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,719
the tinkering stance, which is what

2017
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:05,520
Salan sounds like, you know, sounds like

2018
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:07,600
um in his district administrative uh

2019
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,759
interview. Um that existing systems

2020
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,520
domesticate new technologies, that a

2021
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,040
pretty good guide for the future of

2022
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,359
schooling and education technology is

2023
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,040
the past. Um and it's not that we can't

2024
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,040
make things better, but that making

2025
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,640
things better is hard and it takes a lot

2026
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,480
of time and involves sort of building

2027
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,679
capacity as community. You could think

2028
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:28,000
of um failure to disrupt is basically a

2029
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,679
celebration of the tinkering stance um

2030
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,359
which you don't have to agree with but

2031
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,440
the but the one of the hearts of the

2032
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,759
argument is that charismatics don't

2033
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,600
really help education systems. Um making

2034
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,600
huge promises that we can't deliver on

2035
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,199
is not helpful. It diverts resources

2036
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,960
away for whether they could be most

2037
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:45,040
useful. A much more useful thing to do

2038
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,359
is to be real realistic with school

2039
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:49,120
systems about what's possible. to accept

2040
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:52,239
the fact that usually the things we

2041
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:53,759
improve are are only in some subjects

2042
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:55,280
but not others and not even in the

2043
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,800
entirety of those subjects but only in

2044
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,080
part of those subjects and only for

2045
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,920
certain kinds of students in certain

2046
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,760
kinds of contexts. And it's still worth

2047
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,080
pursuing those things because the way

2048
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,320
you make education systems better is you

2049
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,239
just like relentlessly try to improve

2050
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,679
little bits of them by a little amount

2051
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:12,239
over and over and over again. If you do

2052
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,000
that long enough they get better. Um but

2053
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,600
uh if you want you know the the

2054
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
underlying argument behind the whole

2055
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,880
book um is like stop trying to disrupt

2056
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,320
things and instead take you know accept

2057
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,640
the limits of what can be accomplished

2058
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,400
with education technology but also

2059
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,560
recognize that even if the improvements

2060
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,400
we can make are small small improvements

2061
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:34,159
compounded over lots of students over a

2062
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,159
long period of time really matters.

2063
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:40,239
Um I want to say briefly and maybe I

2064
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:43,360
won't finish this but um personalization

2065
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:45,199
was a pedagogical idea but it's also

2066
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,480
connected to sort of broader political

2067
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,440
economies. I think I sort of first

2068
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,520
brought this up when we talked about

2069
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,760
instructionism and constructionism too.

2070
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,080
Um that these these pedagogies can be

2071
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,360
aligned with values. The instructionists

2072
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,040
say learning is hard. The

2073
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,920
constructionists say learning is natural

2074
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,320
and easy. um that therefore schools

2075
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,840
should be disciplined, rigorous,

2076
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,640
controlled, schools should be free,

2077
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,000
democracyinducing. Like there are values

2078
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,520
that get associated with these things

2079
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,080
and there were values that got

2080
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,400
associated with personalization. In

2081
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:17,120
particular, the emphasis on the

2082
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,880
individual as like the main unit of

2083
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,960
analysis when thinking about how to

2084
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,480
improve schools. Um to me, it's not at

2085
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,080
all clear that that's right. So, one

2086
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,600
thing that people thought about a lot

2087
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,960
and this related to muks and intelligent

2088
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,440
tutors and things like that is folks

2089
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,280
have said like it's crazy how many

2090
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,960
different things we ask teachers to do.

2091
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,400
They need to design assessments, design

2092
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,239
lessons, grade assessments, give

2093
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,000
instruction, coach people, provide what

2094
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:39,199
the British call pastoral care, which is

2095
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,400
like taking care of people and making

2096
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,679
them feel good and helping them when

2097
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,440
they cry and put on band-aids and things

2098
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,360
like that. Why on earth would we expect

2099
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,440
an adult to be good at all those things?

2100
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,440
Um, like what if some people are just

2101
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,960
really good instructors? Like what if we

2102
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,800
just have these rockstar teachers like

2103
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,400
Sal Khan and Sebastian Thun who are just

2104
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,000
better at doing direct instruction. Why

2105
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,239
are we asking every teacher in the

2106
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
country to be able to explain math when

2107
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:02,400
Sao Khan is really good at explaining

2108
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,679
math? Um and then you know we could

2109
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:07,679
unbundle that part of their work out um

2110
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,360
and instead just have them focus on the

2111
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,880
things that can't do which is putting

2112
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,000
band-aids on kids and grading their

2113
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,840
feedback and talking to their parents

2114
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,040
and those kinds of things. So not not

2115
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,120
crazy at the start of it. Um people have

2116
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,040
taken this idea even further which is

2117
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,360
something like what if we just unbundled

2118
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,840
schools entirely like why do we pack all

2119
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,920
these different functions in schools? Um

2120
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,159
why don't we have schools do things that

2121
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,080
they're um partic you know why why don't

2122
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,640
why don't we let people gain learning

2123
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,199
experiences where they want to. Um there

2124
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,480
is a great leftist thinker named Ivan

2125
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,239
Illich. We're going to read some of his

2126
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,920
book, Deschooling Society later, which

2127
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,239
was written at the dawn of personal

2128
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,840
computing as an incredible prediction

2129
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:48,080
about the future of learning online.

2130
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,159
Totally extraordinary. Um, but he was

2131
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,159
very taken by the ideas of this guy

2132
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:54,400
named Milton Friedman um who's a very

2133
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:56,480
famous economist um who believed really

2134
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,679
strongly in the power of markets. Um

2135
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,040
that governments weren't really good at

2136
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,320
solving problems, that markets were

2137
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,800
really good at solving problems. Like

2138
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,280
what if we got rid of schools and just

2139
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,360
had people engage in a kind of

2140
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,120
marketplace of learning activities? Like

2141
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,239
what if we sort of unbundled the

2142
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,320
different functions of schools? Like why

2143
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:14,239
do you have to take math and English um

2144
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,159
and physical education and sex education

2145
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,000
from the same institution? Like why

2146
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:20,000
don't you just let people buy those

2147
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,800
learning experiences from wherever they

2148
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,440
want to? Um this is the horseshoe is

2149
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,520
here because this is like part of the

2150
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,520
arguments where sort of people on the

2151
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,800
left people on the right suddenly found

2152
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,520
themselves in this sort of strange

2153
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:37,440
convergence um around personalization.

2154
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:40,400
Um maybe maybe I'll pass this just to um

2155
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:43,600
so the idea like the pedagogical ideas

2156
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:46,159
of personalization got connected to a

2157
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,760
broader political uh project which is

2158
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,960
enormously successful in the United

2159
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,000
States particularly in conservative

2160
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:54,320
states right now of trying to um

2161
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,840
refashion school systems with less of a

2162
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,120
focus on schools and much more of a

2163
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:03,040
focus on individual students. Um

2164
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:04,640
uh a very popular idea um among people

2165
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,640
who advocate for this sort of thing is

2166
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,640
to say like why do we give monies to

2167
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,239
schools to educate people? What if we

2168
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,960
took those that money and gave it

2169
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:15,840
directly to students? Um uh sometimes

2170
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,520
these systems were called vouchers. Um

2171
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,199
like don't don't send people to public

2172
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,120
school, give them a voucher to buy any

2173
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,920
school they want. Um it turned out the

2174
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,080
word voucher was extremely unpopular. um

2175
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,840
and like evoked a a voucher that you

2176
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,440
would get uh like in an airport when

2177
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,280
your flight is canceled that doesn't pay

2178
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,800
for your hotel and things like that. Um

2179
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,760
for a while they experimented with this

2180
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,960
idea of like student backpacks um like

2181
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,320
the money would go into a student

2182
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,159
backpack but that evoked this idea of

2183
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,800
like backpacks full of cash which was

2184
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:45,280
kind of unsemly. Um so the so the term

2185
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,080
that that students right that folks use

2186
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,560
right now um is uh to fund students

2187
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,760
instead of systems. Um give money to

2188
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,560
individual students. These are all the

2189
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,239
states in 2023 um that passed or were

2190
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,000
considering legislation that would say

2191
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,440
we're going to take your property taxes.

2192
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,640
We're not going to give them to schools.

2193
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,960
We're going to give them to individual

2194
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,520
kids. Um and the individual kids can

2195
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,880
then use those dollars to buy whatever

2196
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,520
public school they want or to buy a

2197
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,880
parochial school or to buy pay more

2198
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,040
money and buy a private school or any

2199
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,760
kind of things like that. Um were those

2200
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,719
funds given to all students? Uh or was

2201
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,960
there a criteria? The idea the ideal

2202
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,480
model is that everyone would get them.

2203
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,800
um like if like if you believe in this

2204
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,239
sort of free market system um the only

2205
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,560
way public schools should exist is if

2206
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:29,600
they compete against the market compete

2207
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,120
in the market for other kinds of

2208
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,480
schools. You can also imagine you don't

2209
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,159
even need schools like what if you

2210
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,080
bought your math from Khan Academy and

2211
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:38,000
your health class from CVS and your

2212
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,600
language class from Rosetta Stone and

2213
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,520
your sexed class from the Big Valley

2214
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,960
Creation Science Museum and your English

2215
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,000
class from the National Writing Project

2216
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:48,000
and things like that. Um and you know

2217
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,760
this is like a broader political vision

2218
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,320
of what schooling could be in the future

2219
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,480
that online learning um enabled and to

2220
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,920
some extent um parts of it are

2221
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,600
enormously successful. I would say the

2222
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,360
pandemic because people basically hated

2223
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,800
online learning as a whole sort of threw

2224
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,440
cold water on a whole bunch of these

2225
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,960
things. Um but um a thing I want us to

2226
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,040
keep coming back to as we talk about

2227
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,960
things like personalized learning um is

2228
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,480
that they are they can they can be

2229
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,239
construed as pedagogies but these

2230
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,640
pedagogies are almost always connected

2231
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,960
to like broader political movements um

2232
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,400
about how we organize schools. Um the

2233
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,320
most political question you could

2234
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,159
possibly ask is how should we raise our

2235
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,400
children? Um in some ways it seems like

2236
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:26,719
an extremely technical question um but

2237
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,040
it is a deeply moral value laden

2238
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:31,280
question as well. Okay. Um, we will

2239
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,040
continue this uh little bit and say some

2240
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,400
more things about it and uh look at some

2241
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,000
more well we'll probably get pretty deep

2242
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,600
into the evidence in the paper that you

2243
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,120
read um trying to get at some of the

2244
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,800
questions that Mari asked before of like

2245
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,320
like what is the evidence base for how

2246
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,520
well these things work some of Alvo's

2247
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,400
questions like what does it mean to work

2248
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,000
we'll do a bunch of that with

2249
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,520
intelligent tutors um on uh Monday um

2250
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,640
have a wonderful weekend I look forward

2251
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,920
to getting and reading all your papers

2252
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,040
and if I can help you with anything let

2253
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,040
me know thanks everybody
