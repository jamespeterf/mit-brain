00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,559
hello and welcome to another footnote

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,000
episode of energy reads my name is Kelly

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,840
Travers and I am your host I'm excited

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,040
to introduce today's guest Kristoff

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,640
Reinhardt Kristoff is a professor of

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,520
architecture at MIT working in the field

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,640
of Sustainable Building design and

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,760
environmental modeling he leads mit's

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,560
sustainable Design Lab and is the

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,080
director of The Building Technology

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,240
Program he is also the head of several

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,920
spin-off companies with products used in

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,399
practice and in education in over 90

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,360
countries we recently shared some of his

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
research in the audio article titled

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,520
cutting Urban carbon emissions by

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
retrofitting buildings while reading

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,079
this article I was surprised to learn

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,840
that buildings can be responsible for

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,879
more than half of a city's carbon

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
emissions new buildings are now

22
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,120
typically designed in ways to minimize

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,879
energy use in carbon emissions but there

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,160
are still a lot of older buildings that

25
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,399
need to be cleaned up Kristoff and his

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,280
team are working to help this effort

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,239
they have launched a publicly accessible

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,960
website called .io that provides a

29
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,600
series of simulation tools as well as a

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,720
process for using them to help

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,479
neighborhoods and cities calculate their

32
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,960
current building energy use and

33
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,880
resulting carbon emissions and then from

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,280
there what initiatives they can take to

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,840
reach their carbon reduction goals

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,320
Kristoff I've been looking forward to

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,560
this conversation and learning more

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,119
about your work so thank you for joining

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,920
thank you for having me one thing I've

40
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,000
been wondering your bio says that you

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
you are a building scientist what does

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
this mean exactly that is a good

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,720
question and I get get asked that quite

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,159
a lot um building science is the the

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,479
study of buildings as the name suggest

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,479
and it has various subdomains so first

47
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,079
of all how do buildings function and so

48
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,840
that has a lot to do with the physics

49
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,560
like the heat flow going in and out of

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,840
the buildings the buildings being

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
physical manifestations in the world so

52
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,680
how do we actually keep the temperature

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
comfortable in place

54
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,600
now there are of course other components

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,479
to building science like how do people

56
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,239
operate buildings how do they accept

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,040
their thermost how do they decide uh to

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,239
um turn when do they decide to open

59
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,080
their windows turn on the lights so that

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,640
moves then from physics into the areas

61
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,640
of Psy psychology and sociology who is

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,879
living in this building what can they

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,080
afford then there's of course also the

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,760
big question how are buildings designed

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,560
so what's the process of putting them

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,120
together and that puts us to

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,840
architecture and then even as buildings

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,640
are maintained uh facility management

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,720
real estate and so for so generally

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,440
building science is a pretty wide field

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,280
uh most building scientists used to be

72
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,280
engineers and physicists so the focus

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,599
has really for a long term been on the

74
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,920
physical manifestation of buildings and

75
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:54,840
understanding how they work but as a a

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,239
wonderful new trend of field has uh

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,080
become a lot more diverse in terms of

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,640
what people are in the field as as well

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,040
as their interest and the reason for

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,159
this is really uh two drivers one you

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,239
already alluded to the recognition that

82
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:14,280
in the age of climate change buildings

83
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,879
are globally responsible for uh 40% of

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,560
carbon emissions so this is obviously a

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,920
huge opportunity and problem that that

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,120
we have to deal with and then the other

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,519
component is that um over the last 50 60

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,519
years uh we've all started to spend more

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
and more and more time in buildings

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,040
where I think the average people still

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,319
think is 90% but during Co many of us

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,920
probably spend more than 90% of our time

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,879
in a building so the conditions that we

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,879
are generating building and the impacts

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,720
on our well-being are enormous so hence

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,680
this uh ever increasing interest in the

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,239
field so it's funny that you mentioned

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
physics a couple of times because I

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
understand that was your original

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,200
background so what sparked your shift to

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,879
architecture yeah physics uh the reason

102
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,079
that I laid out uh that's my initial

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,439
passion and still my passion and it's

104
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,920
useful to have that in building science

105
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,560
but uh as I already alluded to there are

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,239
so many other aspects important for

107
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Building Technology and I always want to

108
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,680
be and aspire to be at the table where

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,079
decisions are being made and when you

110
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,040
look at the face of buildings that's of

111
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,440
course architecture and the people that

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,199
work with the general public to make and

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,560
maintain and renew buildings so that

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,360
prompted me towards this ship well

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,280
speaking of decisions and you know to

116
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,080
talk more about the article that we had

117
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,560
read recently on the podcast um how

118
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,280
important do you think it is for cities

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,440
to really encourage these building

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,639
retrofits I mean

121
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,440
worldwide uh we know that by 2050 our

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,000
expectation is that the global build

123
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,800
area is going to double which is

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,440
actually quite staming if you think how

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
many thousands of years we have spent

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,840
building the buildings that we currently

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,320
have that the projectionist that we

128
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
might have twice as many buildings in

129
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,400
under 30 years at the same time that's

130
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,160
wild that it's it's a scary and amazing

131
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,840
fact means it's good to be in the

132
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,800
construction sector because you're not

133
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,240
going to run out of work but uh of

134
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,759
course it also means that we really have

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,319
to focus that are already existing we

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
new buildings generally uh tend to be

137
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,400
more efficient because we have more

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,720
stringent building codes in many parts

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,919
of the world so we really want to uh f

140
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,400
focus on the main carbon emitters the

141
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,360
existing building stock and in the case

142
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,880
of the us about 2/3 of the buildings

143
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,840
that we currently have well they will be

144
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,639
they will make up twoth thirds of our

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,880
building stock in 30 years and about a

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,600
third half of our current building stop

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,479
we are adding to our buildings so

148
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
overall retrofitting buildings are inici

149
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
old buildings are inefficient and they

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,120
constitute the majority of buildings

151
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,840
that will be around by 20 so do you

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,759
think making these retrofits are

153
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,360
actually going to make a difference to

154
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,520
these carbon reduction goals retrofits

155
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,000
are enormously efficient especially the

156
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,360
ARs is really and this is where our tool

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,880
is focusing on what are the lowest thing

158
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,360
foods for different types of buildings

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,880
to reduce carb and sometimes these are

160
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,520
surprising facts so one of the things

161
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,160
that actually saves us a lot is for

162
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,440
example if you get more efficient

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,039
appliances say at a dishwasher or

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,759
um washing machine then these systems

165
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,800
use a lot less electricity energy at the

166
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,840
same time they use uh a lot less water

167
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,520
you can half your water consumption and

168
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,280
water nowadays is energy in many parts

169
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,400
of the world so you have this this

170
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,440
double dip instantly and um and of

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,800
course it pays for itself

172
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,879
relativ uh so yeah doing retrofit and

173
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,120
buildings can be enormously efficient

174
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:08,000
you can on average with offthe shelf

175
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,520
technology reduce the carbon emission of

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,199
a city's building stock by 60 70 80% wow

177
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,000
so do you feel like there's kind of one

178
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,160
sure place where a city can start when

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,560
considering what retrofits to prioritize

180
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,680
or is this kind of really City dependent

181
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,319
that is a good question I would say have

182
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,280
several answers when we think of how we

183
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,000
are approaching cities right now we are

184
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,639
basically we have developed this app

185
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,120
that takes cities by their hand and

186
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,440
allows them to explore various

187
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,240
upgrades that they can take for their

188
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,240
buildings let's say we are focusing on

189
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
all the old single family homes we're

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,120
doing some insulation we make the

191
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,159
buildings a little tighter where does

192
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,280
this get you to and uh very often well

193
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,759
nobody has a real sense from that before

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,680
and how this is going to translate at

195
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,120
the city level we know that certain

196
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,280
things in certain climates work very

197
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,360
well

198
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,560
but I think one of the advantages of us

199
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,319
working in workshops with City and their

200
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,720
sustainability Champion to go through

201
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,039
these processes is they own the results

202
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,599
more it's one thing if I come and I tell

203
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,520
you have to do this this this and this

204
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,360
and it proba g acrost an enormous amount

205
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,120
of money and they might not be that

206
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
interested in that technology for

207
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,080
various reasons they might not even

208
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,960
believe that this is the right thing

209
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,560
sometimes this is counterintuitive so I

210
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,959
think going through this really as a g

211
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:37,599
gamification type for this process of

212
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,959
personal um Discovery can be very useful

213
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,719
and ultimately I think it also helps to

214
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:46,160
develop a very good carbon emission

215
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,120
reduction plan so General cities city

216
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
mayor City governments mean any

217
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,160
government is very good at coming up

218
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,399
with outrageous goals anybody heard okay

219
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,680
London or New York or Boston want to be

220
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,399
NSO or near Neto in 25 50 then the

221
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,720
chances if you are the municipality

222
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,600
anywhere you're going to say I want to

223
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,160
be the same thing so we're going to tell

224
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,839
anybody that's all go without really

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,680
having a clear uh mind how are you

226
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,920
actually going to get there and I think

227
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,760
this is uh leads to the situation that

228
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,600
you have right now where the

229
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,600
administration in a lot of cities don't

230
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,880
really even know how what to communicate

231
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,200
on what what to do whereas with these uh

232
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,240
reduction PL it's becomes very concrete

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
we can basically tell every citizen if

234
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,560
you do this this and this to your

235
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,440
building if we are all doing this then

236
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,240
we reach our goal and in a way that

237
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,360
liberates the policy maker because

238
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,079
ultimately it's not them but it's the

239
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,120
the owners of the building that do this

240
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:54,360
work so I think these um uh tools are

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,120
very useful for uh building consensus

242
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,600
around a cent goal well so you mentioned

243
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,800
um a moment ago that you created an App

244
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,320
for this um that's u.io okay so I know

245
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,160
um part of that analysis that you do on

246
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,640
these different retrofit policies you're

247
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,240
using something called an urban building

248
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,399
energy model which is ubm can you tell

249
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,680
us how this model works exactly so maybe

250
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,480
it's worthwh going a step back if you

251
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,920
are in the business of designing an

252
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,720
energy efficient building then for the

253
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,720
long term we've been relying on

254
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,800
something that's called a b a building

255
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,959
energy mod which is basically a

256
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,519
physics-based model that can be linked

257
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,959
to an architectural model of the

258
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,800
building which basically calculates

259
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,000
based on physics engineering based

260
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
equations and on a local climate file

261
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,760
the energy use of this particular

262
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,600
building and then for a long term what

263
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,279
we've done then is that there has been a

264
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,600
specialty consultant working key

265
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,040
ambitious project with the architect to

266
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,760
run these models and say we are

267
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,360
designing the building in this way it's

268
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,600
going to be very efficient now the

269
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,160
models typically take quite some effort

270
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,320
because it's one building it's one

271
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,680
architect I mean the costs are pretty

272
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,760
high so we couldn't just repeat that

273
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,160
process with every building in Boston

274
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,800
because it would be too expensive so

275
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,000
this is why we started 10 years ago to

276
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,360
develop this Urban building energy

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,079
modeling which is basically a

278
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,839
combination of big data so G data

279
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,519
lighter data anything that we have

280
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,760
available in our time which we can scra

281
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,639
and get for all buildings in the city s

282
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,200
and what the buildings used for how old

283
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:42,440
it is so and that we are combining bya

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,600
in the cloud with um with our physics

285
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,600
based models we of course have to take

286
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,639
certain shortcut simplification but we

287
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,160
figured out ways especially for these

288
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:56,519
early stage you know policy decision

289
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,440
tools to create a good enough digital

290
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,079
representation some people might call

291
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,079
this a digital Twi of the city to be

292
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,399
able to say okay we can reproduce what

293
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,160
goes on in the city right now and once

294
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,440
we have that and it's based on the

295
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,079
underlying physics we can do any upgrade

296
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,839
you're interested anything you would

297
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,959
want to come up we could basically say

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,560
what would happen if we applied that to

299
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:21,720
the city and this is how these we models

300
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,800
function now maybe one thing that is

301
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,160
interesting to just show the trajectory

302
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,360
when we first came out of this in 2016

303
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,000
we built the first PR model of a large

304
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,560
anywhere that was in Boston and that was

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
of course worked with the Boston R

306
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Development Authority that was a really

307
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,760
expensive project it was great that we

308
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,120
did it we explored what could be done at

309
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,279
the same time similar activities

310
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,800
happened in other major cities around

311
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,000
the world but this is not something that

312
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,040
a small

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,800
place would do would would be able to

314
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,680
afford even though of course most people

315
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,839
live in smaller places that don't have

316
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,560
the front so this new web app

317
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,000
particularly focuses on the idea rather

318
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,279
than having like an expert expert user

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,880
who has to be a consultant and an energy

320
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,880
modeler and a big data person so

321
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,680
something that is barely affordable or

322
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,639
trainable we kind of broken this up into

323
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,800
little little pieces we need a

324
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,160
sustainability Champion somebody that

325
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,760
cares which just about any town in

326
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,160
municipality PA we need a GIS manager

327
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,240
and that nearly everybody as especially

328
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,079
in the US because our property taxes are

329
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,320
linked to the digital GS model so this

330
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:41,000
is usually somebody that's the financial

331
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,240
bloodline of most cities so this person

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,920
exists as well and then energy modelers

333
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,160
are pretty common so we bely in this

334
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
case go through this eight-step process

335
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,800
where we bring the three parties

336
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,279
together and we can dramatically reduce

337
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,480
the cost that's the the idea behind so

338
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,600
this is kind of this question is a

339
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,959
little off the rails but um I'm really

340
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,959
curious cuz I was reading the story out

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:08,320
loud and so the model and your website

342
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,399
are spelled Ube M why is it pronounced

343
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,040
ubam instead of ubam because ubam just

344
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,279
seems like the obvious

345
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,880
choice I love it well as you might have

346
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,759
GED from my accent I'm German and I made

347
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,320
up that term together with Carlos ceso

348
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:28,000
who is Spanish maybe B it was natural to

349
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,959
say UB and we called it UB think it's

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,240
like an ubot I don't even though know

351
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:40,120
the that op me that so blame it on my

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,399
accent that we call and I guess that uh

353
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,320
people never questioned how we called it

354
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,279
maybe some people in the world say you

355
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,360
them and uh there we go I don't know

356
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,199
that's a great I love it yeah one of

357
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,240
those things where I never would have

358
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,240
thought of it except I'm was you know

359
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,120
wanted to get it right for the podcast

360
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,839
and when I was watching videos to try to

361
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,880
see you guys talking about it and how

362
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,320
you're pronouncing it I was like wait

363
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,199
what I have to like double check on this

364
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,160
so anyway I had to

365
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:13,759
ask all the Americans at the lab nobody

366
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,320
have a question that maybe you know my

367
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,360
they probably all have somewhat German

368
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,279
exence after the time that leave MIT

369
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,120
with me well thank you for being good

370
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,079
sport on my question so to test the

371
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,519
website that your team created you held

372
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,440
a 3-day workshop with policy makers from

373
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,880
eight different cities around the world

374
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
what surprised you the most about the

375
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,639
results from this Workshop there were a

376
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,040
few surprises and uh what was really

377
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,000
nice from the GetGo how enthusiastic

378
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,680
these cities were to participate when

379
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,120
you look at the list of cities it's in a

380
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,600
way quite remarkable we had

381
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:57,959
hirro Singapore Dublin he in Germany

382
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,800
Montreal like Flor nocus in Brazil um

383
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,800
some small place is in middleb in

384
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,480
Vermont and part of this was by Design

385
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,319
we just contacted people that we

386
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,680
somewhat knew in different parts of the

387
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,839
world and we wanted a variety of planets

388
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,759
and we wanted a variety of sizes because

389
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,279
we wanted to demonstrate that this works

390
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,440
everywhere but these are not like

391
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,240
long-standing

392
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,279
collaborative so I mean I was stunned

393
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,480
actually we uh contacted a whole bunch

394
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,800
and nearly everybody says yes so that

395
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,759
was the nice surprise before we started

396
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,480
because we felt this is really we hadit

397
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,639
a Nerf there which was very good right

398
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,759
so that that is something that we know

399
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,519
City want cities want to do it yeah I

400
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,519
think another component that was uh nice

401
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,199
for us to see is these three uh roles

402
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,680
that I talked about the sustainability

403
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,759
Champion the G manager and the energy

404
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,959
modeler we had kind of made this RS up

405
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,319
in a paper before when we laid out the

406
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,839
concept and suddenly remember this

407
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:05,160
people for example some uh group in uh

408
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,120
Sandi Springs in Atlanta who actually

409
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,240
had these titles and I had never met

410
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,640
anybody with this title so again it was

411
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,079
maybe a a happy coincidence but it was

412
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,839
again it really showed us that this mold

413
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,199
that we created fit actually to where

414
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,280
cities are going and we had tried a

415
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,319
couple of times to find the right angle

416
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,840
for this technology so that was that was

417
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,400
really postive another thing when when I

418
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,960
go three days later after the workshop

419
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,520
was done I would say one of the key

420
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,760
things that only after the fact done to

421
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,960
us that we had somehow forgotten to talk

422
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,320
about domestic hot water why is that

423
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,520
important uh so domestic hot water is

424
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,120
the hot water that you use in your

425
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,640
buildings when you take shower and the

426
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,559
application where you need hot water and

427
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,120
we know that uses a lot of energy and

428
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,880
actually if you go back to the 80s a lot

429
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,039
of our effort has really been focused

430
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,520
about the solar water systems and so

431
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:11,280
forth but right now we are so focused on

432
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,640
energy star appliances and that's all

433
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,400
good and on photo voltic and he comes

434
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,280
for eating that we found that once you

435
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,360
start modeling the cities and all these

436
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,679
things were done nobody had talked about

437
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,520
water so we have this significant

438
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,640
remainder that including us I would BL

439
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,760
that well on us nobody had ever talked

440
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,520
about anymore and so that was maybe one

441
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,080
of this this little things that where

442
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,440
people knew for a long time it's

443
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,400
important but we just are all choosing

444
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,600
to ignore it yeah I think um I started

445
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,080
thinking about hot water this past

446
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,559
winter when I was thinking my home is um

447
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,000
on natural gas and so thinking about the

448
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,640
fact that you know how much hot water

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm using in my shower or to wash dishes

450
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,960
is actually making such an impact so a

451
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,600
low shower at half the water that you

452
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,640
use during your shower I'm not sure if

453
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,480
you have one 15 bucks or so it's quite

454
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,200
amazing what it does and one of these

455
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,200
things like solid state lighting which

456
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,320
most people not have we should all at

457
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,799
the stand our low hanging technolog

458
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,760
absolutely that's a great one I'm

459
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,280
definitely putting that one in my back

460
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,679
pocket so you said that there are cities

461
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,679
that were from all over the place how

462
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,600
big of an impact did these different

463
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,039
locations and their climate have on the

464
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,919
results climate is of course heat well

465
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,799
first of all if you're in a very extreme

466
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,159
hot or cold climate then the technology

467
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:43,080
is completely different that people are

468
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,000
using I mean if you're in Singapore it's

469
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,320
Cooling and dehumidifying Air to be

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,880
comfortable if you're in Montreal it's

471
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,200
heating the air and in between there

472
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,760
there's a mixer of good one Technologies

473
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,400
so climate is very important now I think

474
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,120
what we sometimes look to be

475
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,440
self-evident is that that culture and

476
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,960
local interests are really important

477
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,400
well and so culture has several levs it

478
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,280
has just hold people traditionally put

479
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,120
together a building and in what building

480
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,799
techology do you live when you live in

481
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,240
Middlebury Vermont in Montreal the CH

482
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,480
are maybe you live in a single family or

483
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,440
home or you live in a triple DEA then

484
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,240
you live in Cairo or singapo you're more

485
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,400
likely to live in like a mid to

486
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,440
highrise and these buildings be

487
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,320
very differently and then another key

488
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,280
cultural uh component is how people want

489
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,039
to live so in a way there is especially

490
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,480
I noticed and I share that in uh in

491
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:50,120
Europe and here in the US in the

492
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,159
Northeast uh people like to live in Old

493
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,760
buildings that are renovated so usually

494
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,440
when you say I live in this building and

495
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,080
people near brag about if their building

496
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,840
is over 100 years old and and then kind

497
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,480
of the Assumption is that it's we uh I

498
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,520
think in many parts of the world that is

499
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,960
not desirable people want to live in a

500
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,840
new home and of course when we want to

501
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,880
be in the business of selling retrofit

502
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,400
that's a lot easier year than if you

503
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,919
would think I don't want to live in a

504
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,799
retrofitted building I don't want to

505
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,600
live in any Lo building let Al Lo

506
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,919
something that's like a secondhand show

507
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,279
repared right so I think those

508
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,559
components is really something that I

509
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,400
just me starting to understand that and

510
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,799
that of course has nothing to do with

511
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,559
what we've been traditionally building

512
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,880
on this is really more like really

513
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,720
fundamentally rethinking how do we how

514
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,480
do we acknowledge these cultural desires

515
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,520
and operate with them and so I know part

516
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,440
of the results you found were that these

517
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,720
initiatives that these cities had

518
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,200
already decided on it kind of revealed

519
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,200
that they actually weren't going to get

520
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,559
them to you know that reduction goal

521
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,760
that they had in mind and that you kind

522
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,799
of later looked further at what

523
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,360
decarbonizing the city's electric grid

524
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,760
would do what sort of impact does that

525
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,679
decarbonization make so there's a lot of

526
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,200
Focus right now on using more

527
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,039
electricity than fossil fuels so the

528
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,159
idea is when you use electricity with a

529
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,240
heat pump to heat your building then one

530
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,679
day we going to have all electricity

531
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,600
being generated from renewable energies

532
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,279
and then that makes sense because once

533
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,159
we have wind farms and solar in

534
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:41,960
sufficient quantity then our grid would

535
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,520
in principle one day be so clean that us

536
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,600
having switched everything towards

537
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,080
electricity works very well and so now

538
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,240
depending on where you are uh different

539
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,960
countries have different plans more or

540
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,679
less concrete how they're going to reach

541
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,400
this in the United States there's

542
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,159
actually a pretty concrete cancer plan

543
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,480
and you have pretty good predictions of

544
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,600
where how much carbon is in a kilowatt

545
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,720
hour of electricity right now and how

546
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,480
this is going to change and usually go

547
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,080
down over time so that helps you to

548
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,159
decide is it really a good idea to put

549
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,440
in a heat pump and depending on where

550
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,640
you are in some cases today you might

551
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,840
temporarily use more carbon or generate

552
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,520
more carbon by switching to a heat pump

553
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,760
if you happen to be in a state that

554
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,240
burns a lot of coal to create the

555
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,799
electricity but the longterm goal in all

556
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:39,039
cases is that this is going to disappear

557
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:41,480
so what we did for these cities we uh

558
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,039
looked at these plans and basically

559
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,840
wanted to see how these two uh effects

560
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,520
work in tendons so on the one hand

561
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,320
you're reducing carbon emissions uh from

562
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,360
the grid that's something where the city

563
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,960
doesn't have to do anything this just

564
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,880
happens to them not through them and

565
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,480
then on the other hand when you update

566
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,279
your buildings then hopefully you pick

567
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:08,159
electrically based uh technology so that

568
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:10,279
you fully benefit from this de one thing

569
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,679
I thought was interesting in the article

570
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,320
was that you noted that one of the

571
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,159
Cities you worked with owned both the

572
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,159
utility and the natural gas that it

573
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,279
burned and that this actually affected

574
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,120
their retrofit choices can you speak a

575
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,919
bit about that yeah absolutely so a lot

576
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,399
of cities I would say primarily in

577
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,080
Europe but in different parts of the

578
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:32,039
world own their local ities and the way

579
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,720
that often works is they might have a

580
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,520
power plant but usually they're

581
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,520
purchasing electricity or natural gas in

582
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,200
bulk but they own the distribution

583
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,200
system and generally that's something

584
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,279
very good because uh utility makes money

585
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,520
by definition there's a monopoly there

586
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:52,960
and if people use electricity they make

587
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,919
money and a lot of these cities then use

588
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,880
this Revenue to for example find public

589
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,440
transportation but on the other hand of

590
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,520
course there are situations where when

591
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,120
you do this you invested in certain

592
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,760
Technologies in a way one of the

593
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,520
technologies that are harder to deal

594
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,799
with is if you have a district heating

595
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,520
system that is fossil fuel powered so

596
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,320
that would mean you have basically a

597
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,840
fossil fuel a huge natural gas boiler

598
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,840
where you burn natural gas to create

599
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,159
Heating and you distribute that to a ton

600
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,640
of buildings that has its limitations in

601
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,240
the long run due to what we said earlier

602
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,240
that if you want to Electrify your

603
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,720
heating you're stuck to a natural gas

604
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,840
boiler so there was less appetite to say

605
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,960
hey how about we are exploring getting

606
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
heat pumps for everybody because that

607
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,320
would undermine the financial model of

608
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,240
the of the utility now interestingly

609
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,080
that actually changed uh pretty

610
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,520
dramatically in the last year this was a

611
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:59,279
central European um City because uh of

612
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,279
the unfor warn Ukraine there not enough

613
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,320
natural gas anymore so now it's uh it's

614
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:08,320
an interesting we come out of

615
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,000
availability necessity yeah and so I I

616
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,880
know like a key limitation even Beyond

617
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,640
you know the city level is that for many

618
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,720
different Clean Energy Technologies and

619
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,640
policies is just getting that buy in

620
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,279
from consumers can you speak a bit about

621
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,559
how you took this into account for your

622
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,399
research and for ubam doio yeah the B is

623
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,640
absolutely key and in our first

624
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,960
iteration of the tool and this is what

625
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,640
we've been talking about we focused on

626
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,760
the kind of technical potential if you

627
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,600
do certain things how much can you

628
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,559
reduce carbon but of course you have to

629
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,360
very very quickly people are not

630
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,640
interested in kilowatt hours people

631
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,320
might be interested in carbon people are

632
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,520
interested in money so without uh

633
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,200
putting some D tax and payback uh

634
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,760
numbers to this analysis that's

635
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,559
very the analysis won't get you very

636
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,000
so we have been working on models just

637
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,720
to estimate costs involved and this is a

638
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,200
complicated moment uh right now to

639
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,760
evaluate because we are trying to ramp

640
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,520
up this retrofitting activity so fast

641
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,279
that our labor force is lacking behind

642
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,679
we just don't have enough people that

643
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,640
put in these Technologies right now in

644
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,399
many parts of the US and I would say in

645
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,000
the world and that of course lead to

646
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:30,520
Adit to shortterm distortions because

647
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
the few people that are able to do that

648
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,720
are overwork and that drives up highs uh

649
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,880
but I think that we can understand how

650
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,559
this develops in the long run so then

651
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,200
the final component is where we've been

652
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,960
working on through the MIT energy

653
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,919
initiative with some uh Utility Partners

654
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,399
here that we started to work on

655
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,080
willingness to pay model so that's where

656
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:57,120
we ask people uh how are you willing to

657
00:27:53,080 --> 00:28:01,640
pay $500 $1,000 5,000 25

658
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,760
$50,000 to upgrade your home and how

659
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,440
much would you expect to save each month

660
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,039
what is the uh the payback time and we

661
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,519
asked to several thousand people

662
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,240
including knowing how much they care for

663
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,080
the environment

664
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,559
self-reported like General income level

665
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,120
ownership of the building and so forth

666
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,720
so that has actually greatly helped us

667
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,640
to have now this we call it the Deon no

668
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,320
Deon model we we at least know when

669
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,080
people say oh it's too expensive for me

670
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,480
like you probably have two-thirds of

671
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,200
people when you tell them uh would you

672
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,000
spend $50,000 to upgrade your building

673
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,200
they're just going to say no that number

674
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,919
is just I'm not interested so that helps

675
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:50,919
us kind of lay out this this complex uh

676
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,720
um relationship between how much do I do

677
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,000
people care how much money do they make

678
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,399
what do they expect so that we can start

679
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,880
fine-tuning incentives better right now

680
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,559
is um to kind of get this retrofitting

681
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,080
Market rolling in the US there are a lot

682
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,519
of pretty blanket pretty high

683
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,760
incentives and in a way this is similar

684
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,240
to what we've done through photo

685
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,279
voltaics they were really heavily

686
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,200
subsidized at the beginning to get a lot

687
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,120
of people to get Buy in and then we're

688
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,120
slowly tuning down the support because

689
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,760
we know that technology gets more

690
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,640
efficient that works to a degree now the

691
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,600
question is how much how fast can we get

692
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,279
lower

693
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,919
there's of course also an unintended

694
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:35,080
consequence that when you do that you

695
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,039
tend to um get higher income household

696
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,600
to do this first if everybody gets the

697
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,720
same money the person who has more money

698
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,200
is more likely to say yes because for

699
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,240
them it's a smaller commitment to

700
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,840
certain things so the questions of

701
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,519
equity and how we have to break this

702
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,360
down this is really where our activities

703
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,399
are currently at to just help cities to

704
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,760
understand these relationships better

705
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
well so and I know MIT right now is

706
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,960
actually currently retof fitting the

707
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,000
Metropolitan storage Warehouse which for

708
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,640
those familiar with the MIT campus is

709
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,399
the huge Warehouse on the corner of

710
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,399
massav and Vasser Street um it's an

711
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,320
iconic Cambridge building it opened in

712
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,600
1895 as a storage facility it's now

713
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,840
being renovated to house MIT School of

714
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,960
Architecture and planning have you

715
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,039
played any role in this project or your

716
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,240
model a role in the sense that of course

717
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,399
as MIT faculty we all try to be very

718
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,559
involved in and to my old that here with

719
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,279
several colleagues we've been involved

720
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,000
in the architectural process and trying

721
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,640
to give our advice with the

722
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Uber software or Uber no I'm going to

723
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,600
say U uh

724
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,720
the the uh the UB software is really for

725
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,399
larger scale so we would use what I

726
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,960
mentioned earlier the bem the building

727
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,080
energy modeling software to look at that

728
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,440
building specifically and a lot of this

729
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,360
uh work has happened using these tools

730
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,519
for this building I would say well

731
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,679
larger scale work really came in is

732
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,279
thinking about the development of the

733
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:09,039
electric Rd so right now MIT is very

734
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:12,880
similar to a lot of uh emphasis in the

735
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,559
Northeast is that we are using natural

736
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,720
gas with um with a complicated campus

737
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,000
utility plant to

738
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,080
create uh heating chilled water and our

739
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,039
own

740
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,559
electricity and that has been one of the

741
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:34,679
drivers for decarbonizing the Grits

742
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,600
generally in nor New England and it is

743
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,559
also economically a a good model which

744
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,679
is why a lot of campuses are are doing

745
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:45,760
that now we are at this interesting fine

746
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,799
moment where fortunately we are pushing

747
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,840
so much renewable energy that we are

748
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,960
soon reaching the point at which

749
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,639
actually the electric grd the grd the

750
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,799
public GD in Massachusetts might be

751
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:00,919
cleaner than our own Electric

752
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,440
and for us at a school of architecture

753
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,639
that was really really important we

754
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,360
didn't want to move in a building that

755
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:09,360
is basically dependent on a source that

756
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,360
might not per se have an immediate

757
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,039
future so there was a lot of lobbying on

758
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,279
our behalf to say well we would really

759
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,880
like to have an all El electric ready

760
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:24,200
campus buil and that is not necessarily

761
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,480
the most economic decision but it's a

762
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,840
future and uh it has was actually a

763
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,080
fabulous experience that um you know our

764
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,600
facilities onland campus uh the

765
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,840
administration everybody was really

766
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,559
receptive to the arguments that we made

767
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,320
and in a way uh committed to spending

768
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,720
more so what we are doing right now is

769
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,679
that might be a little complicated it's

770
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,679
for a physicist a really beautiful thing

771
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,760
so what we are doing we we are

772
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,559
basically on our campus we have two

773
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,600
Loops we have one loop with hot water

774
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,120
and one with chilled water and every

775
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,799
building just comes in and takes

776
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,639
whatever they they need right and so

777
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,679
what we are doing is we're using what is

778
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,919
called a water source heat bump in that

779
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:12,320
building so we are taking the cold water

780
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,840
that all buildings share and we make it

781
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,039
colder and that colder that heat we are

782
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,919
using to heat our building so the

783
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:25,000
Metropolitan Warehouse will be heated by

784
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,360
making the chilled water chilia coder on

785
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,159
campus which which is cool as a idea

786
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,600
it's a very efficient idea it also kind

787
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,399
of ties us on as a campus more together

788
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,639
physically speaking so there are a lot

789
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,080
of ideas of basically having these Grand

790
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:42,159
Loops that start connecting buildings

791
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,480
and the buildings take and give from it

792
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,039
heat in order to benefit from this so

793
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,360
this is something that uh that we've

794
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,039
been fortunate all as a team to uh get

795
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,880
implemented right now in the building

796
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:55,600
we're really excited about that and it

797
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,799
has direct carbon savings for the

798
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,240
buildings I think it was an extra 15% of

799
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,159
the over T were safe to that and it's

800
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,000
also something that I would think that

801
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,200
was um motivated through this work I'm

802
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,879
thinking our cities the campus is like a

803
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,119
mini City so that help so to close I

804
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,079
want to ask a fun question um if you

805
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,480
could become an expert in anything

806
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,839
instantly download all the skills and

807
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,320
knowledge instantly into your head even

808
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:26,200
if it's not related to what you're doing

809
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,280
now what would it be if I if I'm selfish

810
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,839
I think the most exciting Fe field if I

811
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,720
wanted to just learn something from

812
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,639
completely new right now it probably

813
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,320
would be biochemistry and Gene

814
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:43,359
sequencing I think the co pandemic

815
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,280
taught us just how incredibly our

816
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,079
advances have been in the field given

817
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,800
that the technology for the vaccine was

818
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,720
we in principle available that we could

819
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,760
do this so I think it's an incredibly

820
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,400
exciting field and my daughter enters

821
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,240
into this field where now and this is

822
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,560
one of the topics where I always feel

823
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,280
completely

824
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,320
ignorant and so I think it's an exciting

825
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,680
new feeli that I would probably where I

826
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,480
see a lot of innovation coming up next

827
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,119
uh otherwise when I look at something

828
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,000
that is kind of related to what I'm

829
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,400
doing maybe I would want to become like

830
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,720
an influencer YouTuber because I think

831
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,200
if you want to

832
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,400
really get to a lot of people and get

833
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,839
them exciting about retrofitting that we

834
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,800
me need the Mar Roba type skills I think

835
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,880
to make building science is already a

836
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
little out of the basement of nobody

837
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,079
caring about building science but we

838
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,640
still have to bring it more make it a

839
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,760
part of the public

840
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,440
imagination I love that answer Kristoff

841
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,880
thank you so much for speaking with me

842
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,359
today thank you that was a lot of fun

843
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,800
great thank you and to our listeners

844
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,560
thank you for joining I am Kelly Travers

845
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,560
