1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,293
I was born in Turkey in 1967.

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,631
I grew up in a middle-class family.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,674
My mother was a

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,426
teacher and school principal,

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,969
and my father was a

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,513
university lecturer and a lawyer.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,014
Since there were no video games,

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,559
I guess I had wide-ranging interests.

9
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,688
I was interested in some sorts of sports,

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,106
so I wasn't very good at it.

11
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,150
I was interested in cartoons and reading.

12
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,240
When I was quite young,

13
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,284
as I had just started middle school,

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,870
Turkey experienced a military coup,

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,121
and that kindled my

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,831
interest in issues of politics

17
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,624
and their relationship to economics,

18
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,084
and those were actually quite formative,

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,170
because they are the

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,171
topics that I still research.

21
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,258
These were turbulent times in Turkey.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,676
The military coup was

23
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,927
still unexpected for most,

24
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,262
and it was a bit of a shock,

25
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,638
because the democratic

26
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,891
government that was in place

27
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,352
was toppled, and suddenly

28
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,771
there were greater controls

29
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,897
and soldiers everywhere.

30
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,317
So it was an experience for all of us.

31
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,363
That was what drew me to social science

32
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,908
and drew me to academia

33
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,326
in the first place, indeed.

34
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,913
So I finished my high school in Turkey,

35
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,207
but after that I left

36
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,833
Turkey and I went to the UK.

37
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,709
I did my undergraduate

38
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,461
studies at the University of York,

39
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,505
and one of the reasons for that was there

40
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,840
was very little academic freedom

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,716
or freedom of speech

42
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,675
in Turkish University,

43
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,969
and I wanted to really

44
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,888
delve into these topics in a way

45
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,764
that I thought would not

46
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,391
restrict my freedom of inquiry,

47
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,311
and that was one of the critical things

48
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,271
that made me decide to look abroad.

49
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,399
It was natural for anybody

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,735
who was sort of up and coming

51
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,403
and had some ambition to

52
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,530
also think about the U.S.,

53
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,405
which was the center

54
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,365
of gravity of economics

55
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,701
and where academic conditions and various

56
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,119
things were much better.

57
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,579
So I actually applied

58
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,331
to the U.S. for jobs

59
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,708
and came and gave some job

60
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,335
talks and got an offer from MIT

61
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,086
and a few other places,

62
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,295
and I decided to come to MIT.

63
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,716
I mean, I think MIT

64
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,884
was at the time viewed

65
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,511
and is still the best

66
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,387
economics department.

67
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,013
You don't have,

68
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,223
especially as a junior faculty,

69
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,851
many burdens or red tape or

70
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,394
other things that detain you

71
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,063
from pursuing your passions and learning.

72
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,943
My passion has been about understanding

73
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,445
long-run economic growth,

74
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,446
what makes some countries

75
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,698
rich, some countries poor,

76
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,908
and especially thinking

77
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,661
about the role of technology

78
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,372
and what shapes

79
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,082
technology in that process,

80
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,292
as well as the

81
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,169
historical roots of that process.

82
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,047
Oh, I think, I mean, I'm

83
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,507
extremely grateful to MIT.

84
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,135
It's been an amazing journey for me.

85
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,220
I've learned a lot from my colleagues.

86
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,555
I always tell people I

87
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,806
finished my PhD at the LSC,

88
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,640
and then I came to MIT

89
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,933
and I did a second PhD here.

90
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,519
The more I have experience

91
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,521
with different corners of MIT,

92
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,648
both in terms of their research and in

93
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,066
terms of their commitment

94
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,403
to academic excellence and student

95
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,155
welfare and student learning,

96
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,364
I'm very, very impressed always.
