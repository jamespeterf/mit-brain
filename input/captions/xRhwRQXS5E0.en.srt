1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,599
Without further ado, I will invite Jose

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:16,640
Pacco, co-director of the Advanced

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:22,920
Manufacturing and Design Program of MIT,

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,920
Jose, the floor is yours. Good morning.

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,560
In antoasta, they told me that in

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,079
Santiago, people were more energetic.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,520
Good morning. Okay,

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,480
my name is Jose Pateco, co-director of

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,719
the advanced manufacturing and design

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,760
program of MIT. It is a pleasure to be

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:49,360
here. Let me warn you firstly and also

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,960
apologize. I am a Mexican, but I have

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,600
been in the USA for 45 years and I don't

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,280
have the chance to practice my Spanish

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,879
often. So once in a while I will use a

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,040
word in English or spang English

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,680
or I will invent a word. If I invent a

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,920
word and offend somebody, my apologies

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,920
for that.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,799
You came here to hear

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,960
my colleague Brian Anthony.

22
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:28,400
Unfortunately, he could not come. But I

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,159
have had the chance and honor to work

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,079
with Brian in the last 13 years also as

25
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,560
a co-director

26
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
of the advanced manufacturing and design

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,600
program.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,280
He's not here. I am here. Maybe he's a

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,759
more fit, taller.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,040
However, I think we are handsome, the

31
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,439
two of us. Okay, let's talk about

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,479
technologies.

33
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,000
That's why you're here. So I will start

34
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,000
immediately talking about

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
technologies

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
and how they connect to enable

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,160
innovation.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,920
My first topic is the concept of

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
tomography.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
Tomography

41
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,080
is

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,959
a difficult word. Somehow

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,879
it is about creating an image in 3D, a

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,080
3D image for anything.

45
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,959
I'm sure you've seen this in movies

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,959
where you are looking at something that

47
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,800
is uh internal then it is opened and

48
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,360
that is the concept how to build 3D

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,760
images using different technologies that

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,360
is tomography.

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,560
I will show you the beginning the

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,319
inception of a technology

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,200
>> that we are developing in the in Brian's

54
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,280
laboratory.

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,519
Let me show you this because sometimes

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,640
we think that advanced technologies are

57
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:17,040
originated already advanced and very

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:22,560
pretty but the truth is that they are

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:26,319
started as ideas. Let's imagine imagine

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,159
this. Let's imagine that we can use the

61
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:34,480
concept of ultrasound

62
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:39,120
through X-rays. Well, that's interesting

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,680
or laser. How can we test that idea?

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,440
The first test

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,319
was done here in a

66
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
cast of gel

67
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,400
with

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,400
iron pieces.

69
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,640
It looks like a

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
jelly, but you cannot eat it because it

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,159
has iron inside. Okay, but this is the

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,959
model. We would like to see the

73
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:13,120
differences between the jelly and the

74
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,760
bone and the ironon pieces to simulate

75
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,120
the differences

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,120
in the tissue of humans.

77
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,680
The purpose of this concept of real time

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,520
tomography needs to consider different

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,759
characteristics

80
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,800
of what we are looking at including

81
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,240
roughness of the surface.

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Acoustic attenuation

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,120
imagine

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,759
that's my favorite word imagine. so much

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,560
that sometimes I am introducing myself

86
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,199
to somebody and I say Jose

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,240
and somebody says no he's not Jose he's

88
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,479
imagine okay let's imagine that you have

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,479
a laser

90
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,840
into the tissue

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,240
this laser penetrates

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,080
the skin

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,080
heating the skin by doing that it

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,720
creates creates

95
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,960
a sound, an acoustic wave that we cannot

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,080
hear with our ears, but we can anyhow

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,080
we do that

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,120
and we have here a sample. This is part

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,560
of how you develop things. We started

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,800
with the jelly. Now we are moving to

101
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:50,080
this sample. We have a detector laser

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,680
here that will give us some ideas about

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,919
how we can see this image inside the

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,199
sample.

105
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,919
Here you can see the ultrasound image

106
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,280
without much detail.

107
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,319
However, here you can see the ultrasound

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,759
image with light.

109
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,880
You can see how different they are.

110
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,120
You can see the different parts of the

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
tissue

112
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,479
where we

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,319
can see the graph or we can see this

114
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,360
image. How does it work?

115
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,520
The sample moves

116
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,319
based on the laser on this platform

117
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:41,520
because we are heating the surface with

118
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:45,680
that laser with a pulse of 10 hertz.

119
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:49,440
The optical exposure during measurement

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,639
will use an intererometer to measure the

121
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,160
vibration on the different rough

122
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,039
surfaces.

123
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,039
How do we do that?

124
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:07,520
This is only possible. Oh, before going

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,520
there, imagine that we can use the same

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,520
concept

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,960
to see if a rock has copper inside.

128
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
This was part of a conversation that we

129
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
had some days ago. And I said, hm,

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
that's interesting. Maybe there is a

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,280
possibility to do that. We'll see. Okay,

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,199
how can we do that? Maybe in the future

133
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,680
even more.

134
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,479
Applying this concept of photonic

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,919
integrated circuits. What's this?

136
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,319
Photonic integrated circuits

137
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,520
are a combination of an integrated

138
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,759
circuit as the one you can see to the

139
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,080
left.

140
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,639
This is what you

141
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,560
regularly have seen inside your

142
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,919
computers, your iPhones with a power

143
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,840
supply source, transistors, resistors,

144
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,720
capacitors among others.

145
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,800
What is equivalent in a photonic

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
integrated circuit is that instead of

147
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,639
using electricity,

148
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,639
the system will use light.

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,840
These are wave guides, lasers, source,

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,840
detectors, etc. These elements are

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,160
combined to create the photonic

152
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,160
integrated circuit. They are really

153
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,560
really small

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
because today we have the chance to

155
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,640
build

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,640
the circuits

157
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,160
at nano scales.

158
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,360
So when you do that at that scale,

159
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,880
you lower the cost of the sensors and

160
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,000
this is very important because these

161
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,959
technologies have been

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,440
around for many years

163
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,320
but the manufacturing

164
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,600
of these elements

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,320
in small sizes reduces the cost so they

166
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,200
become more affordable.

167
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,000
So we have this concept. This is an

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,160
idea. We're testing it. We have access

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,680
to this tool. That's how we can measure

170
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,320
this.

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,320
What can we do with this technology?

172
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,240
I started thinking.

173
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:39,680
I don't have a mining background but at

174
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,440
the same time I have learned a lot here.

175
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,040
And

176
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,320
with AMSA we have talked about

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,040
structural monitoring of tunnels

178
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,320
and shafts. Imagine

179
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,040
how we can reduce

180
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,920
the risks of collapse.

181
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:08,240
Secondly, we can characterize the ore

182
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,600
as we saw in that uh slide. And thirdly,

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,800
the inspection of critical equipment in

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,320
operation. This is something that we

185
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,320
already do in manufacturing.

186
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,519
In this case, we can do that to look at

187
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:31,600
heavy equipment to detect internal

188
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:34,880
cracks, corrosion before failure occurs.

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,200
>> Yes, there is a possibility to do this.

190
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,519
We are just imagining

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,120
things so far. Let me give you an

192
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:49,040
example of innovation in real time

193
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:54,320
echoing the words that were said before.

194
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,839
Innovation is a joint community work. I

195
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,160
arrived

196
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,160
on Monday.

197
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:08,600
We had our first presentation. And I had

198
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,600
the honor to visit a mine site sentella

199
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,760
and by learning

200
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,480
so many things I was asked can we use

201
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,200
this technology to characterize the or

202
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,160
in a non-destructive manner. I said, "I

203
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,839
don't know. Maybe. Let's see." Last

204
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,240
night, I Whatsopped my students and

205
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,680
said, "Imagine

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,360
that we want to characterize an or

207
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,720
nondestructively.

208
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,600
What should we do?" Well, firstly, we

209
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,200
have to analyze whether it is possible

210
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,800
to do it in the lab or not. Secondly, we

211
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,800
should imagine and see

212
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:57,839
if the model makes business sense. Here

213
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,200
we have sorting. This is a process that

214
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,560
already exists in the mind.

215
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:09,600
Automatic sorting. And I learned that

216
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,600
these belts go really fast. So, how can

217
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
we

218
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,360
use this technology

219
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,639
at such a fast rate.

220
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,079
So yesterday when I was on the site, one

221
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,639
of the workers said, you know, we can

222
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,639
have different belts

223
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:40,800
running at a lower rate,

224
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,839
then we can merge them to gain speed. So

225
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,800
that's interesting. We are innovating.

226
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,519
We are figuring things out.

227
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,720
An innovation

228
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,519
it is important to do that. So as I said

229
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,399
I sent a WhatsApp message to the

230
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,040
students and I said can we do this? What

231
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:06,320
do you think? They replied and uh we had

232
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,760
a quick FaceTime and we said you know

233
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,760
what I don't know if it is possible but

234
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:18,200
there is already a technology called PG

235
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,200
NAA and PFTNAS

236
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,839
prompt gamma neutral activation analysis

237
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,519
and what I said is what you are thinking

238
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,480
of of course there is a technology why

239
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,200
didn't I think of that

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,160
and I said okay give me a second because

241
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,560
I have to look at something then chat

242
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,720
GPT

243
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,120
now I really understand what chat GPT is

244
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,120
this is

245
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,560
immediate gamma rays uh neutronic

246
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,440
activation analysis and the neut thermal

247
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,480
neutron ronic activation

248
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,320
of PFT

249
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:13,279
NA. Interesting. We started with a jelly

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,399
with iron and we are ending up here. How

251
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:21,600
can we use new technology

252
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,680
to detect and create 3D images

253
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
faster?

254
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,959
And I said, "Wow, this is interesting.

255
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,079
What what should we do to get there?

256
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,320
It is interesting to see that there is a

257
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:39,920
company that is using this technology

258
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:43,199
already. They are testing it. Therefore,

259
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,519
here you can see

260
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,519
how

261
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:55,199
this technology may be used. So

262
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:59,360
our work as researchers is changing.

263
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,639
the starting point changes.

264
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,880
Okay, this already exists. There are

265
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,880
people looking at the possibilities. We

266
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,440
had to pilot the solution and see how

267
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,279
the solution connects to other

268
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,079
possibilities or areas. But

269
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,680
you are detecting things through

270
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,079
sorting.

271
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,480
Then you can see how to process the

272
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,480
volume differently. This is part of

273
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
innovation.

274
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,360
I couldn't be talking about this if I

275
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,760
hadn't visited the mine and if I hadn't

276
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,880
proposed what we proposed in the

277
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,680
beginning. So the end will be a

278
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,920
combination of what we have seen maybe

279
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,880
something new maybe other students in

280
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,000
the future will say you know what we can

281
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,839
do this and this is how the concept of

282
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,120
innovation moves on that's the first

283
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,079
technology the second technology is

284
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,079
about digital twins

285
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,519
they are used already here what I saw in

286
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,800
Santella

287
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:17,959
is that this is the technological

288
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,959
foundation of the future of mining.

289
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:30,000
>> Not only for mining but also

290
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:33,040
for tangible jobs of the future.

291
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,120
Digital twins

292
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,440
have been

293
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,199
here

294
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,720
for a long time. They have been

295
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,759
implemented in several industries. A

296
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:52,320
digital twin is a virtual replication of

297
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,440
an object, process or physical system in

298
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,160
maybe an engine,

299
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,560
a factory or a city. This is very

300
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,799
important.

301
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:09,520
I have um colleagues in media lab. They

302
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:12,480
have a digital twin for

303
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,959
Andor a country. Do you know where Andor

304
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,760
is?

305
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,559
Well, these are my optical sensors as

306
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,959
you can see

307
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,600
and they are working.

308
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,600
>> Okay. And Pandora

309
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,360
is a very small country between France

310
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,360
and Spain.

311
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,280
In the lab, there is a digital twin of

312
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,480
the country.

313
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,360
Authorities can make decisions

314
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,919
based on the infrastructure

315
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,640
and they

316
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:57,200
can also receive real time data

317
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,960
to update the model

318
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,880
permanently.

319
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:08,280
Therefore, this is what

320
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,280
turns a model into a digital twin.

321
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:17,919
If you have uh children or maybe you

322
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,320
have played this game where you are

323
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,320
driving in a race, a car race, but it's

324
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,000
the model, right? Let's imagine imagine

325
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,760
again

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:37,679
that this video game receives updated

327
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:40,880
data of a car race connected to the car

328
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,520
of your favorite driver. You can see the

329
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,640
temperature of the tires

330
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,120
of the road, the engine, the level of

331
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,400
fuel, etc.

332
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,799
That combination, the model plus the

333
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,240
update

334
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,240
will become a digital twin

335
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,559
and there are different tastes of

336
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,559
digital twins.

337
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:20,880
Normally these are models created first

338
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:24,480
as the one for this car race game

339
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,160
it derives from physics.

340
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,960
So

341
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:34,960
when we do this we know why the car goes

342
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,080
that way because of the way in which we

343
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,120
have programmed the model derived from

344
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,080
physics. On the other end, we have

345
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,039
something very popular

346
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,919
which is the use of data

347
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,280
to program AI,

348
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,480
machine language

349
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,480
to create the model, but we don't know

350
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,480
why

351
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
this is not derived from physics. And

352
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,000
then we have the hybrid combination in

353
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,000
the middle.

354
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:17,120
This concept of digital twins is not a

355
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,559
new thing because

356
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,200
we have been doing this for years. This

357
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,320
is the science of measurement and

358
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,320
applied simulation.

359
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
However,

360
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,000
data update

361
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,960
is only possible here. We because we

362
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,640
have new sensors. That is part of our

363
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,280
job. That is part of what is changing

364
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:51,200
the world and the way in which we work.

365
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:56,960
Today we can create new sensors

366
00:20:51,200 --> 00:21:02,120
in such a way of high scalability with a

367
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,120
very high low cost.

368
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,159
Another colleague is looking at the

369
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:12,480
possibility of creating sensors that are

370
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:16,799
like powder, like dust

371
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,480
that can be spread on

372
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,480
an area to measure temperature,

373
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,480
humidity,

374
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,760
to see how much water can be irrigated

375
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,880
to a park. For instance,

376
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,640
with the combination of new sensors, we

377
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,640
can see a change in the trends.

378
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,080
This is what we have done for 100 years.

379
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,200
We had we used to have statistical

380
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,880
process control. We have a more digital

381
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,080
way of doing things. Now, in the last 15

382
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,960
years, we have developed the concept of

383
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,200
models and now digital twins. But what's

384
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,720
next?

385
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,720
The concept of the digital twin

386
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,919
could be merged with more intelligence.

387
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,640
We are connecting digital twins with

388
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,679
artificial intelligence

389
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,120
and that is what we're doing now. But in

390
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,440
the future, we will be able to do

391
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,400
something more interesting. And in fact,

392
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,720
this is already taking place. Some

393
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,400
colleagues are using this here in the

394
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,880
live stream. Probably they know what I'm

395
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,159
going to explain now. This is the

396
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,799
cognitive digital twin model. This is

397
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:45,480
the moment and the future.

398
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,480
A cognitive digital twin.

399
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,799
If we think of the overall general twin

400
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:00,960
digital twin, this is a mirror without a

401
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:04,640
brain. Now we connect it to AI

402
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,640
and we infuse capabilities that are very

403
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,360
interesting and key. For instance,

404
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,360
perception and attention.

405
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:19,640
Perception is about sensors. attention

406
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,640
is about machine learning

407
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:28,640
also memory and learning.

408
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:32,640
One of the main challenges that we face

409
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,720
is that we have too much data.

410
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,440
These systems at present

411
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,360
don't have the capability to filter

412
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,039
irrelevant data by themselves.

413
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,320
As human beings, we do that immediately,

414
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,320
easily. However,

415
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360
we should infuse

416
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,000
AI with the capability to filter

417
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,000
irrelevant data.

418
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,880
And then

419
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,320
we could use memory and learning in

420
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,520
these models learning continuously from

421
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,520
history data in real time. I think this

422
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,120
is fascinating.

423
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,080
The models are being improved because

424
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,880
they learn from history data. This is

425
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,720
what we have seen and we continue to see

426
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,919
in our daily lives with Chad GBT and

427
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,120
Gemini. This is improving

428
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:39,840
day by day.

429
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,640
What we see in the LLMs

430
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,600
is totally different from what we see

431
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,640
today if we compare that to 18 months

432
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,520
ago. Of course, there are things that

433
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,840
still need to be changed. But here we've

434
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,919
come to something really interesting.

435
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:02,400
Reasoning and problem solving.

436
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:06,799
If we ask chat GPT

437
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,080
what should I do based on this data

438
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,600
chat GPT will provide a solution.

439
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,240
However the next question should be why

440
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,840
imagine we can do that with the digital

441
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,720
twins

442
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:28,720
that are updated with this data

443
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:31,039
and AI. So digital twins could give us a

444
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,760
suggestion

445
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,760
on how we can improve operations

446
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:45,600
and they can do that in a collaborative

447
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:50,159
manner. Then again maybe you have tested

448
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:53,039
this with J Gemini particularly or Siri.

449
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,880
We can have a conversation

450
00:25:53,039 --> 00:26:00,159
not only through AI but also

451
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,240
a conversation with the system in

452
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,679
operation. This is something totally

453
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,000
different. This is not with a model. It

454
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,000
is a conversation with a system of

455
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,799
operation with the context that has been

456
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,240
trained on that context. It is a

457
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:22,960
different way of working and we have

458
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,279
come to the future with this

459
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,400
capabilities of perception, attention,

460
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:32,720
memory, reasoning, problem solving and

461
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:36,240
collaboration in the digital twins. We

462
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,200
have cognitive digital twins.

463
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,120
Essentially, if a traditional digital

464
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,480
twin tells you what is going on when you

465
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,880
add cognition,

466
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,039
you can see

467
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,080
why this is happening, what will happen

468
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,400
in the future and what you should do

469
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,400
about it.

470
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,480
Something changes

471
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,279
when that happens and that is what we

472
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,320
see today.

473
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,679
AI models, LLMs

474
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,919
are learning from us. What we have

475
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,679
written in the past, what we continue to

476
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,640
write, with the videos that we upload to

477
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,480
YouTube, with the books we write, the

478
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,480
models are learning from us. But today

479
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,760
with this concept with this

480
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,240
collaboration that is more natural we

481
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:39,200
are starting to learn more and better

482
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:42,000
with them. So this becomes co-learning

483
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,600
a very interesting co-learning with a

484
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,159
context

485
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,880
that is real in front of us. It is

486
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:55,039
immediate. We know that learning

487
00:27:50,880 --> 00:28:00,880
is easier and better when we don't have

488
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:03,520
to imagine things. How will I use this?

489
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,000
Now we have things in front of our eyes

490
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,320
and we can ask ourselves what would

491
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:15,120
happen if or imagine if

492
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:19,840
I change this if I change that.

493
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:24,080
So that is the future digital trend.

494
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,559
Thirdly, this concept of process

495
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,240
improvement,

496
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:35,279
something that already exists that we

497
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,600
have uh managed very well in the last 50

498
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,200
years with the lean system, the Toyota

499
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,480
production system that has applied to

500
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
has been applied to different

501
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,799
industries.

502
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,200
With new sensors, we have the cognitive

503
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,559
digital twins

504
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,559
and they are trained

505
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,120
on data of our processes.

506
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,120
So

507
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,520
by asking ourselves what would happen if

508
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,120
we can come

509
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,799
to the application of the digital twin

510
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:24,080
to an NG. Nissan

511
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:26,559
for a long time has uh

512
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,159
wanted to create a variable compression

513
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,840
system

514
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,320
engine.

515
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,120
very difficult to do but very

516
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:41,520
interesting. They were able to do that

517
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:45,919
because Nissan has a digital model.

518
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:50,000
They started to iterate by doing that.

519
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:53,120
Why is this so important?

520
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,120
If you have a variable compression

521
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,120
engine,

522
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:05,399
you can determine if you want more power

523
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,399
or more efficiency in real time.

524
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,000
So

525
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:16,240
this is only possible

526
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,760
because we have these new ways of

527
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,000
co-learning

528
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,480
with the new models. And what can we do

529
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,600
with that? Imagine

530
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,440
that we can use the same technologies

531
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,760
to improve

532
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,760
what we already have on the field.

533
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,679
Electric generators with fuel

534
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,559
flexibility.

535
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,679
When designing a generator, that

536
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,480
generator is designed for a particular

537
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:53,840
fuel like diesel. But in the future we

538
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:56,720
have nitrogen or ox or hydrogen.

539
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,279
That depends on the compression system.

540
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,159
So maybe we can extend the life cycle of

541
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:09,840
that uh generator with a lower cost with

542
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:12,640
a new fuel or we can reduce the energy

543
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,279
consumption of whole tracks. Autonomous

544
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,559
whole tracks. When they are loaded they

545
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:22,000
need more power. when they are unloaded

546
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,039
they are more efficient.

547
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,880
We can also apply that

548
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,880
to

549
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,679
the change of engines or motors in uh

550
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,840
shovels and drills

551
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:41,200
to provide performance or better

552
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:45,600
performance to a fleet that is operating

553
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:49,320
at a higher elevation. So we can start

554
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,320
looking at possibilities.

555
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,440
This is

556
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,519
connected progressively

557
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,519
in a way that is not just

558
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,519
technological.

559
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,399
I believe this is the key of innovation.

560
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,399
I gave you some ideas about

561
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,399
technologies.

562
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,159
Brian, Anthony, my colleague and others

563
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,679
are working on uh ideas that have

564
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,720
inspired others

565
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,799
with a context. In addition to the

566
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,679
context,

567
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:36,399
we are iterating things to reach a place

568
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,279
where we can say okay we should test

569
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,240
this. But

570
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:47,360
reaching that point

571
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:51,039
When you say okay we can conduct a test

572
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,039
is a process that is human

573
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,080
organizational

574
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,919
and also business related.

575
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,799
Not all companies, not all

576
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,039
social and technical

577
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:10,480
systems

578
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:12,000
have the same culture of experiencing

579
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,760
things,

580
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,360
testing things. This comes from the

581
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,279
culture

582
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,039
created within a company considering the

583
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,279
values.

584
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,279
In addition,

585
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,120
The processes are important. What will

586
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,760
your KPIs be? What are the measurement

587
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,440
systems to understand or know if the

588
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,159
system has improved, if uh humans have

589
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,640
improved

590
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,640
so that we can create digital twins for

591
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
organizations.

592
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,440
In addition to that, we have to change

593
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:02,320
the way in which we learn. When we put

594
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,799
all those factors together,

595
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,200
adding also some other concepts that we

596
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:12,079
are studying in terms of finance risks

597
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,079
and we combine that with technology,

598
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,079
engineering,

599
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:26,599
we can scale ideas that may start from a

600
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,599
jelly

601
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,399
with metal inside to what we are we have

602
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,919
in front of our eyes. We have to connect

603
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,919
all of that. This is not easy.

604
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,919
So part of my research is based on this

605
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,240
on escalation.

606
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,119
Thank you very much again. It's been a

607
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,079
pleasure to be here with you on behalf

608
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,079
of Brian Anthony as well. Thank you very

609
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,079
much.

610
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,000
on behalf of Brian Anthony

611
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,599
u who couldn't be here. Okay, now we

612
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,000
have a Q&A I guess. Thanks for your

613
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,599
interesting presentation. You have five

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
minutes

615
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,079
in your favor.

616
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,560
You were very efficient in your

617
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,040
presentation. But we have questions

618
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:28,800
because as I said we have a QR code and

619
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:33,040
you can post questions

620
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:37,200
for our speakers from the technical

621
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:42,240
desk. We have Rodrigo

622
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:46,599
asking the questions from the audience.

623
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,599
So let's start with the Q&A.

624
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,640
How are you integrating

625
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:07,079
digital twins

626
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,079
to these technological projects?

627
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,440
Well, that is exactly what we're trying

628
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,040
to do

629
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,680
>> in different industries and and in

630
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,480
different manners.

631
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,920
Now that we have this possibility to

632
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:30,960
create systems with which we can

633
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:35,359
interact in a more natural manner,

634
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:40,079
we can create a digital twin

635
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:43,640
but also subdigital twins

636
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,640
with the unit

637
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,920
in an organization.

638
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:57,880
You can build your models, your

639
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,880
concepts. You can do scenario planning.

640
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,320
When you do that modeling, you can also

641
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,520
put together all the outcomes. And this

642
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,400
is what we have been studying also. It

643
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,440
is a process of communication between

644
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,480
different units, different

645
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,280
uh organizations and that is what

646
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,000
innovation brings about. Instead of

647
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,760
focusing on the differences of our

648
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,040
functions

649
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,040
with advanced manufacturing,

650
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,079
we have differences in design and

651
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,839
production.

652
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:44,320
When we have this artifact as we call

653
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,560
it, we can focus on the concept itself,

654
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,880
not on the differences between a

655
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,800
designer and somebody in protection.

656
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,880
There is something that I would like to

657
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,400
add also. And we define advanced

658
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,640
manufacturing

659
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,640
in MIT.

660
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,440
We also you can see that this also

661
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,760
includes mining. For us manufacturing is

662
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,079
transformation and flow of material.

663
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,680
When considering that we can include

664
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,280
everything

665
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,079
from

666
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,880
the rock to the point of delivery of the

667
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,760
product to the consumer to the end

668
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,640
consumer and of course when it returns

669
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,240
to the system for recirculation or

670
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,640
recycling.

671
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,480
Yes, we have one more question.

672
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,359
Jose,

673
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,079
how can we efficiently manage the

674
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,960
portfolio of innovation when faced with

675
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,839
so many challenges and ensuring that the

676
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,240
project contributes to medium and

677
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,720
long-term goals?

678
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,079
That's a very good question and this is

679
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,720
where we come to the final part of my

680
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:07,119
presentation.

681
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:13,040
How can we simulate different systems

682
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:15,760
of measurement but not also measurement.

683
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,520
>> In recent years we have focused on key

684
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,680
on KPIs

685
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,520
the key performance indicators. We talk

686
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,040
about indicators.

687
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,720
So what we see today is that these are

688
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,839
not just indicators with a target but

689
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,880
there is a range. What can we do if we

690
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,560
change this indicator with another

691
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,320
indicator and how the outcome would

692
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,480
change? This is not

693
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,480
about

694
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,240
key performance indicators but key

695
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,160
performance indicator ranges.

696
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,800
Secondly,

697
00:39:52,160 --> 00:40:00,119
we need to open to the possibility

698
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,119
an opportunity

699
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:08,560
to our colleagues who are

700
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,200
building simulations and brainstorming

701
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,800
to communicate

702
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,800
that to the rest of the organization.

703
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,119
So key performance indicator instead of

704
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,240
key performance indicators, we should

705
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,240
have key performance simulators

706
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:31,599
so that they report new and better ways

707
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:36,560
to manage operations. Yes, KPIs I just

708
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:39,560
invented that uh uh concept.

709
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,560
So

710
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,680
you saw what I showed.

711
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,119
We should give uh the opportunity to our

712
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,000
colleagues to create simulations. You

713
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,359
saw that in real time with that. You saw

714
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,359
the images that didn't exist 24 hours

715
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,359
ago,

716
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,160
especially with the three

717
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,920
pictures of the stone

718
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,000
inside the mine and then in different

719
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,760
belts

720
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,920
with the use of AI.

721
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,440
I said, "Imagine

722
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,640
what could happen to help me imagine and

723
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,280
help communicate. This is a new

724
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,119
capability. How can we help our

725
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,000
colleagues use that capability

726
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,040
that changes and accelerates the way in

727
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,680
which we communicate and innovation of

728
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,640
course Jose it's been a pleasure to have

729
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,440
you here with us sharing your knowledge

730
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,480
and expertise and applause to Jose.

731
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,319
He said that people in their north were

732
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,640
more enthusiastic.

733
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,480
I will report to Antoagasta that they

734
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,200
were right.

735
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,200
Thank you very much.
