00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,480
hi I'm Richard rabbat I want everybody

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,639
to take a second close your eyes no no

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,440
cheating close your eyes and think about

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,520
your last week and think about like all

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,320
the stuff that you decided to accomplish

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,359
versus what you actually

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,160
accomplished now open all your

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,960
eyes

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,119
and and think about like what you could

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,119
have accomplished if there was a

11
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,840
companion an AI companion that could

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,320
help you that could be your Chief of

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,800
Staff your admin and that could help you

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,719
achieve more for yourself I'm Richard

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,360
Rabat I'm a PhD from MIT I was most

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,600
recently VP off product at Twitter

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,559
rebuilt to whole data in ml

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,800
platform when you look at AI most of the

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,520
systems that you look at CLA or chat GPT

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,359
all these systems they've been trained

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,320
all a lot of data that's available

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,879
publicly so they can like give you a lot

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,479
of information we've seen like some

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,880
amazing startups that are like you know

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,479
helping you like retrieve information

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,880
but like a lot of these systems are

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,240
actually not aware of like how you work

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,880
how your how your company organizes

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,400
itself what workflows actually work

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,320
meanwhile everybody is under pressure to

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,720
adopt AI because there's an IM immediate

32
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,479
need for bringing more productivity into

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,119
the

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,040
workplace so Li is an agentic AI so

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,960
basically it's something it's an AI that

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,560
does things and what it does is it

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,680
builds a we we build an Enterprise

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,600
specific

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,000
llm that can help you with all tasks

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,399
including onboarding planning coaching

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,719
scheduling task assignments tracking

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,719
your

43
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,759
okrs and we also do it in a personalized

44
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,640
way so that the AI actually like speaks

45
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,560
the language that you want and they you

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,200
know Converses with you in a way that

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:05,000
like you know makes you feel comfortable

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,840
here's an example of uh the AI basically

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,599
like helping you with scheduling a t

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,120
that actually take end ends up taking a

51
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,720
lot of interruptions of of your time

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,360
each of these interruptions typically

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,160
takes you about 20 minutes to like you

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,480
it takes you about 20 minutes to G coup

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,360
from that interruption in this case

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,239
basically ly just takes over the

57
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,720
conversation negotiates on your behalf

58
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,360
available time and then sets it up on

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,480
your calendar and it's

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,280
all basically powered by a knowledge

61
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,920
craft that captures you your relations

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
with other people and like the work that

63
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,680
you're doing and the the next thing that

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,560
happens is when when you do this when

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,680
the other person like you know is you

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,680
know gets the calendar entry done they

67
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,239
actually have a conversation they've

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,400
actually created the relationship with

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,560
the AI so it has a viral viral uh impact

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,519
as well here's your daily planner

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,840
typically you go into a me you know you

72
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,319
go into your day and you're like oh my

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,879
goodness like I had like a bunch of

74
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
meetings that I should have moved around

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,200
but like you know it's too late and here

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,560
like you know by liy like you know

77
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,879
coming and like giving you like the

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,560
information ahead of time you can say

79
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm just going to cancel you use like

80
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,519
natural language and like Li will just

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
do

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,760
it and

83
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,200
then at the end of the day all of us are

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,519
missing that capability that coaching

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,000
capability that we used to have in some

86
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,280
cases you're assigned an executive coach

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,640
you know you find your own mentors but

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,799
liy here like basically like looks at

89
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,400
like what you're spending time on and

90
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,680
like helps you reorganize against like

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,560
the goals and objectives that you said

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,040
in this case I said that I want to spend

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,159
more time on deep work and like Lighty

94
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,920
like gives me recommendations but by

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,439
looking at what my calendar looks like

96
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,360
and giving me uh insights into what is

97
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,159
what I should do so basically like

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,280
spending you know blocking more time to

99
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,079
do deep work canceling some meetings

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,120
that are too tactical

101
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,920
Etc and then finally like when you look

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,680
at like the uh you know every meeting

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,199
that you get get into but when you leave

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,120
when you leave that meeting some people

105
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,880
have taken notes they've they remember

106
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,040
some action items liy is much more

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,080
comprehensive it make sure that like all

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
the action items that were spoken about

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,440
are actually captured and then there's

110
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,039
follow follow through to the to you know

111
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,360
on on these action items and uh there's

112
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,840
typically a you know a bias when

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,759
somebody's taking notes because they

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,720
they just care about the things that are

115
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,720
that matter to them light is more

116
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,800
comprehensive it like picks on all the

117
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,479
pieces and make sure that they get

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,280
assigned and people like you know

119
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,039
progress on these tasks uh we're also

120
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,199
doing a production deployment with a

121
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,240
platform partner so it will be available

122
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,880
to hundreds of thousands of companies in

123
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,280
that case

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,000
uh we have a number of Pilots that we

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,160
that we've established and we would like

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,759
to work more with companies that want to

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,600
really improve how their teams work and

128
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,960
how they collaborate to be able to like

129
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,240
deliver more for themselves for their

130
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
teams and for their organization thank
