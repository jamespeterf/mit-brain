1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,070
- [Rachel] Hey, Joseph,
how excited are you

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,570
to answer 54 questions?

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,980
- Rachel, I'm super excited.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,270
- [Rachel] Can you introduce yourself?

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,860
- Yeah, so my name is Joseph Ravichandran.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,140
I'm a second-year PhD
student here at MIT-CSAIL,

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,250
studying computer science.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,510
- [Rachel] And what are you working on?

9
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,550
- So I work on computer
architectural security,

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,280
which means that I hack
CPUs at the Silicon level.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,540
- [Rachel] Now, when you tell people

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,390
you're a computer scientist,
what are their reactions?

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,590
- Honestly, most people want me to hack

14
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,330
their Facebook account.

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,000
- [Rachel] So you did expose
a security vulnerability

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
on Apple's M1 chip.

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,670
How did you do that?

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,710
- Yeah, so the way that
worked was we realized

19
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,120
that the Apple M1 supports this thing

20
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,770
called pointer authentication.

21
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,820
And so what we did is we thought,

22
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,770
if we were gonna make
this feature ourselves,

23
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,790
what mistakes might we make?

24
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,770
What flaws might we add to the system?

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,290
And we bought one of the M1s
and tested it for those flaws,

26
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,580
and we found that the mistake

27
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,560
that we envisioned was present.

28
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,790
- [Rachel] So how did you feel about

29
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,770
all of the coverage that this received?

30
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,530
- Yeah, so having the incredible
support of the community

31
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,240
really encouraged us to do future research

32
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,070
and made me just more
excited to keep working.

33
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,620
- [Rachel] So is Pacman
your favorite video game?

34
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,580
- It's definitely up there.

35
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,840
It's definitely one of the best.

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,180
- [Rachel] And what got
you interested in hacking?

37
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,980
- Yeah, so I grew up
making games in Unity,

38
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,440
and one day, I decided to
try to hack my own game.

39
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,170
Realized that it's very easy
to make insecure software,

40
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,760
and that kind of got me interested.

41
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,050
- [Rachel] And so what's
your favorite type

42
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,430
of challenge to hack?

43
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,110
- So I work on binary exploitation,

44
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,220
which means hacking programs

45
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,110
at the low-level assembly language.

46
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,970
- [Rachel] And how would
you describe ethical hacking

47
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,620
to a non-technical person?

48
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,630
- Yeah, so ethical hacking
means that I'm looking

49
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,360
for vulnerabilities in software
to disclose them responsibly

50
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,000
to the vendor, so that I get
there before the bad guy does.

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,530
- [Rachel] Who are some of
your favorite researchers

52
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,363
you've worked with?

53
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:37,320
- Yeah, one of my favorite
researchers to work with here

54
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,210
is my advisor, Menja Yen.

55
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,372
Oh, what's going on, Menja?

56
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,530
- How's the long summer.
Do students like it?

57
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,410
- Oh, it's been going
great. Everyone loves it.

58
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,510
- [Rachel] What's your favorite
hacking tool or software?

59
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,400
- It's a tool called
Ghidra that was released

60
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,590
by the NSA, and I use it
pretty much every day.

61
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,540
- [Rachel] Now, what's your
favorite MIT hacker prank

62
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,860
that's ever happened?

63
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,300
- Honestly, gotta be the cop car,

64
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,530
which is right up there actually.

65
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,810
And it's a classic, it's super cool.

66
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,643
- [Rachel] What's your process

67
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,240
for finding vulnerabilities in a system?

68
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,520
- Yeah, so there's really two
major approaches that I take.

69
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
The first is something called fuzzing,

70
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,420
where you kind of randomly
put inputs into a program

71
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,830
and just kind of see what breaks.

72
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,110
And the second is just
looking at the source code

73
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,420
and trying to figure out
what did the author miss,

74
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,920
what kinda mistakes might they have made?

75
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,390
- [Rachel] How do you balance
your hacking interests

76
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,060
with your academic responsibilities?

77
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,560
- Yeah, so luckily as a grad student,

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,290
most of my academic responsibilities
are hacking-related.

79
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,540
So I get all the hacking
I'd ever really want.

80
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,950
- [Rachel] What's the
most unexpected thing

81
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,000
you've learned from hacking?

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,650
- The most unexpected
thing I'd have to say

83
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,150
is just becoming very comfortable

84
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,070
as a beginner in new things.

85
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,270
So with hacking, a lot of the time,

86
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,140
you're a complete beginner,

87
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,660
starting with some new
technology you've never used.

88
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,550
And I found that the skill
actually transfers really well

89
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,920
to a lot of areas besides engineering.

90
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
- [Rachel] Common misconceptions?

91
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,950
- The biggest misconception
is that hacking

92
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,140
is an illegal act or criminal act.

93
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,450
Actually a lot of hacking
is done for ethical reasons

94
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,800
and actually helps keep you more secure,

95
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,690
like the hacking that we do here at MIT.

96
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,490
- [Rachel] So have you ever
taught anyone else to hack?

97
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,140
And how'd that go?
- Yeah, absolutely.

98
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,400
So if you wanna learn how to hack,

99
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,780
check out our course that we teach

100
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,240
that I helped design called
MIT Secure Hardware Design.

101
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,340
So go ahead and Google that
and you'll see the course.

102
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,260
- [Rachel] How would
you explain what you do

103
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,460
to a five-year-old?

104
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,320
- Hacking computers is
basically just tricking them

105
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,300
into doing something they
weren't supposed to do.

106
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,260
- [Rachel] Is there anything in this world

107
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,310
that's unhackable?

108
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,110
- So unfortunately I don't
think we're quite there yet

109
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,580
in terms of the defense technology.

110
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,707
We have plenty of innovation left to go.

111
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:22,590
In the meantime, it is kind
of fun taking the latest

112
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,480
defense innovations and
trying to break them.

113
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,580
- [Rachel] What's the coolest
thing you've ever hacked?

114
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,510
- Coolest thing I've ever hacked

115
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,340
has gotta be the Linux kernel.

116
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,050
- [Rachel] Any hacking
lingo you can teach us?

117
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,370
- Yeah, so I got two words for you.

118
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,310
The first is exploit, which
means to actually write a hack

119
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,540
for a system that makes it do something

120
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,800
it's not supposed to do.

121
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,680
The second is vuln, which
is short for vulnerability.

122
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,270
Vulnerabilities lead to exploits.

123
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,170
That's the part of the system

124
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,000
that's vulnerable to you hacking it.

125
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,160
- [Rachel] Are you always
interested in computer science?

126
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,870
- So I grew up learning
programming from YouTube

127
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,090
just watching YouTube videos,
and actually even started

128
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,430
my own YouTube channel to teach
programming to other people.

129
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,290
- [Rachel] So what was your
reaction when you received

130
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,970
the acceptance letter from MIT?

131
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,930
- Oh, I was super thrilled.

132
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,910
MIT's one of the best places
on earth to do research

133
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,290
and I'm super happy to be here.

134
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,760
- [Rachel] What was your first day like?

135
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,870
- It was pretty overwhelming.

136
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,520
I got to see the lab and meet my advisor

137
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,870
and meet all my new lab mates.

138
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,640
- [Rachel] And how would
you describe the community

139
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,630
here at CSAIL?

140
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,950
- Oh, it's absolutely world-class.

141
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,597
Like if you're interested
in some obscure technology

142
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:14,910
and you need an expert on that one thing,

143
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,830
there's definitely someone
here that knows that.

144
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,600
- [Rachel] Are you involved
in any clubs here at MIT?

145
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,030
- I actually just joined the
sport TaeKwonDo team here,

146
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,530
which has been a ton of fun.

147
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,880
There's really nothing
quite like getting kicked

148
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,330
in the stomach repeatedly
after a long day of research.

149
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,740
- [Rachel] Any prominent
figures in the field

150
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,670
who influenced you?

151
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,650
- I'm a big Steve Wozniak fan.

152
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,480
I was also really influenced by Zoz Brooks

153
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,940
and the greater DEFCON
community as a whole

154
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,320
as well as Palmer Luckey.

155
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,090
As a matter of fact, I was
actually one of the very first

156
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,370
Oculus Rift backers on Kickstarter.

157
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,690
- [Rachel] Hey, you recently gave a talk

158
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,130
at the DEFCON conference.

159
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,210
What was that like?

160
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,530
- Yeah, that was a dream come true.

161
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,200
Like I said, I grew up on
YouTube watching DEFCON talks

162
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,180
all the time, and getting
to be a part of it myself

163
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,340
was absolutely super rewarding.

164
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,173
- [Rachel] And during your talk,

165
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:55,980
you mentioned memory corruption tasks.

166
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,020
Can you briefly explain what those are?

167
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,730
- Yeah, so memory corruption
attacks are basically

168
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,854
just really confusing the computer

169
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:02,760
into doing something that it shouldn't.

170
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,900
- [Rachel] All right, is there an area

171
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,610
of computer science
research you'd really like

172
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,110
to work on but you haven't yet?

173
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,820
- Yeah, so one thing I've
never actually touched really

174
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,230
is programming language research

175
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,030
or writing new programming languages.

176
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,080
So it might be kind of cool to work

177
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
on how do you build a new
programming language for security.

178
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
- [Rachel] Are there some recent research

179
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,630
you're excited about?

180
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,430
- Yeah, so my group actually
just started pivoting more

181
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,920
into formal verification,
which I think is pretty cool.

182
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,200
- [Rachel] Can you tease
any future research?

183
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,420
- I would love to, but it's top secret.

184
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,340
- [Rachel] So if you're
stuck on a coding issue,

185
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,190
what are your ways to brainstorm
or figure out the problem?

186
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,080
- Yeah, so a big one for
me is hitting the gym,

187
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,040
lifting some weights.

188
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,890
Also going for a walk or
just a nice game of chess.

189
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,730
- [Rachel] Are you more productive

190
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,110
in the morning or at night?

191
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,970
- Gotta be honest, I'm a total night owl.

192
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,980
- [Rachel] What's one task
you wish was automated

193
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,210
but isn't that the moment?

194
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,860
- Ugh. Laundry.

195
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,600
- [Rachel] What do you think
about this crazy building?

196
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,220
- Oh, I absolutely love working here.

197
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,570
The fact that this place is so great

198
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,850
is precisely because it is so crazy.

199
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,910
All the crazy turns and twists
make you constantly lost,

200
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,230
and this means that
you're constantly bumping

201
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,030
into people that you
might not have otherwise.

202
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,590
And so this means that
a lot of conversations

203
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,970
and collaborations happen

204
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,560
that you probably wouldn't
get in a normal building.

205
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,610
- [Rachel] What's more annoying,

206
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,560
software bugs or hardware defects?

207
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,090
- Definitely hardware defects.

208
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,500
So the problem with the hardware defect

209
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,570
is that you can't run around
putting a new transistor

210
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,070
on every chip you've already shipped.

211
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,990
So that makes them way worse.

212
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,760
- [Rachel] And what's more annoying,

213
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,310
a room full of bugs or
software filled with them?

214
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,510
- Definitely a room full of bugs.

215
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,160
'Cause most software
already is full of bugs.

216
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,920
- [Rachel] Now let's do some
favorites, starting with chips.

217
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,090
- Apple M1.

218
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,560
- [Rachel] Favorite
computer science resource?

219
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,430
- YouTube.

220
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,320
- [Rachel] Favorite
computer architecture book.

221
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,460
- Hennessy and Patterson.

222
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,293
- [Rachel] Favorite class
you've taken so far?

223
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,300
- Nickolai Zeldovich's
security class here at MIT.

224
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,530
- [Rachel] Favorite place on campus?

225
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,363
- The gym.

226
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,110
- [Rachel] Favorite MIT traditions.

227
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,090
- MIT Henge, where the light from one end

228
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,590
of the infinite corridor lines up

229
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,600
and perfectly shines
through the entire hallway.

230
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,340
- [Rachel] Favorite music
that gets you in the zone

231
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,420
to do research?

232
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,490
- 90's Rock.
- [Rachel] Favorite concert?

233
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,080
- Actually, I just saw
Blink this past weekend

234
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,010
and they were really good.

235
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,200
- [Rachel] Best sci-fi movie.
- Interstellar.

236
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,820
- [Rachel] Best brand food
for a long day's work.

237
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,653
- Steak.

238
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:58,680
- [Rachel] Favorite restaurant.

239
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,510
- El Jefe's tacos are really good.

240
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,040
- [Rachel] Dream job after graduation?

241
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
- Literally anything that
just lets me hack stuff.

242
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,730
- [Rachel] Where do you
see computer architecture

243
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,860
and security headed in the next decade?

244
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,680
- I'm mostly excited to see
where we go with risk CPUs.

245
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,300
- [Rachel] Now, what's one piece of advice

246
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,790
from an MIT professor that's
really stuck with you?

247
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,560
- Yeah, I'd say the most
important piece of advice

248
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,030
that I've been given is from Menja,

249
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,400
which is to always apply
the scientific method

250
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,010
even in places where it
doesn't immediately make sense.

251
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,870
- [Rachel] And Joseph,
what advice do you have

252
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,400
to young students who are interested

253
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
in computer science and STEM?

254
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,090
- Yeah, honestly, just start hacking.

255
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,890
Go on YouTube, look up
some programming tutorials,

256
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,120
and just start creating something.

257
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,860
Doesn't have to be good. Just start.

258
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,060
- [Rachel] Thanks so much, Joseph.

259
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,070
- Thank you so much. Now
I gotta get back to work.

260
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,903
See ya.
