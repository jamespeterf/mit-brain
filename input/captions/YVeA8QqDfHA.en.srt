1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,860
Some data suggest that lifestyle and

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,160
behavior account for the majority of

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,719
[music] cardiovascular disease risk.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,719
However, newer data since the

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
incorporation of high throughput genomic

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,720
sequencing has suggested that genomics

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,000
play a very large role in the

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
development of cardiovascular disease

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
and diabetes. What we don't know is why

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,119
South Asians have such high

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,519
cardiovascular disease risk.

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,559
Some people say that it's entirely due

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
to our lifestyle and our behaviors.

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,480
Other people say it's due to [music] our

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,040
genetics, something that we inherited

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,120
from generation to generation. South

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
Asians represent [music] 23% of the

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
globe and only 1.3% of genetic study

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
participants.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
Furthermore, we know that [music] very

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,280
few South Asians participate in clinical

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,440
trials, but we don't know the exact

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,440
number because South Asians are often

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,719
grouped into a larger category [music]

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
termed Asian other. What we as doctors

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,960
worry about is that there are [music]

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,320
genetic reasons why South Asians have

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
such high rates of cardiovascular

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840
disease and diabetes.

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,520
Talk to [music] your friends and family

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,080
about the high rates of cardiovascular

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,159
disease and diabetes in South Asians and

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,159
encourage them to join our health.
