1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,960
When we saw that there was a

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,120
bladesmithing class, we all jumped on

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
the idea of learning how to make a

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,519
blade.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,440
>> It was just a awesome new class that

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,080
they decided to do because Bob Kramer

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
was going to be here.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
>> When I heard that he was coming to MIT,

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
I knew this was a very unique

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,800
opportunity I wouldn't really get again.

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,519
>> Bob Kramer is a master bladesmith whose

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,320
specialty is actually uh cooking knives,

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,640
but beyond that, as an artist, the

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
pieces he makes are all singular. My

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,000
background is cooking and so essentially

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm cooking steel. I'm making up new

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,440
recipes with steel.

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,320
>> If you look at the MIT logo, there's a

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,559
blacksmith, the men's a manus minds and

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,160
hands. And so the teaching uh and the

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,760
practice of working with metals has been

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,719
an important part of our department for

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,640
a long time.
