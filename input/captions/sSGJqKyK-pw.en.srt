1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,120
uh I am Miki Kato program director ofp

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,280
and I will moderate this first you know

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,800
afternoon session talk so first I would

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,680
like to introduce Dr Ben Armstrong he is

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
the executive director and research

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,560
scientist at industrial performance

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,560
center and also he is a co-lead of the

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,960
works of the future initiatives he talk

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,359
about productivity Improvement in

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,840
manufacturing and adaptability of the

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,680
new technology and Workforce practice so

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,680
Dr Ben

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Armstrong hello everyone I'd like to

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,960
start by sharing the story of four

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,280
factories the first pictured here is in

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,600
Denver Colorado not far from a major

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,800
American city where wages are high but

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,119
at this Factory they make products very

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,840
inexpensively they make a variety of

20
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,240
composite products from bicycle wheels

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,200
to backpack frames and they make these

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,720
products so reliably and so

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,600
inexpensively that they actually

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,080
outcompete Taiwan and China the dominant

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,720
producers of these Goods they end up

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,560
exporting their goods to to China this

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,439
is only a small shop about 50 people and

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,560
nonetheless they're growing dramatically

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,079
both in productivity and in size here's

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,200
a a second Factory this Factory is in

31
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,680
Los Angeles another large high-wage uh

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,799
place and what this Factory is doing is

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,240
they're producing one of the first lines

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,000
of all electric boats these boats have

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,479
been called Teslas on the water and it's

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
no surprise really that they call them

37
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,560
Teslas in part because uh the founding

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
team has modeled their production

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,320
strategy on Tesla's Roadster which

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,399
emphasized not necessarily quality but

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,000
speed to Market so they developed their

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,920
first prototype electric boat in just a

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,960
matter of weeks and then their first

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,719
several product lines were on the market

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,640
and fully sold out in only a couple of

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,160
years um without much Capital actually

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,400
uh it wasn't a very Capital intensive

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,319
process either so another very uh

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,879
fast-moving and high growth uh process

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,560
this time with a a a slightly larger

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,200
team but to go from from zero to a

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,280
standing product that is sold out now

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,760
long into the future they've done it

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,160
very quickly and effectively um the next

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,160
Factory is closer to MIT it's in a rural

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,480
community in New Hampshire where it's

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,280
hard to find skilled labor skilled

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,400
technicians but nonetheless this Factory

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,720
produces machine cutting tools that they

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,640
export all over the world and the

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,200
factory itself is fully owned by its

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,720
employees so this employee is named Sam

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,680
Seer he makes a high wage and he also

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,519
earns a cut of the profit each quarter

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,800
that comes out from the company so when

66
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,800
the company considered to adopt new

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,480
robots to improve productivity or to um

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,959
experiment with new technologies on the

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,599
factory floor Sam was very supportive

70
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,159
and what he did in order to learn about

71
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,159
those processes is he went to the

72
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,319
internal University at the company in

73
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,040
this rural area where they trained him

74
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:22,360
how to operate these new tools and then

75
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,239
finally here is a a company in Ohio

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,640
which is in the traditional rust belt

77
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,120
for former manufacturing Powerhouse of

78
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,080
of the United States it's only a 20%

79
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,480
Factory that makes a a high mix of low

80
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,159
volume Goods for the Aerospace and

81
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,159
defense industry as well as the

82
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,920
automotive industry and this Factory

83
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,560
despite low growth all around it in the

84
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,159
region has tripled its productivity in

85
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,239
the last seven years and also tripled

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,040
its output they've become one of the

87
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
most competitive factories they have

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,360
almost um doubled the productivity of

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,319
their industry competitors now okay so

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
the question that I have really the

91
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,360
question that drives my research and the

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,680
research of our group at MIT is a what

93
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,920
makes these factories so exceptional so

94
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,840
competitive and high performing and B

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,919
how can more factories operate like this

96
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,400
in the United States how can they

97
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,040
compete in high wage environments with

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,440
other factories around the world that

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,720
face all sorts of other different

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,360
challenges so today I want to offer

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,479
first a set of hypotheses about what

102
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,080
makes these factories so special

103
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
and then I want to talk about some of

104
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,160
the early Clues and Investments

105
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,280
happening in the United States that are

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,560
trying to replicate the success of

107
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,759
factories like these okay so I want to

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,400
focus on three factors that make these

109
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
factories different from other factories

110
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
in the United States and I'll say in a

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,680
moment I think a lot of factories in

112
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,960
Japan as well the first is that each of

113
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,639
these factories has a different risk

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,440
profile than the typical high-wage

115
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,080
manufacturing environment so over time

116
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,080
as I'll I'll explain uh manufacturers in

117
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,320
the United States have become more and

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,360
more risk averse less willing to invest

119
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,080
in New Capital Equipment and less

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,400
willing to invest in process Improvement

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,160
that isn't a slam dunk that isn't very

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,800
easy to map out and in very low risk so

123
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,440
what each of these factories has done is

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,720
they've actually had big projects that

125
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,520
have failed before they found process

126
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,919
improvements that could succeed and

127
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,880
they've also raised risk Capital either

128
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,199
from private Equity Funds or in one case

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,280
Venture capitalists

130
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,199
that allowed them to grow at a very

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,600
rapid

132
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,680
Pace the second piece that has

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
differentiated these factories is their

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,600
use of Technology it's not just that

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,919
they have robotic automation or Advanced

136
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,680
five AIS machines it's that they've used

137
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,400
software to customize a lot of their

138
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,960
equipment and then finally they have

139
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,560
internal skills to use that technology

140
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
effectively in one case the case of the

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,319
the bicycle wheel manufacturer that I

142
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,880
mentioned first the the idea behind the

143
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,400
factory is that anyone can buy or build

144
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,720
an automated solution but not anyone can

145
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,479
use it at its full productive capacity

146
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,759
and that's where the skill comes in now

147
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,280
I want to link this to you know many

148
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,639
environments where I'm sure you work in

149
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Japan so yesterday I was with colleagues

150
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,400
from the University of Tokyo and we went

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,000
to a factory about an hour and a half

152
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,840
west of here that produces had

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,280
traditionally produced Automotive

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,680
components uh piping as a supplier for

155
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,560
one of the large Japanese oems and

156
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,759
recently a shifted to produce components

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,080
for Semiconductor equipment and um and

158
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,039
medical devices and one of the really

159
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,720
interesting pieces of this company was

160
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,360
that similar to the companies that I

161
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,000
study in the United States this company

162
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,440
had a very active skill development uh

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,120
process internally their employees had

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,400
required training hours to have each

165
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,840
year the employees were also co-owners

166
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,840
of the company they had 50% of the

167
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,520
profit share um each quarter and finally

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,319
the employees were also skilled at

169
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,840
machine building so this company made an

170
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,000
active decision to build all of their

171
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,280
own internal equipment program at

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,680
themselves that was going to be a fourth

173
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,479
of the cost of relying on externally

174
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,680
built equipment and that was these

175
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,199
internal skills that I think made made

176
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,280
this company one of the most competitive

177
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,000
and they they had a wall full of awards

178
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,080
that differentiated them from from their

179
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,479
competitors in Japan so I think that

180
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,879
there are common threads here between

181
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,720
American manufacturers on the frontier

182
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,039
of productivity and Japanese

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,759
manufacturers as as well and what I've

184
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,840
learned from these American factories is

185
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,919
that what it looks like when you combine

186
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,919
these three elements is that you really

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,879
merge the teams that are doing product

188
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,599
development and re product development

189
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,759
and research with the teams that are

190
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,479
managing production and this is an idea

191
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,000
that really comes first from uh Tesla

192
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,680
and SpaceX as well as from Amazon which

193
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,639
is not in manufacturing but I would say

194
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,240
manufacturing adjacent and the Amazon

195
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,759
fulfillment center network was

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,639
established by it turns out an MIT

197
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,759
alumnus who uh has a background in

198
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,240
chemical engineering so the flow through

199
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
that fulfillment network is is operating

200
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,319
at a same the same idea that you're

201
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,720
going to be able to run experiments on

202
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,599
the factory floor similar to you would

203
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,759
run in an R&D lab and you're going to

204
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,639
take risks that then you can easily and

205
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,919
quickly translate into um real

206
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,240
production steps that are actively

207
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,919
producing something new now at Tesla as

208
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,000
many of you I'm sure are familiar with

209
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,840
this often can go can go wrong and

210
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,840
they've made a lot of choices that have

211
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,919
led to to Quality defects by collap ing

212
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,839
the R&D team into the production team

213
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,360
but nonetheless it represents a very

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
different model of how to approach uh

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,800
manufacturing excellence and it's

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,399
allowed them to scale very quickly and

217
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,959
to learn very quickly so now when I I

218
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,560
study um you can think of them as the

219
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,720
cousins of Tesla or the the

220
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,640
grandchildren of Tesla the people who

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,680
worked at Tesla or SpaceX and have now

222
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,279
spun out a company there's one actually

223
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,640
here exhibiting these companies exhibit

224
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,839
a similar sense of experimentation so

225
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,720
Arc boats which I mentioned has a very

226
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,959
uh Common Sense where their R&D team is

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,760
actually located on the factory floor

228
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,120
and they can see the projects they're

229
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,920
working on right next to their stations

230
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,320
all right why do I think this is all

231
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,800
important to understand and to exemplify

232
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,160
it's important in part because this is

233
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
so different from what the modal

234
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,399
manufacturer in the US and I would

235
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,399
venture to say the modal manufacturer in

236
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,000
in Japan looks like and here's here's

237
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,600
why I say that so here's you know if I

238
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,399
were to kind of capture the arc

239
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,200
Manufacturing in the United States in

240
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,880
one chart this is this would be it and

241
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,640
I'll I'll show you uh roughly what the

242
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
chart in Japan would look like uh in a

243
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,800
moment but if you think about it it's

244
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,560
I'm going to break it down into two eras

245
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,959
you know roughly before 1984 and after

246
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,000
and I'll take a moment to walk you

247
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,120
through this so here I'm plotting the

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,880
red Capital expenditures so investment

249
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,399
in technology over time the yellow you

250
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,440
know production employment workers on

251
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,959
the factory floor productivity and green

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,360
value added so output minus input in

253
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,760
blue and then finally production wages

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,560
adjusted for inflation in the pink now

255
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,720
what we see in the era of mass

256
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
production in the United States really

257
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,680
production conglomerates where you have

258
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,640
a lot of companies that are producing

259
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,920
not only a high volume of goods but also

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,720
a high variety of goods so you have many

261
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,440
companies that are producing uh cars and

262
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,880
trucks but also producing defense

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,920
equipment and producing consumer

264
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
products etc etc they have a wide

265
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,040
variety of skills under roof this might

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
sound familiar because I think there

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
were were uh commonalities both in

268
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,600
ownership structure but also in

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,360
diversification with uh modern ketsu and

270
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,320
what you see also is after you know 1947

271
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,920
there's an kind of a positive and a

272
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,800
growth equilibrium among these

273
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,839
categories workers are earning higher

274
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,320
wages productivity is going up quite

275
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,279
sharply along with the investment in new

276
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,720
technology and something in the early

277
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,560
1980s really changes actually few things

278
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,680
change in the early 1980s um Capital

279
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,200
expenditures after that point are mostly

280
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,320
flat adjusted for inflation there's no

281
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,880
real growth in technology investment um

282
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,480
employment goes down quite sharply

283
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,760
productivity goes up that's really just

284
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
associated with this decline in

285
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
employment because value added stays the

286
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,760
same it actually goes down a little bit

287
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,680
overall so what's What's Happening Here

288
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,000
I think a few things are happening one

289
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,440
there's a series of changes both

290
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,120
regulatory changes but also changes in

291
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,079
management strategy in the United States

292
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,720
that lead companies to become far more

293
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,519
risk averse and less willing to invest

294
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,880
in growth in part because there's new

295
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,600
competition early on in the 1980s there

296
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,600
was competition from uh Japanese

297
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,639
manufacturers with at that time lower

298
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,639
wages but really operational excellence

299
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,560
that was leading American manufacturers

300
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,959
to figure out how to respond and what

301
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,839
really happened at this point was that

302
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,880
financial markets changed how they

303
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,440
valued manufacturing companies

304
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,639
and American manufacturers changed the

305
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,680
Paradigm of how they thought about

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,160
production many of you know this trend

307
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,560
I'm sure better than I and it was a

308
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,920
really a shift from the idea of flexible

309
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,000
mass production to what was actually

310
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,760
termed coined MIT lean production which

311
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,240
was modeled on the Toyota production

312
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,920
system so what lean did in the United

313
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,000
States was it helped at least in the

314
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,360
short term companies become more

315
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
productive essentially to do the same

316
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,120
with fewer employees that was what

317
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,680
productivity looked like in the US

318
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,160
environment now why I've become

319
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,079
interested in this is this last part

320
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,760
here since 2010 American manufacturers

321
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,279
have actually become less productive

322
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,399
overall that a lot of these Investments

323
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,519
over time and in continuous process

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,560
Improvement um that had delivered

325
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,839
productivity are no longer doing it and

326
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,480
American manufacturing has more demand

327
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,800
than it's had in the last four decades

328
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
but nonetheless we can't improve our

329
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,000
productivity so this is really the

330
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,360
puzzle driving American manufacturing

331
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,120
right now American manufacturers have

332
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,040
become less productive over the last 14

333
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,040
years but our our political environment

334
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,720
and the global economic environment has

335
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,040
more demand than ever for local

336
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,320
manufacturing near uh production centers

337
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,320
there's a need to produce more like the

338
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,639
four companies I mentioned at the

339
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,519
beginning now you might be wondering

340
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,320
what if I were to plot these same

341
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,040
figures for Japanese manufacturing over

342
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,360
time what would they look like so lucky

343
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,199
enough my colleagues at University of

344
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,600
Tokyo shared those plots yesterday I'm

345
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,120
happy to forward them to you they're all

346
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,120
in Japanese so I can just understand the

347
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,880
the lines in the line chart but I'll

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,079
I'll plot them roughly here so these

349
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,320
figures before 1990 look very similar

350
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,000
where there's if you take about 1960 to

351
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,839
1990 there's uh employment growth

352
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,399
productivity growth and output growth

353
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,199
that's that's quite dramatic among

354
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,519
Japanese manufacturers and what happens

355
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,240
after 1990 this is with the onset of

356
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,240
competition from China that was how they

357
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
explained it was that the US faced

358
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,040
competition from Japan in the 80s Japan

359
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,519
faced competition from China in the 90s

360
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,519
and then the US faced competition from

361
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,399
China beginning the 2000s so it's a nice

362
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,160
you know ping pong effect um instead of

363
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,320
the flattening of these curves or the

364
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,120
decline of productivity what Japanese

365
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,480
manufacturing has experienced is a kind

366
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,800
of a bode curve where it looks more like

367
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,279
a root curve so where us has been 0%

368
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,160
growth in Japan it's been between 10 and

369
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,160
20% so there's a similar challenge of

370
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,800
slowed growth but it's just been it's

371
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,759
been less severe in Japan is this these

372
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,680
are the data from from my colleagues so

373
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,920
I would say there are some parallel uh

374
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,680
challenges here now one of the questions

375
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,880
that I think is is reasonable to ask is

376
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,120
how have why haven't American

377
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,839
manufacturers been able to extract the

378
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,800
same benefits from lean and the Toyota

379
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,240
production system as their Japanese

380
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
counterparts now you might be familiar

381
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,800
with this this is how you uh Toyota's

382
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,639
production system is communicated to

383
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,079
American firms this is often considered

384
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,120
kind of the House of the Toyota

385
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,759
production system with several main

386
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
components and after talking to a lot of

387
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,880
firms that would consider themselves

388
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,440
lean in the United States what I find

389
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,480
really interesting is that every

390
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,839
American firm I talk to has a different

391
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,560
definition of what lean is some Focus

392
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,079
just on reducing waste it's essentially

393
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,240
an optimization function of how do we

394
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,839
get zero waste some focus on inventory

395
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
and just on the just in time being a

396
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,600
pull versus a push manufacturer and then

397
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,120
others focus more exclusively on Joka on

398
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
continuous Improvement through respect

399
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800
for people and on kind of the skill

400
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,160
development side so lean means a lot of

401
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,639
different things to different

402
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,279
organizations in the United States now I

403
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,120
don't really think that's the problem

404
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,120
here I think the problem is more readily

405
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,240
that in the United States there's none

406
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,720
of the kind of the foundation for the

407
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,160
house that is present in Japan so you

408
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
might be familiar with these works and

409
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,040
these were really important works for

410
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,839
American manufacturers and American

411
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Scholars to understand what was

412
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,000
happening in Japanese manufacturing and

413
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,360
why uh Japanese manufacturing was

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,720
growing so quickly um in the 1960s and

415
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,120
70s but really this this whole house was

416
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,120
underpinned by industrial policy and

417
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,279
also a corporate governance system that

418
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,480
allowed Japanese manufacturers to manage

419
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,560
risk and and be able to continue

420
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,120
diversifying in ways that us

421
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,839
manufacturers couldn't so if we contrast

422
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,240
that with the trend in the United States

423
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,920
which said you know in

424
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,240
1980 60% of manufacturing conglomerates

425
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,800
had you know Diversified portfolios were

426
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,240
producing a diverse uh portfolio of

427
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,440
goods and by 1990 0% were Diversified

428
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,240
the shift in financial markets was

429
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,040
really to support pure playay

430
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,440
manufacturers that could do one thing

431
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,880
very well and that the market could

432
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,079
price very easily because a lot of these

433
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,600
uh a lot of these organizations were

434
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,079
publicly traded so this has LED over the

435
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,120
last 40 years for public markets in the

436
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,559
United States to be less and less

437
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,439
willing to invest in asset heavy

438
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,439
businesses and that's helped drive a

439
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,319
trend toward offshoring even if

440
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,319
offshoring wasn't the right long-term

441
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,880
decision for a lot of these

442
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,919
manufacturers because they were

443
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,839
sacrificing some of their core

444
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,199
capabilities okay so this is the the

445
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,600
risk component when we talk about how

446
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,160
the the four Factories at the beginning

447
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,520
were more risk tolerant it's in contrast

448
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,200
to this trend which has made a lot of of

449
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,440
American manufacturers more risk

450
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,679
averse the second piece is is technology

451
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,280
and you might imagine and even be you

452
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,559
know directly familiar with a risk

453
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,880
averse mentality leads uh a lot of

454
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,640
Manufacturers to avoid investments in

455
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,760
new technology unless they're absolutely

456
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,120
necessary so one of the the Striking

457
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,919
things to me is someone who who who

458
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
studies Automation and its effect on

459
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,080
work in manufacturing is that despite

460
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,880
all the uh robotics research happening

461
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,840
at MIT actual robot adoption has been

462
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,520
quite flat in most countries even

463
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,640
countries that have a a strong

464
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,000
background in robotics so for the last

465
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,799
10 years uh this pink line is the United

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,520
States I should do probably red white

467
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,880
and blue um but it nonetheless it's pink

468
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,880
so last 10 years our robot installations

469
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,720
have been flat there's no real growth

470
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,080
and scale up of robotic use in

471
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,039
manufacturing these are industrial

472
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,880
robots um in Japan it's a little better

473
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,440
um like like many of the figures in

474
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,880
manufacturing but there's actually been

475
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,760
a decline even you know this was numbers

476
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,600
ending in in 2020 but they're pretty

477
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,520
stable after this there's been a slight

478
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,000
uptick overall in Japan and the one

479
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,720
anomally here is China with a large

480
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,679
scale up mostly due to government

481
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,080
subsidies in manufacturing now you may

482
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,280
wonder you know can we really trust the

483
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,600
data from China here this data is coming

484
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,440
from um actually robot manufacturer so I

485
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
think we can trust it but we can trust

486
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,159
it only to a point so I would encourage

487
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,440
you if you're interested to read the

488
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,799
work of a a sociologist at at Harvard

489
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,480
named yaah WL who has gone to factories

490
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,000
in China to study how they're using

491
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,000
robots and what she finds is a lot of

492
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,400
the robots that were subsidized by the

493
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,120
government end up in the corner of the

494
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,840
factory collecting dust partly because

495
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,120
the government provided these incentives

496
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,520
without an actual demand for the robots

497
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,720
and partly because the manufacturers in

498
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,280
electronics assembly for example were

499
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,760
expecting these robots to be able to

500
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,200
hand delicate electronic components but

501
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,840
the robots don't have that level of

502
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,360
dexterity yet so this is a kind of a

503
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,559
mismatch between

504
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,120
um Form and Function at the

505
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,760
moment okay one of the the issues here

506
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,360
you know you okay so now we have flat

507
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
robot adoption maybe that's because of

508
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,640
risk what really is going on so we've

509
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,880
had data now from you know this is from

510
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,480
a large robot manufacturer and we also

511
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,520
have some some data from a US Census of

512
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,360
businesses and how they use robots and

513
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,039
what we've noticed is that one of the

514
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,960
key problems here is not only that

515
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,400
there's only a small percentage of

516
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,440
American factories that adopt robots in

517
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,480
the first place robotic automation this

518
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,919
is not just robots it's also other types

519
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,960
of specialized equipment I'll show it in

520
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,000
a second but it's that only about half a

521
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,520
little a little more than half of the

522
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,600
companies that adopt robots uh buy a

523
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,280
second robot we refer to this as the

524
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,120
second robot problem that we know for

525
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,559
these firms when they scale up their use

526
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,559
of Robotics they hire more people they

527
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,679
become more productive they become more

528
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,159
profitable and yet they're still in the

529
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,640
very small minority of overall

530
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
manufactur uring firms so this is a

531
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,360
question of you know what's happening

532
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,960
here why is it so difficult for firms to

533
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,080
automate at

534
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,200
scale um I'm going to pause it that one

535
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,240
of the big challenges here is that a lot

536
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,280
of the firms that could make use of

537
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,400
robots but don't end up purchasing them

538
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,159
don't have the internal skills to use

539
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,880
these robots effectively so these are

540
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,880
again data from us manufacturers um

541
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,400
showing their different their purchase

542
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,679
of various you know Advanced or even

543
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,240
pretty basic equipment and then this is

544
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,240
data from job postings at manufacturers

545
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,000
so these are hundreds of thousands of

546
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,919
production job postings fewer than one

547
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,640
in five of those jobs requires any

548
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,480
digital skills at all that could be

549
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
operating Microsoft Excel to writing

550
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,799
machine learning algorithms they're

551
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,480
they're it's very rare in the United

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,279
States to require um manufacturing

553
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,240
workers to have digital skills and

554
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,480
that's really holding back the adoption

555
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,000
of new

556
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,039
technologies okay there are there are

557
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,640
deeper problems in the manufacturing

558
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,640
Workforce um this these data might seem

559
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,840
familiar because they're actually

560
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,159
they're similar in uh European countries

561
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,120
and in Japan is that the the

562
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,559
manufacturing Workforce has aged

563
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,720
dramatically and it's not only aged it's

564
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,640
also it's stopped hiring so there's a

565
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,000
big gap between old manufacturing

566
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,320
workers and young and this is just a

567
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,279
visualization of that so the red is the

568
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,200
distribution you know reasonably healthy

569
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,640
distribution of workers in an industry

570
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,240
it Peaks at you know late 30s early 40s

571
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,600
that's where most of the workers are and

572
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,000
it's relatively normally distributed now

573
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,640
what happened when you when you don't

574
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,279
hire manufacturing workers for the

575
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,440
better part of 20 years that Peak just

576
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,640
moves over and then you have a gap in

577
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
knowledge and experience and

578
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,840
Manufacturing and then it's only been in

579
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,760
the last five to seven years that firms

580
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,520
have had an uptick in hiring one of the

581
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,039
Practical challenges that some of you

582
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,640
might face firsthand and what we hear

583
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,960
from a lot of firms is that a lot of the

584
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,559
knowledge among workers here is not

585
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,760
codified anywhere there's no clear way

586
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,919
way to transfer that to this younger

587
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,200
generation without necessarily the

588
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,159
experience or even the the language and

589
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,600
understanding to absorb the knowledge

590
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,400
from the most skilled technical workers

591
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,159
so one of I think the big challenges for

592
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,799
institutions like MIT and institutions

593
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,799
like let's say the university and and

594
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:51,559
the firm that I explained is to figure

595
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:54,200
out a way to codify and somehow deliver

596
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,600
these skills to the next generation of

597
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,120
workers um this isn't easy and and this

598
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,960
is one of the reasons why this this is

599
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,080
so challenging um over the last you know

600
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,600
uh 15 years or so there's been a an

601
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,159
increase in demand for manufacturing

602
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,039
workers but also an increase in turnover

603
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,400
so the tenure of manufacturing workers

604
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,360
is becoming shorter the time that they

605
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,440
have to gain the skills in order to

606
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,400
operate new technologies understand to

607
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,320
process very intimately is getting

608
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,960
shorter so this is I think an even

609
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,520
bigger challenge for firms when they try

610
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,640
to develop skills one of the the paths

611
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,400
that American firms have taken with this

612
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,200
short 10-year environment is to say

613
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,760
we're not even going to try to look for

614
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,679
highly skilled workers instead we're

615
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,880
going to take any worker available and

616
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,080
we're going to try to train them

617
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,520
internally this is a challenge when your

618
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,880
average worker might only stay at your

619
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,600
firm for one to two

620
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,200
years

621
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,000
okay this is this is I think a challenge

622
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,360
that's underlying a lot of uh the other

623
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,320
problems and it's a lot of firms they

624
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,960
might complain that they can't find

625
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,799
workers because this generation isn't as

626
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,080
inclined toward manufacturing as the

627
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:06,000
previous ones or um in some cases it's

628
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,159
the that the workforce um itself is

629
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,600
focused more on um other Industries but

630
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,000
they don't deal with what really is a

631
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,720
root cause problem and that's wages so

632
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,320
this is quite different in in Japan

633
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,679
where there's still a significant wage

634
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,039
premium for manufacturing jobs but in

635
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,559
the United States this green line is uh

636
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,159
wages for careers in let's say working

637
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,640
at a grocery store working in a

638
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,880
warehouse non-manufacturing jobs and the

639
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,399
gray line is manufacturing jobs so in

640
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,200
1960 and even into the 70s and ' 80s

641
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,799
there was a very significant premium

642
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,159
work for working in manufacturing if you

643
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,200
had a high school education or even an

644
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,080
associates degree less than a four-year

645
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,039
degree you could make between 20 and 40%

646
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,520
more in manufacturing than you could in

647
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:54,279
alternative careers and today you can

648
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,799
make 2% more in in manufacturing in the

649
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:57,760
United States than you can alternativ

650
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,399
it's pretty much the same in places like

651
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,159
Massachusetts

652
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,480
California um it's negative you actually

653
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,679
can make less on average in

654
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,440
manufacturing than in other careers

655
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,200
overall so one reason for a Workforce

656
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,360
shortage or a lack of skills is that

657
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,679
manufacturing jobs aren't really paying

658
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,240
that much now you might imagine this is

659
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,679
a chicken and egg problem if they're not

660
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,720
demanding skills um they're probably not

661
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,279
able to pay justify paying that much

662
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,640
particularly if they're uh losing

663
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,799
productivity over time okay now I think

664
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,360
the question is what what do we do about

665
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,919
this what are paths to encourage

666
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,399
companies to be more growth oriented

667
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,679
more risk tolerant to improve technology

668
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,120
adoption and skill development now I've

669
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,600
noticed partly through study of

670
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,640
companies like the the four that I

671
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,159
introduced that there are there are

672
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,799
really three models and I want to

673
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,360
highlight a few here so one is a return

674
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:51,600
to some version of conglomeration where

675
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,080
we have I would say a pseudo

676
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,279
conglomeration in the United States

677
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:58,600
through private Equity held firms uh but

678
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,159
the challenge of private equity uh

679
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,120
corporate governance is that it's

680
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,600
relatively short-term that the the goal

681
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,080
of the private Equity Firm is to P is to

682
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,520
acquire an asset and then turn it over

683
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,399
at a higher value not to invest in the

684
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,640
long-term sustainability and health of

685
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:15,159
that asset one of the differences of of

686
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,520
a company called rebuild manufacturing

687
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:20,080
which has a connection to mit's uh

688
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,279
leaders for manufacturing program is

689
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,000
that it's set up as a holding company

690
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,520
similar to danur which some of you might

691
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,320
be familiar with and they have

692
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,039
explicitly said and you know I think to

693
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,279
some people's Chagrin that they want to

694
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,120
be like an American ketu that they

695
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,159
really are explicitly modeled on a

696
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,799
Japanese form of conglomeration and they

697
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,000
have tried to internalize some of the

698
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,880
principles of of lean but with a

699
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,320
different orientation toward technology

700
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,399
and skill so one of the portfolio

701
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,200
companies of rebuild is the Colorado

702
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:51,159
firm making bicycle wheels that I

703
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,240
mentioned uh at the top they have more

704
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,440
than a dozen other factories throughout

705
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,840
the country now and are growing quite

706
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,799
rapidly so the second model of dealing

707
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,480
with risk is a venture capital model a

708
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,600
startup model that um has served America

709
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,919
American companies well in software and

710
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,360
there are now multiple growing Venture

711
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,399
Capital firms that are financing

712
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,279
startups like the boat startup I

713
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,360
mentioned which is a in the eclipse

714
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:20,080
portfolio um over

715
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:23,240
time the part of the uh motivation for

716
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,799
Eclipse comes out of experiences at

717
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,320
Tesla rivan and SpaceX where a lot of

718
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,360
their Partners come from and to support

719
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,919
uh Founders who have come out of those

720
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,440
organizations and learned key principles

721
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,039
about experimental manufacturing um

722
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,480
while at these companies and then

723
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,960
finally one of the the real Trends in

724
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,679
the last 20 years has been there's been

725
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,840
an upsurge in foreign investment in the

726
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,840
United States so similar to how um lean

727
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,399
and the Toyota production system helped

728
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,799
spread through Partnerships like numi

729
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,760
between GM and Toyota in California as

730
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,080
well as just direct investments from

731
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,200
Honda Toyota and others in the United

732
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,440
States uh there was a lot of knowledge

733
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,039
and a lot of I think uh skill that has

734
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,159
spilled over due to foreign direct

735
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,240
investment so just to visualize this for

736
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:12,760
a second here's a plot just of a billion

737
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,960
dooll factories so very large Factory

738
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,960
projects over the last um you know 20 or

739
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,440
so years and what we've seen since covid

740
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,159
and is is and this trend toward the

741
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,440
localization of of manufacturing is a

742
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,320
tripling of billion dollar Factory

743
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,320
projects that are foreign owned so to

744
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,600
40% of all new large Factory projects in

745
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,919
the United States are from foreign owned

746
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,919
companies and you can imagine you

747
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,120
overall manufacturing uh Capital stock

748
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,799
in red pretty flat but the foreign

749
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,039
direct investment position has more than

750
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,000
doubled during that same time so there's

751
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,880
really a higher presence of foreign

752
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,559
companies why is that important well the

753
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,200
foreign companies that can afford to

754
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,039
make large investments in the United

755
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,480
States have a significantly higher

756
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,360
productivity than their American

757
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,159
counterparts they pay higher wages and

758
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,039
they invest more in technology so the

759
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,480
the hope at least is that these

760
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,880
companies will induce um more

761
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,880
risk-taking and a more productive

762
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,919
orientation of their American peers

763
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,679
through

764
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,039
competition okay now the other thing

765
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,399
this is a really core to the research um

766
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:21,679
within my my group is how do we

767
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:23,799
encourage more investment in technology

768
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,679
and induce more skill development within

769
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,640
manufacturing I think part of the

770
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,600
challenge here is that the typical model

771
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,240
for a adopting Technologies like robots

772
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,159
um in the United States has been to try

773
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,279
to use these tools to drive more

774
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,399
productivity but to drive more

775
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,600
productivity at the expense of the

776
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:43,559
workers who have been involved in a a

777
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,320
routine process over time so there's

778
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,799
more productivity but the tradeoff is

779
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,880
that jobs are more commodified and lower

780
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,320
quality and one of the results of this

781
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,159
process when it's taken to its logical

782
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,640
end is that automation projects end up

783
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,880
being brittle and at times failing so

784
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,000
you know we have a project um that if

785
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,200
you're interested I'd be happy to talk

786
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,120
about um looking at failed Automation

787
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,320
and trying to understand the root causes

788
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,039
of failed large automation projects like

789
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,000
Tesla's model 3 um there's a a large

790
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:14,000
tool Factory um run by Stanley Black

791
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,399
and& Decker that ended up failing in

792
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,360
Texas and then kind of the original um

793
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,279
which was actually inspired by GM

794
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,600
president's uh Roger Smith's visit to um

795
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,399
to Japan in the 1980s was the factory of

796
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,039
the future he called it uh where the

797
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,240
term lights out manufacturing came from

798
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,240
from and it was a factory that

799
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,919
ultimately um ran into a lot of

800
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,840
technical Pro problems and ultimately

801
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,320
shut down um so I think there there's an

802
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,640
alternative here though an alternative

803
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,240
that that creates automation that's more

804
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,679
flexible that relies more on workers in

805
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,320
higher quality higher skilled jobs now

806
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,679
what does that look like you know one of

807
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,960
the things we wanted to do is we wanted

808
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,559
to ask workers what they thought about

809
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,120
an automated environment that could help

810
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,720
them build more quality jobs we didn't

811
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,279
just want to ask CEOs so we did a um a

812
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,919
survey of 9,000 workers in nine

813
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,039
different countries about half of the

814
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,080
workers were in the US and then half of

815
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,120
the workers were in Europe and Asia we

816
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,960
surveyed 500 workers in Japan and I'm

817
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,120
happy to share you know uh the the

818
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,519
differences but what we what we realized

819
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,480
through that survey and I'll I'll share

820
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,840
some details in a moment is that uh

821
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,600
redesigning jobs can be really critical

822
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,320
to getting workers on board with an

823
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,200
automation project and one way to to

824
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,120
help workers get engaged is through

825
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,320
targeted incentives so I mentioned at

826
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,440
the beginning with those four firms the

827
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,039
employee ownership or employee um profit

828
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,760
sharing was really critical to

829
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,240
supporting employees who wanted to work

830
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,120
with new technology and wanted to

831
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,600
develop the skills to use it effectively

832
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,000
so here are some of the results of that

833
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,559
survey first one thing we were really

834
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,799
surprised by is that when we asked

835
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,919
workers how they related to automation

836
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,880
what impact they thought Automation and

837
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,360
Robotics would have on their jobs they

838
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,799
were mostly positive so when we asked

839
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,720
how does automation affect your your

840
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,200
safety and comfort at work you know

841
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,320
workers were 30 more 30% more positive

842
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,159
than than negative similarly when we

843
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,159
asked them how does automation help you

844
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,799
develop new skills grow in your career

845
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,799
workers were far more positive than

846
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,840
negative they were even you know

847
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,880
although somewhat divided slightly

848
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,720
positive about um the effect of

849
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,880
automation on their job security that

850
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,559
they thought automation might make them

851
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,399
more secure versus

852
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,360
less now what I want to share is that

853
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,840
this this wasn't present for all workers

854
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,440
or all countries so in Japan workers

855
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,240
were actually quite optimistic

856
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,320
about the impact of automation but in

857
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,519
the US they were the most pessimistic

858
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,840
workers that we encountered actually the

859
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,120
only workers with pessimism overall kind

860
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,399
of a net negative score on job security

861
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,960
or pay were in the US so American

862
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,960
workers are actually have a much more

863
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,639
negative orientation toward technology

864
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,279
overall than workers in let's say

865
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:54,880
Germany France Spain or or J um or Japan

866
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,360
now we want to understand why might a

867
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,200
worker be pessimistic toward new

868
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,960
technology might why might they resist

869
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,799
Automation and one hypothesis we had was

870
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,120
that workers in more routine jobs jobs

871
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,320
that might be most vulnerable to new

872
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,519
technology they might be more uh

873
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,320
resistant so we tested it we asked

874
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,639
workers what type of tasks do you do um

875
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,440
as a part of your daily routine and and

876
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,000
we tried to uh see if there was a

877
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,880
relationship between these questions

878
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,480
about

879
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,159
automation so here's what we found to

880
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,600
our surprise we found that the level of

881
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,919
routineness in a worker's job didn't

882
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,799
actually matter that much for the

883
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,960
perception of automation it was their

884
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,200
level of problem solving their level of

885
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,320
kind of the creative input that they

886
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,679
provided into the manufacturing process

887
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,799
that really made a difference so here

888
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,320
are workers in manufacturing Environ you

889
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,440
physical environments with high routine

890
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,279
tasks but low problem solving and these

891
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,279
workers are very pessimistic they're

892
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,399
negative toward the impact of automation

893
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:52,240
on their wages negative about the impact

894
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,600
of automation on their job security but

895
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,600
when you take the workers with the same

896
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,960
routineness but they do more problem

897
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,039
solving they say that problem solving is

898
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,840
a core part of their work they're among

899
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,039
the most optimistic and our our kind of

900
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,519
you know hypothesis we don't have a

901
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,799
clear explanation for why this is the

902
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,760
case but our hypothesis is that if

903
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,560
workers have enough problem solving

904
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,960
enough cognitive work that they're doing

905
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,359
they're less threatened because their

906
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,639
core tasks of their jobs aren't readily

907
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:19,399
automatable whereas they have work that

908
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,320
might be drudgery that they want a

909
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,639
technology to take care of that those

910
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,960
high level of routine

911
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,520
tasks okay now finally I want to share

912
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,839
one thing that I'm kind of I've been

913
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,760
inspired by while talking to to

914
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,399
colleagues here and trying to study you

915
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,639
know Manufacturing Systems all over the

916
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,639
world and it's a system of skill

917
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,040
development that is a public good so in

918
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,079
the United States we we've struggled

919
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,079
over a long time because we've invested

920
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,000
in higher education as a public good and

921
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,200
we've invested in in uh K12 education as

922
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,720
a public good but vocational training

923
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,160
has never been a focus of um of national

924
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,160
public goods investments in the United

925
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,000
States whereas they have been in places

926
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,760
like like Germany and to some extent in

927
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,359
Japan so when I talk to colleagues about

928
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,880
how this company that I mentioned

929
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,839
earlier to the West making parts for

930
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,440
medical devices how they had a skilled

931
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,800
Workforce that with a high school

932
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,599
education people could be building

933
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,640
custom machines they said well in

934
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,920
Japanese high schools you graduate with

935
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,880
a level of mathematics and Engineering

936
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,520
understanding that the gap between you

937
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,280
and someone in college isn't that

938
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,440
significant that you can collaborate

939
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,119
with engineers and you have a shared set

940
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,720
of language and principles that's not so

941
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,359
in the United States however there are

942
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,720
some experiments that I find very in

943
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,320
inspiring and they're in some I'd say

944
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,280
unlikely places so this is just an

945
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,720
example of a machine tool company

946
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,359
actually the largest American Machine

947
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,920
Tool company called H which is based in

948
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,720
in Ohio um they've partnered with

949
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,040
regions around the country to develop

950
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,960
essentially you think of them as many

951
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,560
technical colleges and one that they

952
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,839
developed I would say among their most

953
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,280
successful is in Easter Eastern Kentucky

954
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,400
and if you've never been to Eastern

955
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,599
Kentucky I imagine not many of you had

956
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,800
it's a very uh struggling part of the

957
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,000
United States it used to produce coal um

958
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,599
there's a lot of problems with drugs and

959
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
there's a lot of crime um but what this

960
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,800
organization has done is they've taken

961
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,440
people who might have been struggling

962
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,280
used to be coal miners um had families

963
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
that are very low income and they've

964
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,359
brought them into a manufacturing

965
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,960
environment and treated them as if they

966
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,119
have a lot of mechanical skills and

967
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,119
talents to offer offer and ultimately

968
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,200
through just a several month training

969
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,839
process they find every single person

970
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,960
who goes through the program a job

971
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:38,800
actually a high wage job mostly in

972
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,119
Machining professions working with

973
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,680
robotic automation at a network of

974
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,720
companies in the region and this is I

975
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,520
think an exciting story because it's

976
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,119
among the You' think of the hardest

977
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,200
populations to train and position in in

978
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,480
these types of jobs but nonetheless this

979
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,079
organization has done it with now

980
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,079
hundreds and hundreds of students from

981
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,160
all backgrounds and all ages

982
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,520
so I I look forward to you know figuring

983
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,160
out ways to replicate this type of model

984
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,680
um to support more skill development at

985
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,119
other manufacturers in the United States

986
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,200
so thank you so much for your time and

987
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,200
I'm happy to take your

988
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,040
questions I'm going to read these

989
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:21,720
questions like the previous speakers as

990
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,119
you mentioned manufacturing jobs are

991
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,640
with low wages also the salary in Japan

992
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,319
is too much lower than the United States

993
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,560
for the same job title and duties

994
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:32,640
in your opinion how do you keep

995
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:36,640
employees motivated to keep progress so

996
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,680
what I would say about wages so maybe

997
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,119
I'm looking at some of the different

998
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,680
data the gap between Japanese production

999
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,599
wages U and American production wages

1000
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,839
isn't that big the gap between

1001
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,079
engineering wages I think is much more

1002
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:51,960
significant however what what I'm going

1003
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:55,359
to focus on is this High variation in

1004
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,960
wages within American manufacturing so

1005
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,800
the four companies that I talked about

1006
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,720
at the beginning all of those are very

1007
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,160
high wage firms I was emphasizing where

1008
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,920
they're located they're operating in

1009
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,599
high wage environments and they're still

1010
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,240
competing so how I look at these

1011
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,119
examples is they prove they're kind of a

1012
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,599
proof of concept that you can find a way

1013
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,480
of producing with high wages and high

1014
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,599
prod with high enough productivity to

1015
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,800
justify paying your workers well and

1016
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,800
motivating them to

1017
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,240
contribute could you speak to possible

1018
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,200
transition ideas is while workers are

1019
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,319
being reskilled unskilled which would uh

1020
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,680
make the break in employment more

1021
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:39,200
attractive so so this is um a challenge

1022
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,800
that in the United States we faced a lot

1023
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,760
in the 1980s and 90s where there were

1024
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,240
and even you know the 2000s when there

1025
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,440
were a lot of layoffs particularly from

1026
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,000
offshoring uh due to NAFTA or China's

1027
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,200
entry into the WTO so there was a

1028
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,760
program that has since been been uh

1029
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,480
studied and and found to be uneffective

1030
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,680
called the the trade adjustment

1031
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,520
assistance program where the idea was to

1032
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,160
Res skill people whove been laid off

1033
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,119
from manufacturing jobs um luckily we

1034
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,920
have a high demand for American

1035
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,000
manufacturing workers there's you know

1036
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,839
anywhere between 500,000 and a million

1037
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,839
manufacturing jobs that are open

1038
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,160
unfilled at any given time in the United

1039
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:19,640
States over the last several years so

1040
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,720
the idea of being reskilled I think

1041
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,200
there there could be someone who has a

1042
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,160
job in manufacturing and is being um

1043
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,319
trained at the same time so that would

1044
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,760
be a smoother transition

1045
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:33,760
the other point I'll make here one of

1046
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,280
the reasons we think Americans are so

1047
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
resistant to automation or pessimistic

1048
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,800
is because there isn't the same level of

1049
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,920
job security and government support a

1050
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,480
social safety net for American workers

1051
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,200
so if we look at places like France

1052
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,520
where we wouldn't necessarily anticipate

1053
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,720
workers to think differently about

1054
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,560
automation French workers are so much

1055
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,680
more optimistic about the impact of

1056
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,440
technology on their jobs and I think one

1057
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,400
potential explanation is the social

1058
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,960
safety net in France is a lot stronger

1059
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,200
so workers are less worried about being

1060
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,200
laid

1061
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,920
off with the new Trump Administration

1062
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,359
it's a great start to any question um

1063
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,960
what do you think of future the future

1064
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:15,319
of American Manufacturing in the short

1065
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,839
and long term and how would it affect

1066
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:18,119
other countries manufacturing such as

1067
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:20,760
China or

1068
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,520
Japan

1069
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,240
so as as I imagine everyone knows Trump

1070
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,480
Administration is very new it made a lot

1071
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,040
of promises uh during the campaign about

1072
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,040
how it would um impose tariffs on other

1073
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,280
countries um these

1074
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,839
tariffs I'm still skeptical that they

1075
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,400
are going to be imposed in the way that

1076
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,560
the Trump Administration promised I

1077
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:46,040
don't want to speculate now what I can

1078
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,720
say is that the tariffs in 2016 looked

1079
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,480
really bad on paper and actually did

1080
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,520
affect certain industries but how the

1081
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,440
administration implemented the tariffs

1082
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,440
was to offer many exceptions so really

1083
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,760
what they created was a lot of

1084
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,560
personalistic power for the government

1085
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,240
that so they can control which companies

1086
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,640
got exceptions to the tariffs and which

1087
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,359
didn't so the tariffs on paper might

1088
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,040
look bad and then you see all the large

1089
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:11,520
uh companies that are importing from the

1090
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,079
com the countries with tariffs getting

1091
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,800
exceptions so they don't face tariffs at

1092
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,800
all so it's more of a I think a

1093
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,440
personalistic strategy there um I have a

1094
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,599
lot of uncertainty about this as well

1095
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,040
I'm following it very closely um clearly

1096
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,280
the the words of the current

1097
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,440
Administration are that they care about

1098
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,000
manufacturing and want to see it grow uh

1099
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,079
I don't think that tariffs are the way

1100
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,960
to do that um so I am a bit concerned if

1101
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,920
if any of the the proposed policies come

1102
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,920
into action uh in a serious

1103
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,200
way continuous training will help with a

1104
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,560
skills Gap how much continuous training

1105
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,920
is needed as we need workers and lack

1106
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:56,400
the ability to always be thinking about

1107
00:41:51,920 --> 00:42:01,000
training okay so the continuous training

1108
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,000
is important and what I think is is let

1109
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,119
me let me step back and say the issue

1110
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,079
with training within companies is that

1111
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,760
you know there are some old papers that

1112
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,440
lay this out very effectively that

1113
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,920
companies will always systematically

1114
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,560
underinvested training partly because

1115
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,280
they don't want to train workers who end

1116
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,040
up um going to their competitor firm and

1117
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,800
using all the skills they developed at

1118
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,800
the company so companies we can't rely

1119
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,640
on companies alone to give workers the

1120
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,000
skills that they need particularly in an

1121
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,640
environment with high turnover so what

1122
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,119
do we do I think that's when I talk

1123
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,920
about public goods that's what I mean

1124
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,960
that really there need to be public

1125
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,680
goods for training that can support all

1126
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,760
workers in a certain industry or all

1127
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,880
workers in a certain area such that they

1128
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,480
have the skills to support to to uh

1129
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,000
provide a pipeline of very uh capable

1130
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,960
workers in uh in a particular region so

1131
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,200
these are I think Regional training

1132
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,119
ecosystems and Regional training

1133
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,880
infrastructure that can be that can help

1134
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,200
solve the problem that the question uh

1135
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,640
posed

1136
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,640
thank you very much
