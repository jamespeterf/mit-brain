1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
culture is one of those topics that

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,400
thankfully we all know something about

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,879
this is because we're surrounded by

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,519
cultures throughout our lives and we're

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,800
actually shaped by them in important

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,639
ways we grow up in households with

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
cultures we grow up in towns and cities

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,920
and states and even our Nations have

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,359
cultures in our work organizations there

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,279
in many cases very visible symbols of

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,519
culture but the deeper levels of culture

12
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,080
really are deeply held beliefs our

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,160
ideologies or values let me give you one

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,640
example and that's the Seal of MIT you

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,200
see a man with tools and then you see

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,680
one man reading a book and that

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,399
illustrates this men's atmus which means

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,760
mind in hand and what this represents is

19
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,960
some of the ideals of mit's Founders

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,520
that our education has very practical

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,039
value so this very visible manifestation

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,079
of mit's culture actually has very real

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,399
and and deeper meaning for more MIT

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,920
