1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,200
It is uh my pleasure to introduce our

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,920
next speaker uh Morgan Andrea. He is the

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,720
executive director of the future energy

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,119
systems and the MIT NE Alliance at the

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,320
MIT Energy Initiative which is

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,279
affectionately known as Mighty. So let's

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,920
let's give a warm welcome for Morgan.

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,519
>> Thanks Jim. Uh, good morning or I guess

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,200
good afternoon everybody and I know

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,719
we're getting really close to lunch so

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
I'm going to try to move this along

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,800
quickly. Um, thank you to Jim and the

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,559
ILP team for giving us a giving me a

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
chance to tell you a little bit about

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,440
some of our activities in the data

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
center space.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,120
Um, I did want to explain a little bit

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,559
about mighty the MIT energy initiative.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,280
We are an umbrella group that tries to

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,039
work with industry to sponsor research

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,080
on campus on energy topics. We're not a

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,920
department and that's by design

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
recognizing that a lot of these energy

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,400
topics are interdisciplinary and cut

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,400
across many different departments and

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,439
groups. And so the uh motivation behind

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
creating our group was to try to create

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,080
uh a focus on some of these energy

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,080
topics and and create the ability to

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,479
pull in the right resources. So we work

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
with researchers in pretty much every

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,200
department across campus on energy

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
topics whether it's engineering,

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,280
fundamental physics and chemistry,

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,799
economics, policy, um all different

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
aspects.

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,000
data center power challenge. As we focus

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,119
on energy, one of the big topics right

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,280
now that's getting a lot of attention is

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,439
uh energy topics related to data

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,280
centers. And there's there's multiple

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,960
different dimensions of this topic,

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,880
which makes it complicated, which makes

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,840
it an interesting problem for us to work

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,000
on. Um for the last 15 years or so,

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
there has not been a whole lot of growth

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
in electricity demand in the US. Um

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
there's a variety of different reasons

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,160
for that, but that is changing in the

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,440
last couple years. And I think one of

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,040
the the elements that's really driving

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,520
that demand is uh more demand for data

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,879
center power. Uh probably 10 years ago,

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
a lot of the data centers that were

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,519
getting built were

56
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:38,640
somewhere in the 10 to 30 megawatt size

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,840
scale. um today much much bigger and I

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
think it's not just uh electricity for

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,519
data science there's also a lot of

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,879
electricity for other applications

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
uh EV uh decarbonization of

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,760
manufacturing

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,640
um a variety of other uh demands

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,280
electrification of buildings um and

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,239
again this is a paper from Lawrence

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,959
Berkeley but there are projections that

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,200
in the next 5 years or so demand for uh

68
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,120
data center power as a as a fraction of

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,040
the whole US electricity demand could

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:21,319
grow to somewhere between 6 to 12%. So

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,319
that's a a big increase.

72
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,680
Uh and again I think this uh this

73
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,120
demand growth um raises a lot of

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,959
questions. I think there have been a

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,640
number of different uh

76
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,440
periods over the last 20 years where new

77
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,599
technology in the software space has

78
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,080
created a lot of excitement, a lot of

79
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,560
investment. I'd say this one is a little

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,799
different in that it's driving a lot of

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,599
investment in hardware and in equipment.

82
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,599
Um, and if you look at the lower left

83
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,120
chart, that sort of shows where we're

84
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,400
seeing a lot of this investment. And I

85
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,879
think there's a talk coming up later,

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,840
but it's it's a lot of big investment

87
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,720
from the big tech companies. Um, it's

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,879
not all evenly distributed. It is

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,200
concentrated in a few different places.

90
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,720
If you drive around Northern Virginia,

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,239
it is amazing the amount of of new

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
construction

93
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,040
with these these massive sites. Um, and

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
that's just a picture of one in Lowden

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
County, Virginia, which is a little bit

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,199
west of DC. Uh so that's one of the big

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,639
focus areas for building out this this

98
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,160
infrastructure. Um but I think as we see

99
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
this infrastructure getting built out

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,960
that does raise lots of complicated

101
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,400
questions. How are we going to deliver

102
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,120
that power when our grid isn't set up to

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,280
to manage those loads?

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,199
How do we meet the demand? How much

105
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,560
power is really uh going to be needed? I

106
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,120
think there's still some uncertainty

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,000
there. When is it going to be needed?

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,919
Where are we going to have that load?

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,639
What's the impact of putting that load

110
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,479
in different places? Um and and how does

111
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,880
that interact with the grid? So, I think

112
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,720
those are all complicated questions. Um

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,560
we're trying to pull together again

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,759
researchers across campus. We are doing

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,080
work on these topics today. Um and we're

116
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,479
creating something called the data

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,320
center power forum. We're going to

118
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,520
leverage some of the consortium work

119
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,960
that we're already doing and try to pull

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,840
together industry partners to sponsor

121
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,639
work in this area and address some of

122
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,120
the critical cross-disciplinary

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,280
questions that I think are really

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,280
important here. And I think you know

125
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,400
ultimately our goal is to help um

126
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,360
identify what are the big challenges and

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,800
help our members understand what are the

128
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,120
the uh potential solutions, what are the

129
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,520
trade-offs, what are the complexities

130
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,720
and hopefully also have some influence

131
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,600
on policy makers and building consensus

132
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
across industry to define the path

133
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,560
forward. And again, we're not an

134
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,479
advocacy group, but we are trying to

135
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
make sure people have the best

136
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,919
information possible when they make

137
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,479
decisions on these these um topics

138
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,520
that'll influence our power system for

139
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,600
the foreseeable future. This is just a

140
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,600
snapshot with lots of words on it and

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,720
I'll just highlight a couple points. So

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,160
it's these are existing projects that we

143
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,759
have today on a lot of the relevant

144
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,600
topics on infrastructure on the supply

145
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
of energy.

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,120
Where do we put those data centers? that

147
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,000
has a big impact on the supply side of

148
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,199
the question in terms of what resources

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,039
are available in different locations and

150
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,560
and what's the the impact on emissions

151
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,000
of putting your data center in Northern

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,160
Virginia versus West Texas versus the

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,199
Pacific Northwest.

154
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,440
the electricity uh grid in those

155
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,840
locations is quite a bit different and

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,599
so the overall impact um you know we can

157
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,960
see very different impacts with those

158
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,680
those sighting choices. Um looking at at

159
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,840
grid management and design

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,199
um as we were just hearing about cyber

161
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,000
security is a big issue resiliency

162
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,400
um is is critical particularly for the

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
data centers. I I think one of the

164
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,120
things that we are going to face is as

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,840
we're bringing on all of this new load

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,000
um how do we do that in a way that

167
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,120
doesn't disrupt the stability of the

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,560
rest of the grid particularly with some

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,039
of the the hyperscalers being committed

170
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,319
to sustainable power. Right? I think

171
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
we're likely to see a lot more

172
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,160
renewables coming online. But again, how

173
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,720
does that impact resiliency and and our

174
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,479
ability to have firm power? Um, and

175
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,160
again, as as I mentioned, a lot of this

176
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,240
ties into policy questions. And so we

177
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
work pretty closely with the Sloan

178
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,000
School with policy experts here on

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,599
campus to try to identify some of these

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,800
these questions and look at um you know

181
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,199
what happens when we put power uh a new

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
big load on the grid. What are the

183
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
options? Are there options where we can

184
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,240
put it behind the meter? Is that a

185
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,360
faster way forward to enable us to meet

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,599
that power demand? Does that negatively

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,320
impact the grid if we suddenly have a

188
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,880
bunch of loads behind the meter and we

189
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
don't have some of our our big power

190
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,000
companies participating as actively in

191
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,240
the grid for everybody? If we put it on

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,480
the grid, who pays for those upgrades to

193
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,279
transmission? So these are all questions

194
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,040
that are that are complex and I think

195
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,120
figuring out the right path forward

196
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,080
again will have a have a big impact on

197
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,839
our energy system and and certainly I

198
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,320
think a lot of topics around

199
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,959
infrastructure whether that's the design

200
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,519
of the buildings whether that's um

201
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,519
looking at how do we supply backup power

202
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,480
how do we optimize the energy storage

203
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,880
with UPS and backup power together um

204
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
can we be smarter about how we design

205
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,600
some of those systems to make them more

206
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,880
robust. And and I think one of the big

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:35,040
questions again that gets into computing

208
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:37,920
and uh data center design and um a

209
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,839
number of different use cases is what

210
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,279
kind of flexibility do we have in our

211
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:47,600
computing and do we have what's the

212
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,080
opportunity with flexibility to optimize

213
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,760
our investment in our energy system. So,

214
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I think that's a really complicated

215
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,200
question that again our our researchers

216
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,040
are excited to to dig into. I think

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,760
there's a lot of other questions here

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,800
that we're digging into and looking at.

219
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,640
I'd be happy to to talk with any of you

220
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,839
afterwards if you if you want to talk

221
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,240
more. I would like to uh point out two

222
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
of our our team members, JJ Laidus and

223
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
Deep Da who's going to be our program

224
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
manager um who are also here and we're

225
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
happy to chat with any of you later. But

226
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,560
again, like I said, the the whole point

227
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,360
here is to try to bring together

228
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,120
industry partners and researchers to

229
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,760
address some of these these really

230
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,800
complicated interesting questions.

231
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,800
Um, with that, I'll pause for questions

232
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,200
and maybe give back a little bit of

233
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,200
time. Yeah.

234
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,800
Traffic Arabi AMD on your forecast for

235
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,040
power demand. I wonder like uh at what

236
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,120
point do you think nuclear power would

237
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,200
become maybe the only or the most

238
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,560
lucrative option for data centers?

239
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,480
>> Great question. Um I think there's a lot

240
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,399
of interest in nuclear as a pathway for

241
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:10,240
uh lowcarbon firm power. Um we're seeing

242
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,440
a lot of investment um by some of the

243
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,320
hyperscalers uh and some of the big

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:21,600
utilities u in expanding the capacity of

245
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,440
existing nuclear sites. I think the only

246
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,480
there's two big challenges with nuclear.

247
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:31,200
One is the cost. Two the timing in order

248
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
to bring a new facility online. I I

249
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
think there's a high probability that

250
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,959
we'll see more nuclear in the pipeline.

251
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,839
Current administration seems to to uh

252
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,560
support it. Um I think it'll happen, but

253
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,519
I do think the the time for us to bring

254
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,880
those loads online is 5 to 10 years. I

255
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,279
mean those those that capacity online 5

256
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,000
to 10 years the data centers are getting

257
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,320
built today. So, I think it's it's just

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,360
not we're not going to be able to bring

259
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,279
that new power online

260
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,079
quickly enough in the form of nuclear. I

261
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,040
think it's probably a lot easier to

262
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,320
bring solar online more quickly,

263
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,600
although it is not as currently in in

264
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,600
fashion with the the current

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
administration.

266
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,519
>> Hi, uh Gene Vincent Avon, thanks for the

267
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,360
talk. Really good. You mentioned there's

268
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,800
some particular areas where there's a

269
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,279
lot of construction going on and you

270
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,839
said specifically like Virginia I think.

271
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,920
So what's driving that? Why? And then

272
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,600
the talk we heard before you was okay

273
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,600
maybe we want to build it somewhere else

274
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,200
where it's cooler. I didn't see any big

275
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,639
dots in in those areas. So

276
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
>> what what's going on? Why can't we drive

277
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,959
it to be in the right spot?

278
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,000
>> Yeah. Uh I mean I it's I think happening

279
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,079
in a couple spaces for good reasons for

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
for rational reasons let's say not maybe

281
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,959
not good for rational reason. So in

282
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,959
Northern Virginia there's scale with a

283
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,519
lot of the infrastructure and the um

284
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,920
skill sets needed to build a new data

285
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
center. So when you go to build a new

286
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,639
data center in Lowden County or Fairfax

287
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,120
County or further out in near Co Pepper

288
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
or one of those towns, you just call

289
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
somebody up and say, "Hey, we're

290
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,440
building another data center. They've

291
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,760
got all of the skilled workforce right

292
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,399
there ready to do it. They've just built

293
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,079
10 data centers. One more. No big deal."

294
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,800
So not every area of the country has

295
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,639
those skills and sort of the

296
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,839
not quite as easy to deploy them. I

297
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,240
think there are some other areas of the

298
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,240
country that have um they've

299
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,320
from what I understand from a regulatory

300
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,120
perspect perspective made it a lot

301
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:54,320
easier to bring new power online and um

302
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,040
and and made it favorable to site some

303
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,040
of the data centers in terms of

304
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,399
economically providing power fairly

305
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,800
quickly. I'm thinking of Texas in

306
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,600
particular. Um, I think there's no

307
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,240
reason we couldn't put some of these

308
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,639
data centers in other locations and

309
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,600
there might be some advantages

310
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,519
um to doing that, but it would require a

311
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,399
um, you know, proactive, thoughtful

312
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,399
policy approach,

313
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
which again we hope to inform with some

314
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,000
of this work. So, thank you.

315
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,000
>> Okay, let's hear it from Morgan.
