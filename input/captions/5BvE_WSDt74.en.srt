1
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,560
And so next we have Susan. Um,

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,199
>> you need the clicker.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
>> I do need the clicker. I don't need the

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,439
pen.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,559
>> It's about the MIT project. Wow, that

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,079
was fantastic. Uh, I also want to add my

7
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,559
voice uh to this chorus, my voice and my

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,960
colleagues voice. And to start by

9
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,280
thanking uh Zenab and this incredible

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,760
group that's joined here today and to

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,039
say that you all are pioneers. You know,

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,600
we've been I've been so moved by so much

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,280
creative work by so many leaders in the

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,600
field that have been brought together.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,199
It's truly remarkable. And so thank you.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,479
Uh I'm going to introduce to you the MIT

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,280
thermal energy network or mitten plan

18
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,760
for rapid costeffective decarbonization

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,680
of MIT campus. Uh it is the work of MACA

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,320
MIT campus group. MAC stands for MIT

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,600
alumni for climate action in

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
collaboration with GIO at MIT which is

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,520
the student group that we've worked

24
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,920
with. Maka was founded in 2018. The idea

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,680
for a thermal energy network for MIT

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,159
campus uh uh goes to Rick Clemensy, a

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,439
colleague of uh uh Garen um Eubank, who

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,640
we heard from earlier. Uh Rick and Judy

29
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,159
uh won a climate collab competition uh

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
that MIT sponsored in 2016. Um but it

31
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
didn't go anywhere. MIT wasn't

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,000
interested at the time in listening to

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,399
that. Um we we picked that up at MIT. Uh

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
the Maka group picked up that idea and

35
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,360
have built on it for the past three

36
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,439
years and we just introduced it formally

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,440
in a class that I t taught um this past

38
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,360
week uh and in an hourong presentation

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,840
which has been reduced to 10 minutes for

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,040
today. So, moving along, MIT's

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,520
decarbonization challenge is that 97% of

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,319
MIT's greenhouse gas emissions are from

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
the operation of its buildings and 26%

44
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,360
of all of Cambridge's greenhouse gases

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,400
are from MIT.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Um, MIT has had two climate action plans

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,560
in 2016 and 2021 um which postponed

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,760
significant investment in direct campus

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,480
decarbonization until later. uh its

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,519
emphasis in the early years 2020 up to

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,200
2040 and going on is uh power purchase

52
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,400
agreements uh in the Midwest uh and um

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,160
and mainly the power purchase agreements

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,959
um but uh it it hopes for um some major

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,959
breakthroughs uh in the future um and is

56
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,480
going to put you know is is there there

57
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,840
are voices uh among this chorus at MIT

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,959
who would like to see um uh small

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,360
nuclear reactors or deep geothermal uh

60
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,760
at some future point when it becomes uh

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,040
a reality.

62
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,760
The MIT thermal energy decarbonization

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,159
plan is an all electric campus fueled by

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
carbon-f free power. It implements

65
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,319
energy conservation measures including

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
waste heat recovery from ventilation

67
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,799
systems to reduce heating and cooling.

68
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,360
We're installing high efficiency water

69
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
source heat pumps in each building

70
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
distributed

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,879
um for heating and cooling. It

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,000
repurposes the existing chiller loop to

73
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,560
an ambient loop circulating 45 to 85

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
degree water year round to water source

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,360
heat pumps in each building. It

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,439
repurposes the oil tanks at the CUP

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
central utilities plant for thermal

78
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,319
storage. And there are energy transfer

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,400
stations operated by the Cambridge Water

80
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,439
Department exchanging heat with the

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,159
ambient loop where possible and if not

82
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,040
then looking to the MWR and and the

83
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,519
wastewater sewage or drilling uh

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,600
geothermal bore holes.

85
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,880
The plan is the most cost-effective and

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,840
energyefficient way to decarbonize the

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,080
campus. It demonstrates MIT leadership.

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,560
It leverages MIT's investment in

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,040
existing infrastructure. It eliminates

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,440
the cost impact of maintaining separate

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,240
systems because the water source heat

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,639
pumps uh provide both heating and

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
cooling. It eliminates energy

94
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,600
transmission losses, enables the capture

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
of free energy where there is concurrent

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,720
heating and cooling on campus and

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,440
perhaps will tap into future um

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,560
subsidies. Uh the Met building already

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,600
demonstrates this uh and this that that

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
demonstration is underway.

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,440
How is the campus heated and cooled now?

102
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080
It has a central utilities plant with

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,720
co-generation. It produces steam and hot

104
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,759
water. It operates on a steamdriven

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,000
chiller. It generates over 22 megawatts

106
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,120
of electric power connected to steam

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,680
distribution connected to chilled water

108
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,000
distribution to most buildings and the

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
cooling load is high and most affected

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,039
by global warming.

111
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,560
Decarbonization issues with the existing

112
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,440
plant. The the grid decarbonization is

113
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,919
rapidly reducing carbon once added for a

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,560
combined heat and power.

115
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,280
Fossil fuel backup is necessary.

116
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,039
Efficiency of 50 to 55% source to

117
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,880
output. Low turndown rate of about 30%.

118
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,759
High thermal losses in the seam

119
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,919
distribution system of 10 to 20%.

120
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,520
nonzero losses in the chilled water

121
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,120
system of 5 to 15% and also the hot

122
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,600
water district system have losses also

123
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
um and hot water is what MIT's

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,919
administration is currently uh seeming

125
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:11,360
to embrace for its uh favored uh

126
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,520
geothermal um pathway pathway option.

127
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
How would the mitten plan heat and cool

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,000
the campus? Uh, distributed heat pumps

129
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
connected to a network of sources and

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
sinks. No one solution since the

131
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
buildings range over a history of

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,319
hundred years. Use of building

133
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,600
tobuilding and building inbuilding

134
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,479
sources and sinks. Use of thermal energy

135
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,759
storage and ground coupling with as I've

136
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,240
said Cambridge water, sewer or uh ground

137
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,000
thermal exchanges.

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
We consider this a fifth or sixth

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,680
generation district HVAC decarbonization

140
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,240
transition with an ambient loop,

141
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,000
two-pipe system, exhaust recovery,

142
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,160
distributed water source heat pumps,

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
thermal storage, air source heat pumps

144
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,039
and ground heat exchange, municipal

145
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,960
water thermal and other

146
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,680
uh and the chiller loop to the ambient

147
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,160
loop conversion. uh we would use the

148
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,440
same two pipes that exist already. Uh

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,199
first of all the blue uh buildings have

150
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,880
currently chiller loop. Uh oh and I

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,840
didn't say we have um MIT administration

152
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,160
uh provided us with a memorandum of

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,720
understanding uh to test fit our idea to

154
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,520
six buildings and those six buildings

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,160
are uh here uh W20 is the student center

156
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,720
and the rest are the athletic complex

157
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,199
W31 to W35

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,160
and three of those buildings have the

159
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,639
blue buildings have the Chillerloop loop

160
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,599
uh but the other three do not. So our

161
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
plan would for the test fit would

162
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,680
require the chiller loop to be added to

163
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
these three excuse me the ambient loop

164
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,960
to be added to these three buildings as

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,400
represented by the green dots were our

166
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,199
our uh proposal for these buildings

167
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,400
expanded to the whole campus. It's we

168
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,160
would also need an ambient loop here. Uh

169
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,440
those are the only two places that we

170
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,479
would need to do work. And I meant to

171
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,319
say uh that here are the six buildings

172
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,599
um on a graph of the EUIs of a number of

173
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
the buildings, not all the buildings,

174
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,520
but most of the buildings. And MIT has

175
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,319
very high EUIs with the lab build oops

176
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,039
with the lab buildings being uh

177
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,680
backwards. Uh the

178
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,959
um the the worst the worst uh performing

179
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,959
buildings. Uh and what's interesting is

180
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,480
that these six buildings represent a

181
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,800
quite

182
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,320
uh the huge a huge span of uh the campus

183
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
uh current u EUIS.

184
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,160
So

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,399
uh this is where uh in W33 the ambient

186
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:05,440
loop would run

187
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,720
and this is uh the cluster from above um

188
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,279
uh on which uh the ambient loop that you

189
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:17,839
just saw would be running uh from the uh

190
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,959
chilled water loop uh connection through

191
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,720
uh what you just saw and through this

192
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,839
building and into this building and also

193
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,519
into W20. We would also put uh solar

194
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,360
collectors on these wonderful flat roofs

195
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,200
that are uh hidden from view. Uh and we

196
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,320
would

197
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,760
um put on the roof of W20, the student

198
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,399
center u multistack heat pump units

199
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,200
where there's already space for that. We

200
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,600
would put as one option multistacks in

201
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:57,040
W34 as well. Uh perhaps another option

202
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:00,560
would be the AON SA23 in W34.

203
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,360
And then uh to compare um a central

204
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,000
plant fourpipe distribution system as is

205
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,360
being proposed. You can see uh that

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,079
um MIT currently has uh installed hot

207
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,440
water pipes in the Sloan complex. It

208
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,880
represents about 15% of the campus. Um

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:26,480
and the consultants plan would require

210
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,560
hot water pipes uh with I believe 180 to

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,640
they call it low

212
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,560
temperature pipes but not so low. Um 180

213
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,440
to 240 I believe uh degrees Fahrenheit

214
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,800
hot water in these pipes and all of this

215
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,920
would need to be um uh installed. And of

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,519
course that would need need steel pipes

217
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:55,680
and insulated pipes uh as opposed to the

218
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:57,600
ambient loop uh small areas here.

219
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,120
The

220
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,320
central thermal plant has heat losses in

221
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,040
transmission. Uh it starts off with a

222
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,320
lower CO cop

223
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,760
uh and Mittens has uh limited um heat

224
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,399
losses because of each heat pump being

225
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,399
in the building itself.

226
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,040
So to sum up uh a kind of topline

227
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,279
comparison of approaches um both

228
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,480
approaches meet building HVAC specs.

229
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,120
Both approaches achieve zero emissions.

230
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,720
uh our approach achieves those emissions

231
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,440
by 2035 were we to start this year uh

232
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,519
with a pilot on the existing six

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,399
building complex.

234
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,640
Uh ours is minimally disruptive as you

235
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,240
saw with the ambient loop only needing

236
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,320
to be extended in a few places. Uh we

237
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,320
need a pilot to confirm our projections

238
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,320
and to learn as the heat ever source uh

239
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,000
demonstration has learned uh a

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
tremendous amount. We need to do that

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,959
learning on the MIT campus by a real

242
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,600
project. It's easy to upgrade over time.

243
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,440
It's fiscally responsible and it's unc

244
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,040
clear whether MIT will seriously

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,279
consider our our proposal.

246
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Uh our proposal we call a thermal

247
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,360
transition um leapfrog and we'll take

248
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,959
would go from the existing chiller plant

249
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,800
to a distributed energy network. So

250
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
finally, at the end of the day, the

251
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
project is not just about public

252
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
relations, but it should result in real

253
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
progress. The central utility plant will

254
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,079
play an important role in the mitten

255
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,160
solution. Our plan is available now.

256
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,240
We're using off-the-shelf equipment.

257
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
It's cost-effective. It will eliminate

258
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,440
carbon emissions and be minimally

259
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,920
disruptive. We feel that we can show the

260
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,560
world and demonstrate to other campuses

261
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,200
not only in Boston area or across the

262
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,680
North America but around the world that

263
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,279
this is a an approach that is

264
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,760
cost-effective, rapid and doable. um

265
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,000
MIT's the world's leading research

266
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,519
institute and should do something that's

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,560
not just uh cut cookie cutter um that

268
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:16,079
other campuses have already done um like

269
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,440
Princeton or like Stanford um and um

270
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,279
that is a centralized approach um and we

271
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,040
need to do a pilot and advocate for that

272
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,399
um for 2020 2025 so that we can get to

273
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,399
net zero by 2035.

274
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,720
And I'll close with uh words of Sally

275
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,040
Cornblath at her inauguration. Climate

276
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,880
change and its mounting consequence is

277
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
the greatest scientific and societal

278
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,920
challenge of this or any age. We need

279
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,680
energy and expertise from every MIT

280
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,079
school and college and from every lab

281
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,959
and every center from every member of

282
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:55,360
the faculty and from every one of you.

283
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,160
Um so um thank you and uh I think I want

284
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
to end really with this slide. We want

285
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,800
to get there by 2035.

286
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,800
And uh we're asking MIT when can we

287
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
start
