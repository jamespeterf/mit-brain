1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,377
I was in high school, I think I was a

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,461
sophomore in high school,

3
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,422
they bring in these consoles,

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,466
they were the TI-99s that you could

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,301
connect to a television

6
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,637
and they had a keyboard and

7
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,598
there was a program called BASIC and

8
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,975
that's where I programmed

9
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,560
my first solution of the

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,603
quadratic equation and

11
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,105
it just blew my mind.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,610
So what was typical is that Argentina had

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,820
a very, very strong

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,447
public education system

15
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,658
going all the way from actually

16
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,952
pre-school, which is where

17
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,037
I met my wife, all the way

18
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,664
to finishing college

19
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,332
The engineering program was six years.

20
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,544
So I have 21 years of public free

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,254
education, it was a very

22
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:48,840
strong focus on educating yourself.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,969
During the dictatorship it was tough, it

24
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,803
was assumed that if

25
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,054
you were Jewish you were

26
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,390
communist, which you know couldn't be

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,058
further from the truth in case of my

28
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,351
father, but you know we

29
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,979
would get calls at 3am in the morning

30
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,689
saying nasty things,

31
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,566
intimidation, that sort of thing.

32
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,402
Then we had democracy, it was great.

33
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,699
I studied civil engineering there and I

34
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,201
met my mentor Eduardo

35
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,495
Dvorkin, who is actually a PhD

36
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,164
from MIT. He's the one who inspired me to

37
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,999
pursue graduate studies

38
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,126
in the US. You know for me

39
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,755
what he had done and this world that he

40
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,298
was opening to me was

41
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,217
like a fantasy, I mean it was

42
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,719
like unreal. You know I had finished my

43
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,388
PhD at Caltech and I

44
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,349
started interviewing for jobs.

45
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,976
The day I said that I got an interview at

46
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,145
MIT, the butcher in my town

47
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,066
knew that I was going to MIT

48
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,569
to interview for a job position, everyone-

49
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,782
day. But there is no doubt

50
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,700
that the US is so special

51
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,745
and a place like MIT is so special. It

52
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,372
was very unique in

53
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,706
terms of opportunities.

54
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,586
Someone like me with my broken accent, at

55
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,129
some point I ended up in congress

56
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,925
talking to a bunch of senators about

57
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:18,096
military helmets and how they were safe

58
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,308
to protect against blast injuries. I got

59
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,893
US senators listening

60
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,063
to me, okay. And there is

61
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,608
a sort of excitement associated with it.

62
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,361
Then you feel that you don't

63
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,947
just work on things you like,

64
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,658
that you know you get the opportunity and

65
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,118
the privilege to work on

66
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,452
the kinds of things that

67
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,746
you like to do and they pay you for it.

68
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,666
You can make a living out of it. It's

69
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,543
that somebody cares.

70
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,088
You have something to contribute, this

71
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,008
country will gladly take

72
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,594
and value it and value you.

73
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,182
We are never satisfied with how we do

74
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,894
things. We're always revisiting what we

75
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,186
do. In my department,

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,983
every 10 years there is a new exercise to

77
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,819
revisit everything we do, from education,

78
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,864
you know, not take ourselves for granted.

79
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,657
I think that's very important.

80
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,621
What I respect the most about this

81
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,122
community right is their

82
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,374
commitment to excellence,

83
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,543
academic excellence, scholarly

84
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,046
excellence. But you know

85
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,380
this is a sort of excitement

86
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,301
that this place breathes

87
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,595
and makes it so interesting.
