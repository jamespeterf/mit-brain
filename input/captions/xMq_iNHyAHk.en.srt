1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm going to discuss today if we start

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,880
the slides uh nuclear reactors place

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
replacing gas turbines and of course the

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,039
reason why is the largest source of

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,359
electricity in the United States is the

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,760
natural gas turbine uh it's relatively

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,920
cheap furthermore it can go up and down

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,480
like a yo-yo which happens to match

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,560
power demand I'm going to give a very

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,039
broad view first a broad view of what

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
the option space is and then I'm going

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,880
to drill down on some technologies that

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,680
we've been working on at o at at uh MIT.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,360
Next slide.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,520
Whoops. I'm the guy who controls this.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,039
Now, there are four technologies that

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
can produce dispatchable electricity

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
from a nuclear power plant and replace

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,840
the gas turbine. The first, you can run

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,760
the reactor power at variable levels.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
The second, you can you can have a base

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
load reactor with heat storage in a

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,680
power cycle. The third, you can have a

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
base load reactor with a thermodynamic

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
topping cycle. I'll explain what that is

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,000
a little bit later. And the fourth, you

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,240
can have what they call cogen, of which

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,479
the cogen that's probably most important

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,400
is a base load reactor with a hybrid

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,119
system that produces electricity and

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,360
hydrogen. But th those are the four

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,439
options you've got. If there's a fifth

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,520
option, I would love to hear about it.

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,920
Uh starting point, the electricity grid

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
is changing. historical grid, high

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,280
capital cost, low operating cost, space

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,119
load power plants, uh, low capital cost,

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
high operating cost, dispatchable power

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,200
plants, gas turbines, the new grid, lots

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,159
of non-dispatchable electricity. Solar

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,520
wind is wind is when the sun is out when

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,040
uh when it when it blows. And right now,

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,119
of course, the rest of the grid is gas

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,759
turbines and nuclear power.

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,600
Now it's important to understand exactly

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,040
what's happening to the the electricity

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,880
market. Uh and the thesis I have here is

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
that variable price of electricity

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,680
creates incentive for energy storage.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,080
This happens to be the 2023 California

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,440
wholesale electric prices. The vertical

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,599
axis is 24 hours in a day. The

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,280
horizontal axis is 365 days in a year.

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,280
And all those different colors are the

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,200
different colors represent different

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,599
prices of electricity at different

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,040
hours. And what is noteworthy in

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,640
California is there's a whole bunch of

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,319
hours with negative price electricity.

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
And then there are other hours of the

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,760
time time of the year where you have

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
really expensive electricity. And what

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
that says is there's a need for a

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,599
dispatchable electricity that sells when

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,120
the price is high and maybe buys

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,120
electricity when the price is low.

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,920
Now let's take a look at the options for

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,920
nuclear power plants. Let's start with

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,360
the oldest option. Operating reactors

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
at part load to meet variable

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,519
electricity demand has been fun done for

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
decades.

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,040
Old technology

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,959
standard offtheshelf uh France has been

75
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
doing for 40 over 40 years but a number

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
of other countries have also done it.

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
you just reduce the power level of the

78
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,200
reactor when the power demand goes down.

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
Uh the problem with this is it it costs

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,040
a lot of money to build a nuclear power

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,599
plant and you'd rather not operate it at

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,879
part load uh if you can make beneficial

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,360
use of full load capacity. So yes, it's

84
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,400
doable. It's off the shelf, decades and

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,400
decades of experience.

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,720
The second option is a base load reactor

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
with heat storage in the power cycle. Uh

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,959
this is what I call a first generation

89
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,440
commercial for nuclear. Uh store hot and

90
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,440
cold nitrate salts or other other

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
liquids. Uh there are of course a

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,360
variety of advanced options that are

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,239
currently under development.

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,000
Uh today hot and cold nitrate salt

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,640
thermal energy storage is used in

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
concentrated solar plants. concentrated

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
solar plant. You have a big tank of cold

98
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,680
salt. You send it to the concentrated

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,079
solar plant, heats it up, and you dump

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,400
the hot salt into a hot storage tank.

101
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,320
Separately, you have a power cycle.

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,759
Steam power cycle takes hot nitrate

103
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,919
salt, runs it through the power cycle,

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
generates steam electricity, dumps it in

105
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,280
the cold tank. Uh this was developed for

106
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,320
CSP to reduce capital costs. Uh the

107
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,919
solar power solar input peaks in the

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
middle of the day. You don't want to

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,680
size your power plant for peak output.

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,360
So what you do is you size the power

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,320
block for average uh power output and

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,040
you let the salt tanks go up and down uh

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,440
daily. So the hot salt tank fills up in

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,000
the middle of the day and it goes all

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,800
the way down as you approach evening and

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
into into the night. It also allows of

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,639
course electricity after dark. And the

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
picture on the right shows one of the

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,080
commercial plants. And you can very

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
easily see the two salt tanks because

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,080
they're they're big and the most obvious

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,039
things on site after the mirrors.

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
Now, the same technology enables base

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,560
load reactors to provide dispatchable

125
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
electricity to the grid to replace gas

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
turbines. Base load reactor on the right

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,160
takes cold salt, heats it up, dumps it

128
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,720
into the hot salt tank. uh the power say

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
power plant takes the hot salt makes

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,960
steam makes electricity and dumps the

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
salt into the cold tank. Now if it turns

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,520
out you have negative priced electricity

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,680
or very lowriced electricity the same

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,400
system would take electricity off the

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,280
grid if it's negative priced why pass up

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,919
a bargain and heat up more nitrate salt

137
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,720
to make hot salt whenever the price gets

138
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,479
too low.

139
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
Now, Terrap Power is constructing the

140
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,199
Natrium reactor in Wyoming. This will be

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,120
the first reactor with nitrate salt heat

142
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
storage about 5 and a half hours.

143
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,400
Variable output if you ran this plant at

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,639
pace though to be 345 megawatts. The

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,600
actual power output is between 100

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,039
megawws and 500 megawws. And of course,

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,440
the name of the game is to deliver

148
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,080
electricity to the greater time at high

149
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,479
prices. It's in Wyoming at a coal plant

150
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,600
site for one very good reason. They have

151
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,160
a power line to California, the land of

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,960
highriced electricity, which makes this

153
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,360
an extremely valuable site. But you have

154
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,840
a minimum assured output of 345

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,960
megawatts all the time.

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,120
That's current state-of-the-art.

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Now, what's new? We've been looking at

158
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,600
adding a steam accumulator that may

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
enable going from 100 megawatts to 500

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
megawatts

161
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,000
in less than 15 seconds. In other words,

162
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,479
instead of a slow ramp capability on

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
your steam plant, we're going to have a

164
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,000
fast ramp capability. So, if the grid uh

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
needs power in a hurry, we can deliver.

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
The grid pays for these services, for

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,000
these auxiliary services. And what a

168
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,120
steam accumulator is is a big tank of

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
steam and you get the push button push

170
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
the button and what happens is that

171
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,360
steam accelerates up the turbine

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
generator in the power plant while

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,639
you're very rapidly in 15 seconds to

174
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
full power. At the meantime the hot

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
nitrate salt is going through the boiler

176
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
and the boiler is making steam but that

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,840
takes 5 to 10 minutes to start up. So

178
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,080
this is a fast start mechanism if there

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
is a demand by the grid for a fast

180
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,639
start.

181
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,599
Uh, we're not exactly talking about a

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,880
brand new technology. Here we see a

183
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,919
picture of the 1929,

184
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,080
yes, 1929 Charlottburg power station in

185
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,560
Berlin state-of-the-art accumulators

186
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,160
uh, heat water and pressurized in

187
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,759
pressurized vessel with steam, release

188
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,680
pressure, flashing steam to turbine, uh,

189
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
produce electricity. This steam

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,560
accumulator was about 1 hour output. It

191
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,400
was fired up or loaded up, I think is

192
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
the right term I would use, with a coal

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,879
power plant that was sitting right next

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,840
door. So, we're sort of deciding to

195
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,120
marry 1929 technology with something a

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,639
little newer application. And by the

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
way, the common use of steam

198
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
accumulators that you're most familiar

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
with is the Navy uses them to launch

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,440
airplanes off of carrier decks. you

201
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,840
know, you need a lot of power for about

202
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,599
five seconds.

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
And so the steam flows into the piston

204
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,319
and the piston goes roaring down the

205
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,360
track and your airplane hopefully is

206
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,599
airborne uh a few seconds thereafter.

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,159
Uh as mentioned, fast ramp capability

208
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
provides anxillary services opens up new

209
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,159
markets, data centers, defense

210
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,200
applications about 15 second response

211
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,839
time. In comparison, high-speed hydro

212
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,440
start is 90 seconds, five minutes for

213
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,519
gas turbines, and 15 seconds for diesel

214
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,360
generators. So, it's an alternative for

215
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,720
fast start diesel generator.

216
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
Now, I should mention there are actually

217
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,680
three generations of heat storage

218
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,440
technologies. Uh we're on generation

219
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
one.

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,320
Generation two's pilot plants are being

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,120
built. And then there's generation

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,120
three. And the whole goal here is to

223
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
knock down the capital cost further and

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,360
further. Uh generation one of course is

225
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,640
commercial. We're working on generation

226
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
three and I'm going to give you some

227
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,200
picture of what these advanced

228
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,200
technologies look like. Third generation

229
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,320
crush rock ultra-large heat storage

230
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,399
systems enable long duration storage.

231
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,480
Now when you think about storage, what's

232
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,360
important is it be cheap.

233
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
That's the criteria. And so if you want

234
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,560
cheap materials, so far we found the

235
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,160
cheapest material is crushed rock. If

236
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
you find a cheaper material, please let

237
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
me know.

238
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,519
And we're working on developing a

239
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
crushed rock storage system. Initial

240
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,200
work at MIT. It's at a technological

241
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
readiness level of a little over four.

242
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,480
So it's early in the game. And we have a

243
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,880
self stupporting

244
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,760
stack of crushed rock

245
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,440
20 30 40 meters high,

246
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,200
20, 30, 40 meters wide. and very long.

247
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,600
And we want want to heat it up. We have

248
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
a bunch of hot nitrate salt that we put

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
drains down on top on sprinklers and

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
trickles on through the crushed rock to

251
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,839
the pad below.

252
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,959
To get our heat out, we throw cold

253
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,839
nitrate salt on top. Trickles on down,

254
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,920
gets heated up, goes to the power plant.

255
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
Now, that sounds very simple. There's a

256
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,079
few minor complications which is why

257
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,480
it's a technological readiness level

258
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,560
four, but it eliminates where the big

259
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,200
cost is on the existing systems. It

260
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
eliminates the salt, replace it with

261
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
crush rock. The salt's only used for

262
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,800
heat transfer agent. And it replaces a

263
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,360
tank with something that looks like an

264
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,360
aircraft hanger.

265
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,519
And here's again a second summary. Uh

266
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,079
hot salt trickling through crushed rock

267
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,680
recover heat by cold salt trickling on

268
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
top. a little more complicated than

269
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
that. And the other thing is it's a

270
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
freestanding rock pile.

271
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,839
It's got some other internals to make

272
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,440
sure the edges don't the rocks don't

273
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
roll down the edge. That's important

274
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,360
because tanks are expensive and we want

275
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,000
to put this into what amounts to an

276
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,880
insulated aircraft hanger. They're

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,680
cheap, but this is the nature of

278
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,920
storage. Cheap is better. And if you get

279
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,399
cheap enough, you can do seasonal

280
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,000
storage. Uh this is a case for Texas

281
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
where we assume the nuclear plants you

282
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,800
have you have 30 gigawatts online and

283
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,600
200 gawatts electric equivalent in

284
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,480
storage for every gigawatt nuclear you

285
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,480
have. And the chart here on on the right

286
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,399
shows the amount of heat in storage as

287
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
you go over the year. In the winter time

288
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
you have a winter peak suddenly the

289
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,839
amount of heat storage goes down. When

290
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
summer comes the amount of heat in

291
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,360
storage slowly goes down over the summer

292
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,880
months and then it rebuilds in the fall.

293
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,360
It's an option for potentially seasonal

294
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
storage and to eliminate all fossil

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,200
fuels, but recognize the technological

296
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,279
readiness level is four.

297
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
Our second option

298
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,040
is base load nuclear reactors with

299
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:16,240
thermodynamic power peaking cycles that

300
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,760
is convert lowriced electricity to heat

301
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,480
and use it for a power cycle.

302
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,720
Well, what is a thermodynamic topping

303
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,639
cycle? I'm going to give you an

304
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,079
explanation. I'm not sure if it'll fly

305
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,440
if you don't have an engineering degree.

306
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,120
I apologize for that. Um, the starting

307
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
point is that the heat to electricity

308
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
efficiency increases with the

309
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
temperature of the working fluid in the

310
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,959
power cycle. The steam temperature is

311
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,279
higher, the gas temperature is higher.

312
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,240
As the temperature goes up, the

313
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,480
efficiency of the system goes up.

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
And a power topping cycle is you add

315
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,959
high temperature heat to boost the

316
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,320
temperature of the of the power fluid

317
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,240
above that of the reactor coolant.

318
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
Lightwater reactors with steam cycles,

319
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,000
you double the output if you turn it

320
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,680
into a peaking cycle. Higher temperature

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,480
reactors, you use something called a

322
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,200
nuclear air braen cycle. The requirement

323
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,760
is is that the added heat for peak power

324
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,360
has to be at a much higher temperature

325
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,040
than the reactor fluid is.

326
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Now, let's take a look. As you can see,

327
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm a good historian here. Back to the

328
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,600
future again. Nuclear thermodynamic

329
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,200
topping cycles are a 1960s

330
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,480
technology.

331
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,040
It's better than 1929.

332
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Indian.1 PWR.

333
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,680
The steam exited this plant at 270

334
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,880
degrees C. It then went into the hot

335
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,839
air. It then went into a superheater, an

336
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,839
oil fired superheater. a boiler

337
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
effectively that raised the steam

338
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
temperature to a higher temperature of

339
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,959
540 degrees C before it went to the

340
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
steam cycle. Much more efficient way of

341
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,480
doing business and very low capital

342
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,120
cost. Now what killed this plant is the

343
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,040
price of oil went up. I don't know if

344
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,800
you remember it but you had the 1960s.

345
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,639
this plant was built in the 1970s. You

346
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
had the oil embargo and the price of oil

347
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,079
went through the stratosphere and this

348
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,639
plant was uh half oil and half half

349
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,199
nuclear and that got killed by the the

350
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,199
price of oil. It was when it was built

351
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,120
however the most efficient oilto

352
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,959
electricity plant in the world. The

353
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
incremental oil generated more

354
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,920
electricity at a higher efficiency than

355
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,959
any of the competition.

356
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,040
Uh this shows uh the basic cycle. You

357
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,760
got feed water, nuclear reactor, normal

358
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,240
conditions, steam to super heater, stere

359
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,320
heater, you add additional heat, run the

360
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
temperature way up and that goes to the

361
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,160
steam turbine and I show the power

362
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,079
cycles below for those who have an

363
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,279
interest. If you take a modern

364
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,279
lightwater reactor, GE or Westinghouse,

365
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,760
uh you can essenti peak power will be

366
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,279
about equal to the base load electricity

367
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,720
that you're producing. So if you're

368
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,639
producing a thousand megawatts you put

369
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,399
on the peaking unit, you get another

370
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,079
thousand megawatts for peak power.

371
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,440
There's an equivalent air nuclear air

372
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,880
braiden cycle. I'm not going to go

373
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
through it. This is for higher

374
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,040
temperature reactors. The slides will be

375
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,040
available so you can read the fine print

376
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,040
and it also has my email so you can send

377
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,199
me an email if you have questions about

378
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,560
it.

379
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,920
Now how do you provide that high

380
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,760
temperature heat? Option A, burn fuel,

381
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,199
natural gas, oil, bofuels, hydrogen.

382
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,519
Option B, convert lowpriced electricity

383
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,079
to on the right to very high temperature

384
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,680
heat. That's the option we've been

385
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,000
working at and then use that heat for

386
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,000
peak power.

387
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,480
We can convert lowric electricity into

388
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,079
high temperature heat stored in fire

389
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,680
brick.

390
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,360
A nice technology invented by the

391
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,560
Hittites about 500 BC.

392
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,880
Needs a little modification. We blow air

393
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,040
through channels in the fire brick to

394
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,560
deliver heat as hot air to the customer.

395
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,360
And we show the cycle here where they

396
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,079
have fire brick in a silo, cold air in

397
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,160
the bottom, hot air out the top. We heat

398
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,759
the fire brick by electricity. So it

399
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,880
could be wind, solar, nuclear, whatever

400
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,399
your low price electricity is. Uh the

401
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,240
system has a characteristic that it

402
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,560
delivers hot air to the customer which

403
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,320
means if we run out of heat storage we

404
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,560
can add an auxiliary combustible fuel

405
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,079
oil, gas, bofuels, hydrogen to make uh

406
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,120
to keep on running at whatever

407
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,040
temperature we want.

408
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
Now why are we choosing fire brick?

409
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
Well, firebrick is the only cheap high

410
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,199
temperature material and we currently

411
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,680
have gigawatt hour heat storage

412
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,680
technologies used in glass plants. When

413
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,360
you're making glass, plate glass, and

414
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,639
plate glass, you have this glass furnace

415
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,480
at the top and the cold air, there's hot

416
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,600
hot air goes over it, heats the glass,

417
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,959
and then the cold exit air at a

418
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,880
temperature up to,500 Celsius, about the

419
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,079
melting point of iron, goes through a

420
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,000
sixstory fire brick structure, deposits

421
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,480
his heat in the fire brick, and then

422
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
comes out cold at the bottom of that six

423
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,079
story thing on the left and goes up the

424
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
stack. Every hour they switch the fan

425
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,799
direction. Cold air goes up through the

426
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,079
fire brick.

427
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,600
Then you pour on the natural gas and it

428
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,720
goes into the glass furnace. So we have

429
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:31,520
the technology to store heat cheaply at

430
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,760
a 1000 C if we have a way to heat the

431
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,840
fire brick. The rest of the technology

432
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280
is commercial.

433
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,200
Uh what we did is we invented

434
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,559
electrically conductive fire brick to

435
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
enable lowc cost high temperature

436
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,520
heating. Uh fire bricks is a mixture of

437
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,520
oxides, cheap oxides. We add a dopant

438
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,039
about 1 or 2% of something like nickel

439
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
to make it an electrical resistance

440
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,360
heater. The brick is an electrically

441
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,360
conductive and electric conductive

442
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,679
surface between the bricks so we can use

443
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,120
it as a resistance heater. And we have a

444
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
startup company called electrified

445
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
thermal solutions run by my former

446
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,559
graduate student who's in the process of

447
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,280
commercializing the technology.

448
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,720
Here we show traditional uh electrical

449
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,400
heaters on the left. uh 1100C if you

450
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
really push it on the right the fire

451
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,919
example of a fire brick heater

452
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,120
essentially it's a brick wall you look

453
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,720
you want to make a fire brick heater

454
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,200
it's you could lay it like a brick wall

455
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,600
that's you know foot or two feet high

456
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,600
you put current through it away you go

457
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,039
as you can see you get up at the

458
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,840
temperatures we're at it's actually

459
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,760
white hot

460
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,640
and a demo is going to start next month

461
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,120
in uh in the Southwest Research

462
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,880
Institute and you can see some of the

463
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,679
crew in front of want a small demo

464
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,960
that'll do 5 megawatt hours up to up to

465
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,240
uh 1,700 C. If we can pull it off,

466
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
that's of course the big question

467
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,640
because it's still in development. Uh it

468
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,440
means we may have a cheap way to eat up

469
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,880
all the world's cheap electricity.

470
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
Uh you ain't going to you're going to

471
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
sell electricity less than the delivered

472
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,480
price of natural gas or oil. If there's

473
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,919
electricity at less than that, we want

474
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,760
to eat it all up every last kilowatt

475
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,080
hour

476
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,280
and turn it into hot air for commercial

477
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,919
and industrial products.

478
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,200
Well, let's now take a look at the third

479
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,039
option. Hybrid energy systems that is

480
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,919
the co-production

481
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,919
of electricity and hydrogen. This is a

482
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,440
type of co-generation.

483
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,600
Uh the reason I'm talking about this

484
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,919
specific one is the potential scale of

485
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,679
the industry. One of the issues of

486
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,440
co-generation reproducing industrial

487
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,760
heat and electricity to the grid is

488
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,000
who's your customer and what constraints

489
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,000
do they have? It may be that they can't

490
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
go up and down and power demand very

491
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,080
much and so they're essentially a base

492
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,120
load electricity generator. So this is

493
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,400
the the last of the technologies that

494
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,720
can convert a nuclear reactor into the

495
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
equivalent of a gas turbine.

496
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,240
lowcarbon world uh the hydrogen demand

497
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,880
for the chemical industry may exceed 750

498
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,400
million tons a year. Now when I'm

499
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,520
referring to the chemical industry is

500
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm referring to people who need

501
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,440
hydrogen to run some chemical reaction.

502
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,960
We do not assume a single kilogram

503
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,880
is used to heat anything.

504
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
So this bunch of customers doesn't care

505
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,919
about the heating value of hydrogen. It

506
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,600
cares about the chemical properties.

507
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
Obviously ammonia production that feeds

508
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,440
half the world. Uh you know three

509
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,360
hydrogen atoms and one nitrogen atom. So

510
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,280
you need a lot of hydrogen. The second

511
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,480
is if you decide to decarbonize the

512
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,120
steel industry, you replace uh coke and

513
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,600
coal w with hydrogen as a chemical

514
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,840
reducing agent that pulls the oxygen out

515
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,240
of the iron oxide as water to get iron

516
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,320
to for your steel process. The third

517
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,760
option is liquid hydrocarbons from

518
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,840
solistic biomass which on paper can

519
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,679
replace every single barrel of crude oil

520
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,000
on the planet oil on the planet earth.

521
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,880
By the way, silosic biomass is the part

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,039
of the plant you don't eat. Leaves,

523
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,440
trees, grass, kelp,

524
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,799
it's not corn,

525
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,039
you know, it's it's not a protein

526
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,400
vegetable oil. This is a stuff you can't

527
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,120
eat. The rest of the plant that is

528
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,919
non-eable uh with a single exception of

529
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,080
celery, that's the only kind of uh

530
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,159
cellulose that people actually eat. But

531
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,080
of course it has zero nutritional value

532
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
because as a human being turns out your

533
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,640
body doesn't know how to take out the

534
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,320
energy value from cellulose.

535
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
What we can do is build nuclear reactors

536
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,440
to switch from electricity to hydrogen

537
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,559
and back and export the electricity to

538
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,120
the grid. Uh the important part about

539
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,000
this is it turns out hydrogen on a large

540
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,320
scale not a small scale large scale is

541
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,919
very cheap to store. And what that means

542
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,000
is if we have variable hydrogen

543
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,080
production, we can guarantee steadystate

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,520
hydrogen production to the chemical

545
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,320
plant. And that's really important for

546
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,320
the chemical plant operators.

547
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,480
Okay. Okay. Now, the most efficient

548
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,640
nuclear hydrogen production method is

549
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,559
high temperature electrolysis. The

550
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
nuclear reactor provides steam and

551
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,320
electricity.

552
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,720
uh this creates the option of diverting

553
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,799
electricity to the grid at times of very

554
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,480
high electric prices. So our nuclear

555
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
reactor is most of the time producing

556
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,000
hydrogen and when the price of

557
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:35,679
electricity gets high we switch the

558
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,520
electricity to the grid.

559
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,720
This system works for chemical plants

560
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,360
because hydrogen on a large scale not a

561
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,679
small scale on a large scale is cheap to

562
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,520
store. Very important distinction.

563
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,080
Hydrogen on a small scale is really

564
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,559
expensive to store. Really, really,

565
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,039
really expensive. That's a separate

566
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,720
discussion.

567
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,320
Here's the system. Hydrogen storage

568
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,720
enables peak electricity to the grid

569
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
with steady state delivery of hydrogen

570
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,000
of a base load reactor.

571
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,919
We want to make life boring for the

572
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
reactor operators.

573
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,640
Boring is good if you're running a

574
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,159
nuclear power plant. Preferred mode of

575
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
operation.

576
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,320
We can send variable electricity to

577
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,880
produce hydrogen and heat. We can also

578
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,039
produce heat that goes to the goes to

579
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,520
the industrial sector. And if the price

580
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,200
of electricity is high, we stop

581
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,760
producing hydrogen or reduce hydrogen

582
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,080
production and shove a few gigawatts

583
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,000
into the dispatchable electricity

584
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,919
market.

585
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,799
But it works because hydrogen is

586
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,120
storeable on a larger scale. So we can

587
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,880
keep the chemical plant guys happy.

588
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,280
Chemical companies do not like shutting

589
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,919
down chemical plants. And the reason why

590
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,400
having worked done startup on chemical

591
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,360
plants is that sometimes it takes two or

592
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,360
three days to get restarted.

593
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,280
And uh this is not fun. You do not want

594
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,679
to be on a startup crew of a chemical

595
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,600
plant. 12-hour days not fun.

596
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,039
And of course it's means you're not

597
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,880
generating any product which means the

598
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,600
chemical company's equally unhappy when

599
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,440
this happens.

600
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,559
Now, the hydrogen requirements if you

601
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,400
want to actually do this, 750 million

602
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,799
tons a year. Now, remember, we're

603
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,720
talking about fertilizer, steel, and

604
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,520
replacing every single last barrel of

605
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,440
crude oil.

606
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,080
So, we're talking about decarbonizing

607
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,480
about 40% of the global demand, global

608
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,320
of the global economy. Not a trivial

609
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,279
task. If we use nuclear reactors, we

610
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,320
were going to need 3200 gawatts,

611
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,880
3200 large plants, which means we can

612
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,080
also deliver 3200 gawatts of peak power

613
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,200
to the grid on demand, which far exceeds

614
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,240
the world's demand for peak electricity.

615
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,080
Alternatively, if we have wind, all we

616
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,400
need is two million square miles

617
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,559
of high quality,

618
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,400
lowcost great plains wind.

619
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,159
Now, we don't have that much in the US.

620
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,799
Globally, I'm not sure. These are global

621
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
numbers, but that's the scale. Or if we

622
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,000
want to take natural gas, we only want

623
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,720
to convert half the world's natural gas

624
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,360
production into hydrogen

625
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,480
and sequester the carbon dioxide. But we

626
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,400
decarbonize 40% of the world. Uh the

627
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,799
largest industrial user of course would

628
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,520
be the bofuels operation in this

629
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,520
specific case.

630
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,559
Now some conclusions.

631
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,640
There there are four ways for a nuclear

632
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,960
reactor to replace gas turbines.

633
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,520
Four technologies, four different ways

634
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,559
of thinking about the problem.

635
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,320
The technologies are rapidly changing.

636
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,159
They're advancing very quickly and as a

637
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,000
consequence, I'm afraid I can't give you

638
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
a prediction of what which are going to

639
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,960
be the winners and which ones are going

640
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,880
to be the losers. My suspicion is that

641
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
different technologies will prove

642
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,799
superior in different parts of the world

643
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,279
with different electrical grids and

644
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,440
different constraints. So that's the

645
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,799
overview. I will stop now and open up

646
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,799
for any questions you might have.

647
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,440
Remember you can get the slides. I think

648
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,840
you can get the slides and uh it's got

649
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,200
my email on it. So you can send me a

650
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,600
note if you want and I'll be happy to

651
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,080
send you more reports than you ever

652
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,480
wanted to read

653
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,760
that go into the gory details of the

654
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,559
major options we've discussed here in

655
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,559
>> well thank you Charles

656
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,760
this was quite enlightening I always

657
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,120
thought that energy storage is based on

658
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,159
batteries but you just gave me

659
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,840
completely different ideas

660
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,360
>> batteries the expensive option

661
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,720
>> the expensive option if it costs more

662
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,679
than crushed rock I have something

663
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,520
against it

664
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,720
>> are here. Any questions? So, we have a

665
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,000
microphone. If you want to ask a

666
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,200
question, I'll I'll pass it on to you.

667
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,520
>> Okay, good.

668
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,159
>> Just in terms

669
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,159
in terms of cheapest version. You mean

670
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,320
sand in terms of because I I've heard of

671
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,679
that solar heating battery with sand

672
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,679
>> sand is one of the competing

673
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,640
technologies and uh that's probably

674
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,559
requires hot air rather than liquid

675
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,720
liquids in it. The reason has to do with

676
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,400
something called capillary action where

677
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,799
when you put some liquid through sand it

678
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,120
tends to hold hold up in the sand and

679
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,120
not flow through. So it's a that's a

680
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
technical detail but it's if you're in

681
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,480
sand you probably in a gas heat transfer

682
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
because of something called surface

683
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,840
tension. You have a question you catch

684
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,440
me later and I can explain why that

685
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,120
probably is going to sink that option

686
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,120
for liquid heat transfer.

687
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Graham,

688
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,799
>> thank you. Thank you very

689
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,799
>> Thank you very much. This is a wonderful

690
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,159
presentation. I really like it. You

691
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,480
mentioned about pneumonia. Ammonia, I'm

692
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,039
sorry.

693
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,799
>> Yes.

694
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,840
>> U in ammonia production, people can

695
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,559
leverage nuclear instead of other energy

696
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,799
sources. Could you comment like people

697
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,320
call it pink ammonia?

698
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,720
>> Can you comment? There there's a lot of

699
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,799
work on using ammonia for peak

700
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,520
electricity. And if you have to ship uh

701
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,360
an energy source over the ocean, uh

702
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,120
ammonia may be the cheap way to ship it

703
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,480
versus uh something like liquid

704
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,559
hydrogen. So if you're shipping a fuel

705
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,640
for marine applications in particular,

706
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,679
but also for peak power to places like

707
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,120
Japan, uh ammonia will be cheaper to

708
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,799
ship, much cheaper to ship than

709
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,039
hydrogen. And for that reason, the

710
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,679
Japanese have a program developing gas

711
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,120
turbines to burn 100% ammonia. That

712
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
ammonia will probably come out of the

713
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,640
Middle East where they take natural gas,

714
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,000
make hydrogen, make ammonia, and

715
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,440
sequester the carbon dioxide

716
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,360
underground. That's one of the

717
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,760
replacement options for exporting

718
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,679
natural gas from the Persian Gulf. My

719
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,880
guess is it might be the winning option,

720
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,240
which is a guess on my part.

721
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,799
>> Hi, very interesting. Sorry. Um, how

722
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,279
sensitive is the time? So, if you've got

723
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,919
sort of this uninsulated pile of rock,

724
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,440
what are the losses? You know, is it

725
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,840
hours or or days?

726
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
>> The the problem with with rock with

727
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,600
rock, we're still looking for for

728
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,200
somebody who's what what it's going to

729
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,000
take is going to take somebody who's got

730
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,399
a serious budget because I won't go into

731
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,960
the details, but because of the nature

732
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,200
of the process,

733
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,919
uh, your pilot plant has to be at least

734
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,760
six stories high of crushed rock in an

735
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,000
insulated building. And then you're

736
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,320
going to have the hot nitrate s salt and

737
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,279
the cold nitrate s salt. So this is not

738
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,120
a technology that you're going to get to

739
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,840
a commercial level if you have a $10

740
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,039
million budget. This is a hund00 million

741
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,399
development budget. Uh that's that's the

742
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,440
issue. And I think going in that you

743
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,360
just can't avoid that. Uh my guess is

744
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,080
what's going to happen on crushed rock

745
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,080
is the Chinese will do it first.

746
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,360
A, they have more need than anybody

747
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,399
else, and B, their bottom line is it

748
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,760
might work. We'll try it. I I don't know

749
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,240
if you're familiar with the Chinese

750
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,000
development strategy. They'll give you

751
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,279
the nuclear strategy. There were six

752
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,760
They bought five or six different kinds

753
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:20,240
of reactors from different vendors. Went

754
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,080
down to one. Try it out full scale.

755
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,480
Throw a thousand engineers at it. What's

756
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,480
the problem? We don't quite do it that

757
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,039
way.

758
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,360
A potential source of crush rock is a

759
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,600
mine mining operation. Would it make

760
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,360
sense to have a plant close to a mine?

761
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
>> Um

762
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
the problem is you have to be very

763
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,399
careful which rocks you choose. Many

764
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
rocks will not tolerate higher

765
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,039
temperatures and they certainly won't

766
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,520
tolerate nitrate salts. So you choose

767
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,840
the cheap rock that is in shippable

768
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,679
distance of where the facility will be

769
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,159
built. cheap rock that's chem chemically

770
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,279
compatible within uh so that that's

771
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,200
what's going to control this. It's

772
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,720
mostly going to be unless you're really

773
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,640
lucky and you happen to have the site of

774
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,039
the right rock, it's going to be the

775
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,520
logistics cost, the train cost to move

776
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,039
the rock. You're talking you're talking

777
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,399
about a big chunk of rock, you know,

778
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,200
okay, so it's only 200 meters long and

779
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,080
20 30 mters wide and 40 meters in

780
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,520
diameter. It's not. This is a big This

781
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,159
is a big construction project, but you

782
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,159
got to pick the right rock.

783
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,960
Super. Any other questions?

784
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
So, I have another question. So, when do

785
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
you think we're going to see some of

786
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,200
these technologies actually coming into

787
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,720
the market? And what's the adaptation

788
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,880
rate? What's

789
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
>> the electrically conductive fire brick?

790
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,480
That's a that's about two years out

791
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,440
because the pilot plant's starting in

792
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,760
December. So that technology for

793
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,120
electrically conductive fire brick

794
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,720
that's going to be commercial within a

795
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,640
year or two assuming we don't run into

796
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,000
problems on the pilot plant. The crush

797
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,000
rock is going to take a little bit

798
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,519
longer. um that probably the Chinese the

799
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,080
fast acceleration with the steam

800
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,159
accumulators depends upon somebody

801
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,600
having a problem where they where

802
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,120
there's a market that says I really want

803
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,840
to accelerate my steam plant quickly and

804
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,799
as soon as the market appears I have no

805
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,919
doubt that GE missishi

806
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,600
or seammens will be more than happy to

807
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,240
uh demonstrate the technology on your

808
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,240
plant it's you know this is going to be

809
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,720
oh you bought our steam turbine, how

810
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,519
would you like to buy option A as an

811
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,840
add-on because

812
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,760
it, you know, it's very tightly tied to

813
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,360
the control systems and the steam

814
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
turbines. So that I think the steam

815
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,039
turbine manufacturers are going to be

816
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,960
the the actual vendors in this case, but

817
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,559
they just got to wait until you see a a

818
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,519
big enough market to be worth the

819
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,279
prototype.

820
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,960
>> I have one final question before we

821
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,880
switch over to the next speaker on it.

822
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,000
So you as a research scientist here at

823
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,279
MIT, what do you need from industry

824
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,039
because you've been working all your

825
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,640
lifetime on these technologies?

826
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,360
>> What I need is good entrepreneurs who

827
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,360
have very deep pocketbooks.

828
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,039
That's that's the actual answer. By the

829
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,240
way, I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm a very

830
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,000
good inventor, but I'm not an

831
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,159
entrepreneur and I've always known that.

832
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,840
So that's not my skill set. So you're

833
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,840
I'm the wrong person to ask.

834
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,919
>> Yeah, that's great. All right. Thank you

835
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,240
very much, Charles. Uh really appreciate

836
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,240
it.
