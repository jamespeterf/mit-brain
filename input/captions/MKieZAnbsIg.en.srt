1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,040
good morning and thank you so much for

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,799
coming to MPG primer today um I am very

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,679
excited to tell you a bit about some

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,120
work we've been doing on amazing species

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,160
in my opinion um I want to tell you

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,080
about our comparative genomic strategy

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,840
to discover mechanisms of cellular

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,480
resilience in mammals um and if you've

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,800
come into the room and have just been

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
looking at these pictures I will

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,720
acknowledge that yes on the left this is

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,320
indeed the honey badger that don't care

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,840
um the honey badger among a bunch of

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,199
other species is one of the ones we

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,640
think is really exciting with regard to

16
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,280
Cellular resilience and what we can

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,920
learn from that and today I'm going to

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,399
be talking about a framework that we

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,480
have used to try or are using to try to

20
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,800
discover um those mechanisms across a

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
bunch of different mammals um I want to

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,800
start with the premise and the argument

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,199
that many human diseases result from um

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,399
instances of compromised homeostasis and

25
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:53,840
by that I mean there is something that

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
happens at the organismal level that

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,199
results in an organismal disregulation

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,440
of some critical physiological feature

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,199
um and

30
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,000
some examples that we may all have

31
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:05,880
encountered in some contexts are

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
temperature disregulation classically

33
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,040
fever or hypothermia um glucose

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,479
disregulation in the context of diabetes

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,960
or oxygen deprivation in the context of

36
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,680
obstructive pulmonary disease and in all

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,799
of these cases um there is a you know

38
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,680
wide range of severities but they are

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,240
all United by the fact that in the case

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,640
of extreme and prolong disregulation

41
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,799
there can be really apparent

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,560
consequences for cells that can result

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,439
in protein deter

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,119
and in some severe and prolonged

45
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,680
instances cell

46
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,720
death um many of the treatments that we

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,320
have for these these disease states are

48
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,280
uh aimed at restoring homeostasis and

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,439
normal levels at the organismal level so

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,119
in the context of temperature

51
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,880
disregulation the idea might be to take

52
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,479
some those hypothermic and warm them up

53
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,399
or take some those a fever and cool them

54
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,759
down um for gluc glucose disregulation

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,000
insulin could be used to restore typical

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,159
blood glucose levels and in the case of

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,520
oxygen deprivation to um pursue

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,399
interventions that will restore an indiv

59
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,000
individual to a normal level of oxygen

60
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,920
in which their souls can reside safely

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
um I think that one of the things to

62
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,280
keep in mind about this is that the

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560
reason we have to do all these things

64
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,680
and the reason these disregulation are

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,640
bad for human cells is that under normal

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,360
conditions human cells reside in a

67
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,000
pretty reliably good environment um and

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,480
so one of the sort of examples that

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,680
think is useful is to think about if you

70
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,239
are hiking in the cold your hands might

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,319
be cold you might be thinking GE I'd

72
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,200
really like a cup of tea but your body

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,800
temperature will stay right around 37c

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,000
in spite of being an environment that's

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,720
considerably colder than that even more

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
amazing I think is that that is a bir

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,760
directional tolerance so if you happen

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,000
to like hiking when it's hot out or in

79
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,319
places where you have to tolerate heat

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,720
to get amazing views in the desert or

81
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,040
wherever uh you will again find that

82
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,519
your body is staying at about 37 even

83
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,760
though the external conditions might be

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,159
much warmer than that um and I think

85
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,239
this is really interesting because it to

86
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,959
me suggests or indicates that humans are

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,360
uh really tightly controlling our

88
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,920
internal conditions and you know on the

89
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,799
one hand you might think that this would

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
be an easy problem to solve but it turns

91
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,560
out that um to do this at reliably at

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,120
population scale has for a long while

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,239
been quite difficult and many of us are

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,599
wearing on our wrists part of the recent

95
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,799
solution to that problem which is to we

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,439
uh various wearable devices that are

97
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,480
collecting temperatures over a long

98
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,159
interval and housemen at all back in

99
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,080
2018 used these as a data source to try

100
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,400
to begin to understand well how much

101
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,760
does human temperature variation really

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,280
how much is it a thing basically and so

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,439
um this is an interesting paper that

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,000
looks at a bunch of different

105
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,519
individuals but the overall um the

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,959
overall conclusion is that if you take

107
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,200
all those individuals you take means and

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,200
there's some interesting variation be

109
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,200
take means you'll find that yes indeed

110
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,079
there is variation in human temperature

111
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,439
over the course of the day but that bi

112
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,480
axis is pretty tiny and so you might

113
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,920
find if you were to wake up in the

114
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,319
middle of the night at 4:00 a.m. and

115
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,480
stick at the mometer in your mouth you'd

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,680
be at at around 36.2 on average uh you'd

117
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
be a bit warmer at 5:00 p.m if you did

118
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,560
the same thing so there is some dial

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,680
variation but again this is a pretty

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,360
small like one degree level level um

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Range but there are limits to this and I

122
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,800
was really struck um in a couple years

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,320
ago to see a New York Times feature

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,000
about exactly this and you know sort we

125
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,280
have evolved olved in um sort of through

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,199
human history in environments that have

127
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,160
certain limits on what temperatures are

128
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,120
typically attained in the environments

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,240
that we we live in um and this is really

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,600
striking to me that in some cases there

131
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,600
are now parts of the world where it's

132
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,720
not all that unusual for temperatures um

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,440
in places that humans live to get up to

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,960
100 like the well into the 100s

135
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,039
basically and even though again as I

136
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,720
said earlier we are usually working on

137
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,120
the systemic level to keep our internal

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
conditions thermally pretty constant

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
those conditions seem in some cases at

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,400
least to be sufficient to overwhelm us

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
and so as New York Times phrased it the

142
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,919
heat of the day can give you a fever so

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,680
basically not only is is sort of

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,400
excessive um body temperature a disease

145
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,880
state but it's now actually becoming

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,560
something that um is not all that

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,919
implausible as something that our

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,120
environments can impose on us as a

149
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,039
stressor um and so what does this what

150
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,120
does this mean um well I want to think

151
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,880
about what this means in terms of the

152
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,960
following statement which is that humans

153
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,039
are pretty weird in fact as I was

154
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,600
telling you earlier um if you're hiking

155
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,120
in the cold or if you're hiking in the

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,120
heat um your body is working pretty hard

157
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,440
to keep you at a constant temperature um

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,800
if you were a snake this would be less

159
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,639
likely to be true in fact as we all I'm

160
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,800
sure encountered way back in in

161
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,199
elementary or middle school biology uh

162
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,319
snakes are are um like reptiles in

163
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,720
general um very much conforming to their

164
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,919
their ambient uh the ambient

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,800
temperatures and so broadly speaking if

166
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,160
you crank up the temperature um that

167
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,639
your your um snake if you happen to have

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,759
a pet snake is living in the the snake's

169
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,440
temperature will go up as well and and

170
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,720
so uh snakes have behavioral strategies

171
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,160
of like seeking out sunspots in order to

172
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,360
to stay warm um and again that's because

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,000
they're not really working very hard at

174
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,680
all to keep their internal conditions

175
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,919
constant um but even even mammals even

176
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
among mammals uh we are weird I would

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,360
argue and so one of my favorite animals

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
which I sort of anticipated in the very

179
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,039
first slide with a few with a few photos

180
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,080
is the Dromedary camel and I love this

181
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,000
texture because the camel looks so

182
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
unaffected by whatever is going on just

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,240
just chilling there it turns out that if

184
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,560
you are a a Dromedary camel you have

185
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,720
some uh fluctuation in temperature that

186
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,680
is uh this has been known since that the

187
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,800
mid-50s that is very uh related to the

188
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,080
temperature of your environment and so

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,919
you know if if you think back to the

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,199
snake where which it was like basically

191
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,919
the snake is the temperature the

192
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
environment that's not quite as extreme

193
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,520
for the camel and so if it the camel is

194
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,520
in a freezing environment it's not like

195
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,039
the camel will freeze but you do see

196
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,000
some variation um in terms of the the

197
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,800
body the body temperature that's in

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
excess like 3.5 degrees which is in

199
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,599
excess of the dial variation I mentioned

200
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,319
earlier for humans where the the camel

201
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,360
is letting its body temperature vary a

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,199
bit and the sort of canonical thinking

203
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,560
about this at least is that this is has

204
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,360
evolved as a strategy for water

205
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,960
conservation and so you know if you're

206
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,800
human one of the ways you deal with

207
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,280
keeping or you achieve a constant

208
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,680
internal temperature in a hot

209
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,120
environment is to sweat um that's all

210
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,400
well and good if you have access to

211
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,479
water it's kind of a terrible strategy

212
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,159
if you don't have access to water and so

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,120
it seems like sort of an evolutionary

214
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,720
trade-off where where the camel is

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,680
tolerating um tolerating internal

216
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,080
variation in temperature as a way or

217
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,840
hand wavy but it seems to preserve water

218
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,159
um and it turns out camels aren't alone

219
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,560
either um if you are familiar with the

220
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,360
process of hibernation you'd also you're

221
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,120
also aware that there are many species

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,280
that kind of allow the op temperature

223
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,280
perturbations in the opposite directions

224
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,080
so um I featured two of my my favorite

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,680
groups here the the bats and a 13 line

226
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,199
BR squirrel both of which have really

227
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,919
really substantial temperature variation

228
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,479
um over over some cycle during the

229
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,080
winter and and this too is seems to be a

230
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,839
trade-off and so if you um hang out um

231
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
in the evening in the summer around here

232
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,000
you'll see and we all benefit from all

233
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,399
those bats that are hanging out and and

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
eating mosquitoes but it turns out that

235
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,399
come Frost and come the cold weather

236
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,160
around here there aren't mosquitoes

237
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,240
available and so um this is not the

238
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,399
species we have around here in

239
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,200
particular but um the the um the ability

240
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,959
to kind of hang out in the winter and

241
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,800
not need food by letting your metabolic

242
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,440
processes go into a a more depressed

243
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,160
state is actually a really good way to

244
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,640
deal with a lack of a lack of um a lack

245
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,360
of food um one thing that I'm not going

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,959
to talk about today that I think is kind

247
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,800
of interesting is the very different

248
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,920
patterns and this is just an aside but

249
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,839
it's it's something we want to know more

250
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,640
about of uh the temperature variation in

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,560
different species and so hibernation

252
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,720
isn't necessarily getting cold and

253
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,240
staying cold it's maybe as more in the

254
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,279
squirrel and here having these intervals

255
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
during which you're you're fluctuating a

256
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,160
lot but when you are really cold you're

257
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,880
saving all of the resources that you

258
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,040
might otherwise be investing in in

259
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,040
staying really

260
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,839
warm um so in light of this in light of

261
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
the camel getting really hot and in

262
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,040
light of the hibernators getting

263
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,839
impressively cold I would argue that

264
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,160
mammals exist along sort of a Continuum

265
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,480
of strategies for coping with ex with um

266
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,320
environmental variation and so as I was

267
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,640
mentioning before humans are kind of

268
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,760
weird on the left I would say that um we

269
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,320
have really strict homeostasis we work

270
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,720
really hard to keep things internally

271
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
the same and we do that at the expense

272
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,959
of water we do that at the expense of

273
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,640
needing to spend more energy to preserve

274
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,720
our our rather high body temperature

275
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,600
even when it's cold out um but if you

276
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,120
happen to be a camel or a squirrel or a

277
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,480
bat there are other resources that are

278
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,880
of greater value um in part just because

279
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,640
they're more limited in the environments

280
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,320
that those organisms live in either

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,839
because of their dietary habits or

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,839
because of water limitation in the case

283
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
of camel um and I would call these uh

284
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,399
species that are more on the end of

285
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,800
flexible homeostasis where they are

286
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,959
tolerating internal um internal

287
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,120
conditions that are variable now where

288
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,320
does this place the expense that those

289
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,839
organisms face and I would argue that

290
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,600
it's really sort of again a Continuum

291
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,760
between organismal mitigation and

292
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,160
cellular mitigation so humans are

293
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,519
working hard on systemic level but if

294
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,720
you happen to be a camel or a bat or a

295
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,360
squirrel it's actually your cells that

296
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,880
are directly encountering those variable

297
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,320
conditions and so um this really I

298
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,639
thought was really an intriguing thing

299
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,079
and in fact just as an aside that that a

300
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,160
graph I showed a couple um slides ago of

301
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,320
the camel having variation over the

302
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,720
course of the day was something I

303
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,279
actually encountered in an undergrad um

304
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,839
comparative physiology class and I

305
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,200
thought that was so cool because it

306
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,200
totally violated what I thought I knew

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,560
about mammals being very humanlike and

308
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,480
again I think this comes to sort of the

309
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,880
the downsides of having a human Centric

310
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,600
view which is we think we're normal but

311
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,920
we're weird mammals um and if you start

312
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,880
thinking about the the diversity in this

313
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,120
Continuum you suddenly open yourself up

314
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,839
to the possibility of thinking huh if

315
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,320
there are species where it's the cells

316
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,600
that mitigate the stressor then that

317
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,680
allows us to think about this whole

318
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,959
other set of questions which is

319
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,920
basically how do um Maman cells buffer

320
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,959
or cope with

321
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,560
stressors um and this opens up another

322
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,200
set of more specific questions um and

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,120
these are the three that we've tried to

324
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,160
use to frame our project right now

325
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,160
although I think as you'll see later in

326
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,120
the talk I'm beginning to realize that

327
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,279
these are not so readily addressable as

328
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I had hoped and that's where I would

329
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,760
love to have your your input on what to

330
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,240
do next because we are um we are we are

331
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,000
uncertain about where to go um so I

332
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,320
think there are you know this can be

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,959
broken simply overs simply into a bunch

334
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
of ways um one of them is which

335
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,279
responses are Universal across species

336
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,399
that is does it are there certain things

337
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,800
that you do regard of whether you're a

338
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,079
flexible um species like a camel or a

339
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,880
strict species like a human are there

340
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,880
responses that are unique to flexible

341
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,920
species that is are there things that

342
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,000
are um that the camel can do that we

343
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,800
can't um and finally which of those

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,920
responses drive all the others like is

345
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,480
there one that sort of precipitates in

346
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,600
any sort of way genomically or otherwise

347
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,440
the set of uh subsequent responses um

348
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,320
and I will say that I I will admit that

349
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,320
my interest in this comes from a very

350
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,880
basic biology perspective I just think

351
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,800
it's really cool that cells can do that

352
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,120
and I want to know why um but um since

353
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,480
we have tried to pitch this to NIH and

354
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,160
currently a funding from NSF um we have

355
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
challenged ourselves to think about what

356
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,639
this might mean in the context of what

357
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,880
is this what what might be the insights

358
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,120
for humans um and I really think um one

359
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,120
way to think about it is that instead or

360
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,680
of or complimentary to ideally um

361
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,639
strategies that are meant to sort of

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,040
um improve conditions at the systemic

363
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,440
level for States disease states of

364
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,959
temperature glucose or oxygen

365
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,639
disregulation a complimentary strategy

366
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,839
if we can learn from other mammals about

367
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,320
what their cells do that is special and

368
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,079
awesome um we might actually find ways

369
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
to intervene to promote cellular

370
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,199
resilience and so you know if you can't

371
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,399
necessarily totally um normalize blood

372
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,839
glucose or you can't normalize

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,680
temperature are there other things that

374
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,880
we can do uh that will protect cells

375
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,800
even in a in a more variable environment

376
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
than they typically than they typically

377
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,839
live in and this comes from again an

378
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,800
evolutionary perspective that we may not

379
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,279
be drawing on these on these mechanisms

380
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,160
as part of our the typical lives of

381
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,399
ourselves because we are generally doing

382
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,880
a good job of keeping them in in um

383
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,560
pretty constant conditions um but in

384
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,320
these disease States is there something

385
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,880
we could do that can be informed by our

386
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,240
shared evolutionary history with all

387
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,360
these other mels um to approach this we

388
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,680
started thinking about what we might

389
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,040
learn from sort of really classical um

390
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,160
ecology experiments um and um this is

391
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,320
I'm sure um oh I've got a typo there I'm

392
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,360
sorry but um when you take a bunch of

393
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
species or a bunch of individuals and

394
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,440
you culture them under the same

395
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,600
conditions there's um as I'm sure many

396
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,800
of us have encountered before a common

397
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
Garden approach where you basically do

398
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,560
the same thing to everyone and see how

399
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,959
they differ and and figure out what are

400
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,360
the intrinsic responses um of those

401
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,839
species or individuals that allow them

402
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,120
to cope um in or that allow them to

403
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,480
produce different phenotypes in the same

404
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,720
environment um and we have been um able

405
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,519
to take this approach uh thanks in large

406
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,560
measure to some amazing resources at the

407
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,320
uh San Diego Zoo Global Frozen Zoo which

408
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,480
has stored dermal fiber blasts uh from

409
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,360
thousands of species and this is the key

410
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,160
part including multiple individuals per

411
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,880
species and and so um there's this

412
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,040
amazing room which I would wager to say

413
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,440
has more um viable genomic and genetic

414
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,959
diversity in it than anywhere in the

415
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,160
whole world and it looks kind of

416
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,880
unremarkable in in what it is it's this

417
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,680
is definitely not as exciting to visit

418
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,319
in the sense of oh my gosh I'm going to

419
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,839
observe animal behavior as a zooo but

420
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,040
there's a lot going on here um and we

421
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
think that this is especially exciting

422
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,519
for a number of reasons or has been

423
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,880
especially exciting to us for a number

424
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,360
of reasons um one of as I've as I've

425
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:07,319
indicated here is that rather than

426
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,600
having um one uh one sample so a cell

427
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,279
sample from one individual of each

428
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,920
species the zoo has had the forethought

429
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,920
over many many many decades now to

430
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,319
sample uh cells from multiple multiple

431
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,880
individuals per species and for anyone

432
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,759
who's ever designed any sort of

433
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,880
experiment of course know that this is

434
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,920
really essential because what we don't

435
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,920
want is we don't want to say hey look

436
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,759
this camel is doing this thing human is

437
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,000
not this is a camel thing we of course

438
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,959
want to know about intraspecific as well

439
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,360
as interspecific diversity and responses

440
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,480
and so we've been really fortunate that

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,600
there are many species mammals and

442
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,000
otherwise that for which the the Frozen

443
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,480
Zoo has stored cells from from multiple

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,040
individuals um I want to give you a

445
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,040
sense uh just starting here of of what

446
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,839
the what the set of species is that we

447
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,560
have um so as with any experiment this

448
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,160
was in part this list the composition of

449
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,959
this list was in part driven by we think

450
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,199
these are the the most exciting possible

451
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,160
study species and in part by the

452
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,600
practicalities of what's available and

453
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,120
what can be what can be cultured um we

454
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,919
have um as you'll see here um the dramer

455
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,240
camel um we also have the bacterian

456
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,959
camel which even though it resides in

457
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,000
much in much colder conditions uh seems

458
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,319
also to have the ability to let its

459
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
temperature vary a bit with the

460
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:31,400
environment um we have a bat and um the

461
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,240
squirrel as at least two hibernators um

462
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,919
we have um a couple species that we

463
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,440
think are really interesting in other

464
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,120
ways um so the the um the gelada for

465
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
example is a really high altitude

466
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,160
primate that lives under oxygen limited

467
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,880
conditions and I'll come in a second to

468
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,840
why we think that's important as well um

469
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,679
and the Egyptian fruit bat um survives

470
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,600
basically on a fruit and um a fruit diet

471
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,640
which would obviously not be a super

472
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,280
sustainable strategy glucose regulation

473
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,000
wise for a human and so we think it's

474
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,840
interesting in that way as well um this

475
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,120
uh list is um we have a there's been

476
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,039
some some variation this list but but um

477
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,120
we are happy that we have as many

478
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,000
species as we do and simultaneously

479
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,440
frustrated that we don't have more

480
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,559
because power statistical power is is

481
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,720
always a is always a challenge with any

482
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,400
project of this sort and so as I'll come

483
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,600
to a bit later in the talk um we are

484
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,520
currently um trying to figure out what

485
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,080
what we can do with the data as we have

486
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,600
them and what the limitations are given

487
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,000
power di yes um I might have missed this

488
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,039
but have you thought about introducing

489
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,480
our adding um evolutionary distance

490
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:44,159
among these species and making sure

491
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,159
you're covering lots of millions of

492
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,679
years of evolution that is a great

493
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:51,559
question um and there are two answers

494
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,559
that are sort of not really opposed one

495
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,919
of them is we've definitely thought and

496
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,080
maybe more accurately worried about it

497
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,919
and I'll come later to a more explicit

498
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,120
discussion of why we think that's really

499
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:07,520
important um we um we would love to

500
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,159
have the ideal scenario as I think your

501
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,240
question is alluding to is to have um

502
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,960
multiple species that have the same

503
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,480
types of resilience that are deeply

504
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,559
diverged from one another right like if

505
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,200
you want to know what makes you able to

506
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,159
cope with really variable temperature

507
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,400
conditions you want to be able to

508
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,679
disambiguate hey I'm a camel this is a

509
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,000
thing I do from hey look this is an

510
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,720
essential type of response for to in

511
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,600
order for a mammal to be able to cope

512
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,559
with with variable conditions um in an

513
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,960
Ideal World we would have much greater

514
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,559
coverage of that simply by virtue of

515
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,640
having more species um we did to The

516
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,200
Limited extent possible try to build

517
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,760
that into our design um with with

518
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,960
constraints that we are not super happy

519
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,159
about um so with with some specific

520
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,919
examples as I was saying we think that

521
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,360
the the camels are have some really

522
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,320
interesting thermal stuff going on but

523
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:05,320
they're close relatives um the the um

524
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,159
the oxygen limitation stuff that'll come

525
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,640
to in a second we have a little bit

526
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,200
better philogenetic spread basically

527
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,120
because the seal and the gelata are on

528
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,320
quite different branches of the tree and

529
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,520
both encounter that as part of their

530
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,360
their normal environment so um in in

531
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
summary we did think about it we haven't

532
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,880
coped with we haven't uh accommodated it

533
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,200
as comprehensively as we would like in

534
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,280
an ideally designed experiment but ask

535
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,400
me again in some number of years and I

536
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,440
hope they'll have a different

537
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,760
answer um and again just to to this kind

538
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,280
of was was the question you were

539
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,760
anticipating but it it turns out that um

540
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,360
for the species we've decided to include

541
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,760
um a number of them have U at least one

542
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,320
and and I and in some cases multiple

543
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,679
types of flexibility and so as I was

544
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,120
saying the the hibernators and both

545
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,640
camels seem to be uh thermally flexible

546
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,520
um the gelata and honey badger and an

547
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,440
edytion fruit fat all seem to have some

548
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,640
glucose flexibility um we've got two

549
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,919
diving mammals and then or three diving

550
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,320
mammals rather and then also the gelada

551
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,600
as as organisms that are um that are

552
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,520
tolerant of of hypoxia um and so

553
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,679
hopefully that to some degree gets at

554
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,000
this but and I say hopefully more

555
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,200
emphatically than I would have a couple

556
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,720
years ago I thought we could do more

557
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,039
with it than we can and so um we've kind

558
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,320
of switched from oh we're going to find

559
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,039
all the things to now we're going to try

560
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,679
to accommodate the limitations of our

561
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,880
data set do approve for principal and

562
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,520
hopefully convince someone to give us

563
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,320
more money to do truly all of the all of

564
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,600
the things great are there any other

565
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,559
questions or comments or suggestions

566
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,039
before I go

567
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:48,120
on cool

568
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:50,320
great um and just to to um to give us a

569
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,919
sense of what what we mean by by the

570
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,760
variable conditions I've been talking

571
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,320
mostly about temperature but we wanted

572
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,600
to do sort of a a truly comprehensive

573
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,080
framework and so in addition to

574
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,880
temperature flexibility

575
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,200
we considered glucose and oxygen

576
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,799
flexibility um the temperature

577
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,679
conditions are

578
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,520
um selected with constraint and again

579
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:11,960
this is another one of the kind of comes

580
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,360
back to your question Nicole about the

581
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,880
Practical versus ideal um aspects of of

582
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,360
experimental design so we decided to

583
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,679
choose as Baseline for all of our all of

584
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,039
our stressors the conditions that are

585
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,200
typical for culture of human cells in

586
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,720
the lab and so 37 being human body

587
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,640
temperature that's that's a um a

588
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,039
reasonable starting point we think for

589
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,600
the low temperature in an Ideal World we

590
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:38,200
actually would have been able to go

591
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,360
lower um because as I showed you before

592
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,880
hibernators get really really low and so

593
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,080
32 isn't just isn't that cold if you're

594
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,240
if you're um one of many species of

595
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,679
hibernators the downside is that we

596
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,080
wanted or the the constraint is that we

597
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,760
wanted to create a truly comprehensive

598
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,880
data set where we had data from every

599
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,559
individual of every species at every

600
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,240
condition and so um it turns out that if

601
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,120
gets too cold some of these cells just

602
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,480
don't grow and so um in this is another

603
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,000
thing that I think is sort of one of the

604
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,360
trade-offs between having a

605
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
comprehensive data set and having a

606
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,200
comprehensive set of species because we

607
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,440
can't have we can't figure out how some

608
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,000
cells do it much lower than 32 because

609
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,559
they just don't do anything because they

610
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,720
don't survive um and so that that was

611
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,039
one constraint um for glucose we tried

612
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,400
to model by our choice of conditions the

613
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,640
um the conditions that might be pretty

614
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,200
severe hypoxia sorry not hypoxia um um

615
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,679
low glucose and high glucose um that

616
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,880
might correspond to a hypoglycemic event

617
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,880
versus a hyperglycemic event and then um

618
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,799
for oxygen rather than exposing species

619
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,559
to high ACD in conditions we actually

620
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:53,320
decided to do short and long exposure to

621
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,760
hypoxia to sort of model what a short um

622
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,679
stint versus a long stint for a for

623
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,360
mamalian diver might be um again this is

624
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,760
a sort of a a less comprehensive set of

625
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,600
conditions and we would like really love

626
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,960
to have a have a more continuous

627
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,559
distribution of of States across or of

628
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,159
conditions across these these extremes

629
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:15,760
um but we started here um and then for

630
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,880
for uh data types we decided we wanted

631
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,880
to learn about um as many different

632
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,480
features of cellular response as

633
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,480
possible and so our our um collaborators

634
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,240
on this project who are focused on Cell

635
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,679
physiology have a bunch of different

636
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,960
ways I'll mention a couple of those in a

637
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,919
second to figure out how are the cells

638
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,320
doing under these conditions and so for

639
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,399
every every individual of every species

640
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,559
under every condition we asked some

641
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:41,720
basic things that we think are enabling

642
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:44,240
us to get at the question of cellular

643
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,520
health for lack of a better word um oops

644
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,080
we also asked about uh gene expression

645
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,600
um which is the analysis that we're

646
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,039
furthest along in but we have still

647
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,799
reached an impass with that and would be

648
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,760
grateful for your input we have some

649
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,640
chromatone accessibility data that we're

650
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,840
very much at the entry stages of of

651
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,360
analyzing

652
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,799
and that same goes for some cell

653
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,919
morphology data where we're trying to

654
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,360
figure out really basic but I think

655
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,279
potentially quite informative things

656
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,320
about how to cell shape change how does

657
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,279
metaconda shape and distribution

658
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,600
spatially change under these different

659
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:18,559
conditions um so again our collaborators

660
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,840
Ellison hindle and Carla metair um have

661
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,039
been focused on the cellular physiology

662
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,679
aspect of this project and we really for

663
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,840
the self physiology data started out

664
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,559
just by sort of doing a proof of

665
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,200
principle and so our prediction was that

666
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:38,399
um if if a species is um is flexible in

667
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,200
its temperature range tolerance then it

668
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:43,080
should be able to better cope with um

669
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,279
with variable temperatures in a way

670
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,399
that's observable at the cellular level

671
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,720
than one that like a human keeps things

672
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:52,679
really really um tightly controlled

673
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,600
internally and I was very anxious to get

674
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,679
the results of these experiments in part

675
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,919
because if it turned out that we didn't

676
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,960
see any variation between the strict and

677
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,919
flexible species here we'd kind of be in

678
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,640
a bad situation right the whole the

679
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,039
whole sort of premise of the project is

680
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,600
predicated on the idea that cellular

681
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:13,520
responses to variable conditions in some

682
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,520
way capture or recapitulate um

683
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,320
organismal phenotype and if we couldn't

684
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,679
observe that in culture we would have

685
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,399
been very sad so I am very relieved by

686
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,159
this graph and I think maybe the food is

687
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:27,360
arriving um so maybe maybe this is a

688
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,559
good time to to pause is that good so I

689
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
will I will leave you to think about

690
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,360
this for a second while you grab some

691
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,640
coffee and food and then finish up in

692
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,640
the next the next couple minutes so

693
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,120
great yes please

694
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,399
yeah uh so when infants have an initial

695
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,240
like hypoxia event around the time of

696
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:52,159
birth we actually cool their core

697
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,799
temperature to

698
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,679
32 um to actually prevent cellular

699
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,840
injury so after hypoxia the cool cooling

700
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,559
actually lowers metabolism enough to

701
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,720
prevent secondary cell death uh so I

702
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,520
just find that really interesting to

703
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,279
think about in the context that our

704
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,720
organ our again what you were saying

705
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,919
about cellular resilience versus

706
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,679
organismal resilience right yes that the

707
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:19,360
whole organism can be 32 degrees as a

708
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,480
human but that our cells can't be yeah

709
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,600
so I just found that interesting that is

710
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,520
really interesting and it also makes me

711
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,919
wonder about another thing we haven't

712
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,760
yet gotten to which is the combinatorial

713
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,960
thing so it sounds like the scenario

714
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,960
you're mentioning is sort of um the

715
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,880
effect of cooling in the context of

716
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,720
hypoxia and that maybe something that

717
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,519
this I mean not exactly misrepresents

718
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,000
but doesn't get at right because it's

719
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,320
only looking at Cooling in the absence

720
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,480
of hypoxia where there I'm sure there

721
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,159
are tradeoffs at all thank you for

722
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,760
mentioning that yeah but it also makes

723
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,240
me wonder right like many of these

724
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,320
animals that might have a shorter

725
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,159
lifespan might have less genetic

726
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,679
pressure for some later onset disorders

727
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:01,080
or things relative to those that would

728
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:06,080
prevent reproduction yeah so I wonder

729
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,880
if just how the kind of t uh life cycle

730
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,440
is integrated into the thoughts of like

731
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,240
what which genetic pressures would be

732
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,519
experienced by each species yeah that

733
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,880
that's a really good point um I think

734
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,960
that there the short answer is we don't

735
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,519
have enough data to include that as a

736
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,760
covariant as comprehensively as we' like

737
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:27,720
the slightly longer answer is that I

738
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,440
suspect that um if we did have a more

739
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,360
comprehens of species St we could start

740
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,799
to get at questions about whether the

741
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,559
stressors are routine or episodic so for

742
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,240
example if you're a hibernator you have

743
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,320
to be able to deal with cold every year

744
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,399
you're not going to make it to Spring um

745
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,679
whereas if you're a species that lives

746
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,120
in an environment where it's

747
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,720
occasionally really hot that would be

748
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,279
more of a selective sweep on occasion

749
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,960
than a constant pressure and I would

750
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,000
think that that would impose some really

751
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,720
different outcomes that you might be

752
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,159
able to parse apart if you had enough

753
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,440
species that are in those different

754
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,159
uh scenarios basically we cannot get at

755
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,480
that but I we've thought about that a

756
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:07,320
bit in terms of the hypoxia things and

757
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,080
that's why we've thought about the time

758
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,399
like the time of exposure but yes I

759
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,919
think it's a really good good question

760
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:15,360
that we can't yet address at all so and

761
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,760
then my last question which is like a

762
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,279
ninth grade biology question is it seems

763
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,440
like you're looking for episodes of

764
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,600
convergent evolution right where like

765
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,799
very different species have come to the

766
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,200
same like noal pathway as their solution

767
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,640
to a stressor what if you looked for

768
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,399
divergent evolution like two species

769
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,240
that because of a a change in ecosystem

770
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:37,760
specialization like no longer either one

771
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,640
continues to have the stressor and the

772
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,080
other one no longer does yes and if you

773
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,440
found multiple of those pairings that

774
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,039
could also show you what is shared and

775
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,399
change yes definitely um again more

776
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:52,159
species would be lovely for addressing

777
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,640
that um I think what perhaps you're

778
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,440
talking about is um in an aspect of what

779
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,000
you're alluding to is that there is the

780
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,559
potential for a relief of selective

781
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,320
pressure right and so um there are some

782
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,880
sort of parallel approaches there asking

783
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,640
for specific genes that have had

784
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,320
accelerated Evolution or um stronger

785
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,760
purifying selection for example that

786
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,080
might be more directly able to get at

787
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,640
the when did this happen and how over

788
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,200
what time scale is it continuing to

789
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,799
happen um again another set of amazing

790
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,720
questions that we have worried about and

791
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,600
not been able to address in this context

792
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,559
so yeah thank you so much thank

793
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,960
you so please everyone um feel free to

794
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:39,840
grab breakfast we really apologize for

795
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,720
the the lateness um Diane if I could ask

796
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,240
you a question that came from an

797
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,399
anonymous attendee online again about

798
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,640
more species um they say have you

799
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:52,159
considered extending your study to Aven

800
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,880
species to your examples their internal

801
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,840
temperatures Etc is a bit more

802
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,080
constrained than reptiles but not so

803
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,000
well as Mamon species it might give

804
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,240
clues about mechanisms conserved over

805
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,440
much longer evolutionary time scales can

806
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,039
you read that second part again I just

807
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,320
didn't hear one of the keywords oh uh I

808
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,279
think they were just asking about adding

809
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,360
um Aven and then gave some really

810
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,159
interesting biology about how that they

811
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,960
can constrain their temperatures a

812
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,320
little bit intermediate between reptiles

813
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,799
and mammals yes and which of course is

814
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,480
perhaps not surprising given the the

815
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,880
tree structure as well um as with my

816
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,440
maybe unifying answerers to the other

817
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,159
questions yes we have considered it no

818
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,880
we haven't gotten to it yet um but I

819
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,919
think there are some really interesting

820
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,440
things about birds certainly that um I I

821
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,440
might wildly guess that there are some

822
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,919
features about how birds respond that

823
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,320
will be shared with mammals and others

824
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,200
that maybe are unique having to do in

825
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,960
part with their evolutionary distance

826
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,320
and also with the um the extent to they

827
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,200
tightly control things so it's a

828
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,200
wonderful question and I have no answer

829
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,000
so so maybe I'll take like two more

830
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,080
minutes of pause three more minutes of

831
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,080
pause and then get back in

832
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,720
okay alert your pediatrician

833
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,559
I think I may throw that question to to

834
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,120
Sarah C can you ask it again I'm sorry

835
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,159
oh just because like if you have a kid

836
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,919
that's got a you know um infection of

837
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,600
some description and they they actually

838
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,600
can have temperatures of 104 but

839
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,360
pediatrition didn't get upset about that

840
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,080
you know yeah it's actually it's in some

841
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,279
ways it's the rate of rise or the change

842
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,960
in temperature that's more important for

843
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:57,279
things like s risk of febal seizures um

844
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,919
so you're right that you know uh that

845
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,360
the 10 for in and of itself is actually

846
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,880
makes it more likely to be viral which

847
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,200
is part of why people just don't have

848
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,960
therapies to offer other than

849
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,039
antipyretics but in terms of like

850
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,840
clinical complications of a very high

851
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:15,120
fever it's really like 106 or higher

852
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,320
where you start to get like cellular

853
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,279
damage uh but it's the the change in

854
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,399
temperature so either fast up or fast

855
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,000
off It's associated with seizures um so

856
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,559
those are the the things we worry about

857
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,440
we telling to be but the temperature is

858
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,600
104 yeah and right and they look

859
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,480
miserable right there's there's there's

860
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,240
uh organismal compromise but not

861
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,559
cellular compromise whereas there would

862
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,000
be for an adult at that temperature is

863
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,039
that right or is that just less commonly

864
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,639
a state attained by adults at all that's

865
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:45,320
a really good question I think of it as

866
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,919
being something that's more recoverable

867
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,600
as long as it's not sustained right like

868
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,600
I feel like humans very rarely really

869
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,760
sustain a temperature that high it's

870
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,600
usually on that order of hours yep um

871
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,440
but all this is all like phenomenologic

872
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,120
recollection from clinical training

873
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,320
might much more detailed information out

874
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,279
there yeah cool thank

875
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,760
you any other questions while the L

876
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:10,000
people get their breakfast yes first

877
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,320
first of all this is super interesting

878
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,399
like this comparative biology

879
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,280
perspective is really fascinating but I

880
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,440
was wondering just like um from a

881
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,200
different understanding because these

882
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,399
are all fi blasts like would you expect

883
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,639
something different with hepatocytes or

884
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,679
cardio myocytes or like for yeah it's a

885
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,240
really great question and I think you're

886
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,359
probably detecting a theme here which is

887
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,119
that I have a

888
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,079
ideal idealized response and a pragmatic

889
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,359
response and I'll start with the

890
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,480
idealized response which is that in a

891
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:38,839
way it might be nice to be able to or

892
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,679
especially nice to be able to get at

893
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:43,839
some cell that is not so directly

894
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,560
exposed to the environment that it is

895
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,480
you know closer to what the whole

896
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,119
organism and the organism's internal

897
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,280
features are experiencing under these

898
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,359
conditions um so I would love to be able

899
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,839
to do exactly the same experiments in

900
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,919
parallel with one of these other things

901
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,079
because in addition to it there being an

902
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:00,520
argument that would be better cell type

903
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,000
whatever it also would be really

904
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,720
interesting to compare to see whether

905
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,440
this is is this a camel thing or is this

906
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,200
a camel cell exposed to the out external

907
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,880
conditions thing um so my response there

908
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,920
is yes definitely um my my response

909
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,280
about dermal fiber blasts um in the

910
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,480
pragmatic sense is that uh one of the

911
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,720
things that I really appreciate among

912
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,720
many about the this uh San Diego frozen

913
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,720
zoo is that they are have been dedicated

914
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,640
to minimally invasive sampling and so

915
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,599
all of these cells were collected in the

916
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,880
context of routine vet erary care um and

917
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,560
so you know to collect from an internal

918
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,160
tissue would definitely require invasive

919
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,520
and maybe immediately postmortem

920
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,520
collection um but the reason at the

921
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,359
moment at least that cells are available

922
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,200
from such a great number and diversity

923
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,880
of species is that this is an accessible

924
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,480
cell type there's also I think the

925
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,040
argument that dermal fibr blasts being

926
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,640
outside basically are going to be more

927
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,680
exposed to the environment and so we

928
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,480
might expect that they um they are are

929
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,920
typically experiencing these

930
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,480
fluctuations more directly and so we

931
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,359
think hand baby we we think that maybe

932
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,839
we would have greater opportunity to

933
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,599
observe some of these things and so it

934
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:13,720
felt to us like a reasonable order of

935
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,319
operations to start with the cell type

936
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,000
likely to yield the greatest effects and

937
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:18,079
then move later to exactly the ones

938
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,240
you're mentioning when those things

939
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,720
become available um but I would love to

940
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,000
know how many of these things are cell

941
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,000
type specific versus species intrinsic

942
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,720
things and I do not know won't know for

943
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,400
a while I think thank you that's a

944
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,760
really good

945
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,640
question um that sounds great it sounds

946
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,760
like most people have their lunch and

947
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,880
maybe we can wrap up in the next 15

948
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,560
minutes do you think you could finish by

949
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,280
25 great yeah I think I was I was aiming

950
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,160
for 920 so I think we're good yeah thank

951
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,480
you so I've had this slide up here for a

952
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,800
while um basically I just wanted to make

953
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,920
the point that oxygen consumption rate

954
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,280
um our our collaborators who work on

955
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,200
cellular physiology use that as a metric

956
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,599
of how the cells are doing under a given

957
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,160
set of conditions because it is a

958
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,920
reflection mitochondrial respiration

959
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,359
rate um and we were encouraged although

960
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,200
the data are very noisy um to find that

961
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,680
in many cases the and not all obviously

962
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,040
but in many cases the strict species

963
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,200
have more of a change between their

964
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,119
oxygen consumption rate at Baseline

965
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,560
which here is represented here is

966
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,319
represented as the zero so that's no

967
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,440
change from 37 um when you expose them

968
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:27,960
either the 32 or 41 than do the flexible

969
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,200
species um and so each each of the

970
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,800
symbols here is an individual within

971
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,200
that um within that species and so this

972
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,200
comes to why we thought it was important

973
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,720
to have samples for multiple individuals

974
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,920
per species because they can attempt

975
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,480
with the limitations of n to sort of

976
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,079
disentangle a species feature from a an

977
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,480
anomalous feature of a particular

978
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,119
individual um obviously there are some

979
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
exceptions here and we would love to

980
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,680
have more individuals to know what to

981
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,520
make of them but U for example humans uh

982
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,839
don't seem to respond as badly to 32 and

983
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,560
maybe this comes to what Sarah was

984
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,640
mentioning earlier about the potentially

985
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,599
beneficial therapeutic effects of that

986
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,400
um uh but we we just don't know but

987
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,200
anyway as an initial pass we were in

988
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,599
infused to see that the strict species

989
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,440
uh seem to respond with greater change

990
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,599
in oxygen consumption rate to Thermal

991
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,200
perturbation than do the flexible

992
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,560
species uh one other point I wanted to

993
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,280
make is that as I mentioned earlier uh

994
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,599
the camel and the squirrel even though

995
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,880
they're both okay it seems at organal

996
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,280
level with with temperature variation

997
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,920
they're okay with temperature variation

998
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,000
in different directions in their normal

999
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,720
lives and so the camel typically gets

1000
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,760
really hot or comparatively warm uh the

1001
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,880
squirrel gets cool during hibernation

1002
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,880
and yet both of those species are okay

1003
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,400
it seems for oxygen consumption rate

1004
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,000
both at 32 and at 41 and so one of the

1005
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,920
emerging themes that I wouldn't go so

1006
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,359
far as to say is a pattern yet but we

1007
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,520
are intrigued by is the possibility that

1008
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,760
there are some components of thermal

1009
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,119
tolerance that are non-directional

1010
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,720
meaning that maybe there are some things

1011
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,760
you evolve that allow you to deal with

1012
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,920
um temperature perturbation that are not

1013
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,160
specific to getting warm or getting cool

1014
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,839
but just are are are um about being able

1015
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,240
to deal with with greater temperature

1016
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,440
variation um another aspect of the data

1017
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,560
that is very much in its infancy but um

1018
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,480
as I was mentioning earlier um our

1019
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,960
colleagues who work on Cell

1020
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,440
physiology are um are uh also taking um

1021
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,680
using microscopy to examine cellular

1022
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,760
impacts at various temperatures um the

1023
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,319
White Rhino as you'll recall from from

1024
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,760
this previous slide is one of the

1025
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:39,040
species that seem is a strict therm

1026
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,960
regulator we think um and seems to do

1027
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,400
especially badly under both um hot and

1028
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,040
cold conditions so it has these

1029
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,079
significant changes in its oxygen

1030
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,720
consumption rate um and we also noticed

1031
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,400
and again these data are very

1032
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,359
preliminary I'm sorry that there isn't a

1033
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,160
species to compare them to just yet but

1034
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,000
it seems that the Rhino cells have a lot

1035
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,280
of changes in cells morphology um when

1036
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,280
you either cool or sorry in this case

1037
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,520
when you warm them um and so we're

1038
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,680
interested in asking as the data begin

1039
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,760
to emerge which they are doing now um

1040
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,440
whether this is a general property of

1041
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,800
for example species that have apparent

1042
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
changes in oxygen consumption rate under

1043
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,839
thermal

1044
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,560
perturbation um I want to end with

1045
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,440
talking a little bit about what we've

1046
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,720
done so far with the the RNA sequencing

1047
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,280
data um and what we think is a major

1048
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,200
constraint right now and what we can do

1049
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,200
with those data and ideally ask for your

1050
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,440
help in in in in coping with that

1051
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,200
problem so when I first started thinking

1052
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,440
about this project in this problem I was

1053
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,920
like oh this is great we're going to

1054
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,800
take all these species expose them to

1055
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,440
these conditions we'll find things that

1056
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,240
everyone does and that just the strict

1057
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,960
or or flexible uh species do when

1058
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,079
they're exposed to Thermal perturbation

1059
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,760
for example um as Nicole was alluding to

1060
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,480
already there's a big problem with that

1061
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
because we don't just want to know hey

1062
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,640
what do strict species do or what do

1063
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,119
flexible species do that strict don't we

1064
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,440
really want to know are there things

1065
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,160
that are surprising given the philogyny

1066
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,040
and so I had not thought adequately

1067
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,960
about that constraint before we started

1068
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,280
this and so right now we are able to say

1069
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,520
things like um there are Universal

1070
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,200
responses among all study species and by

1071
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,720
this I mean if you crank up the

1072
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,599
temperature to 41 there are certain

1073
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,960
Pathways that are enriched among the

1074
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,920
genes that have a significant P change

1075
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,520
when you use all five of those uh

1076
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,440
individuals per species um that every

1077
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,000
single individual does and so some of

1078
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,240
those have to do with cholesterol bio

1079
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,839
biosynthesis some cell membrane stuff

1080
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,760
there maybe not totally surprising in

1081
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,880
light of of light of um a response to

1082
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,720
higher temperature um there are some

1083
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,800
things having to do with protein folding

1084
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,599
again not surprising given some of the

1085
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,040
the things about protein detrition um so

1086
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,640
that was all good these are things we

1087
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,520
can say everyone that we've studied so

1088
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,560
far does um we can also start to say

1089
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,160
things about what our star um flexible

1090
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,000
high temperatures species the Dromedary

1091
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,079
camel does in terms of uh regulating

1092
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,720
Pathways or up or changing the

1093
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,680
expression of genes in Pathways that

1094
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,760
other species don't do or other um that

1095
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,280
strict species don't do and those have

1096
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,119
to do with cell cycle proliferation

1097
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,599
protein homeostasis DNA repair

1098
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,680
production against oxidative stress and

1099
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,400
homeostasis of mitochondrial metabolism

1100
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,280
this is maybe not surprising these are

1101
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,520
all things that might go badly when it's

1102
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,440
when it's high temperature um I was

1103
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,240
initially really excited about this but

1104
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,079
then I started worrying that um this is

1105
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,599
just again still very descriptive right

1106
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,359
we can say that these are things that

1107
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:39,800
Camel does but we can't really say

1108
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,040
whether they are um whether they are

1109
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,359
well we can say that in our study

1110
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,920
species we're unique we can't say that

1111
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:46,960
they're universally unique and that

1112
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,440
things get even worse when we think

1113
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,599
about the constraints of our tree um

1114
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,480
when we think about trying to find trait

1115
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,880
relevant convergent changes in gene

1116
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,200
expression which we really think is a

1117
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,000
complex Challenge and asteris there um

1118
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,240
is to highlight that this is one we have

1119
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,040
yet to solve and um I've been talking

1120
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,559
with a bunch of people who work on U

1121
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,720
philogynes and and um evolution of

1122
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:09,680
traits and it I um have been really

1123
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,559
struck that we're kind of maybe as a

1124
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,839
field converging on this as an open

1125
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:16,200
question that doesn't yet have a really

1126
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,280
satisfying and statistically appealing

1127
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,079
answer um so I just want to take us

1128
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,440
through this example and again this

1129
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,559
comes back to something that Nicole was

1130
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,400
mentioning a couple minutes ago so say

1131
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,440
that we observe um that um that these

1132
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,559
that our two camel species both of which

1133
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,000
as far as we know are thermally flexible

1134
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:36,359
have some Gene that is either up or down

1135
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,880
regulated significantly in response to

1136
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,160
temperature I personally would find that

1137
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,559
exciting we can say this is the thing

1138
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:44,400
that camels do when it's really hot um

1139
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,240
but there is a problem in that this also

1140
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,800
maybe isn't totally surprising because

1141
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,440
those camels are closely related to one

1142
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,280
another and so those aren't really

1143
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,000
independent observations they're a thing

1144
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,839
we know about what camels do but we

1145
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,640
can't say that this has evolved

1146
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:57,839
independently or this is a response that

1147
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,079
is sort of

1148
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:06,040
universally U present among among

1149
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:08,599
species that can tolerate high heat um

1150
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,000
um at least in the relative sense I

1151
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:13,240
would be more excited if we were to find

1152
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,280
some um some Gene whose expression

1153
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,640
changed significantly not just in the

1154
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,440
camels but also in the hibernators um

1155
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,319
for two reasons one of them is that

1156
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,839
camels are Heap tolerant hibernators

1157
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:25,079
seem to be more tolerant of lower

1158
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:27,359
temperatures and there's a much greater

1159
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,920
Branch length between our camels and are

1160
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,800
hibernators and so that would leave me

1161
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,800
comparatively confident also very

1162
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,599
handwavy um that this is a a sort of a

1163
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,200
convergent trait that exists

1164
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,640
independently on these lineages and

1165
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,160
isn't just sort of a byproduct if you

1166
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,359
will of their their recent evolutionary

1167
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,559
relationship um so I um my colleague

1168
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:50,280
Lucas morrera and I have been scaring

1169
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,000
the literature to try to find about

1170
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,079
whether there are ways to that exist

1171
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,079
already to try to understand and put key

1172
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,680
values on basic basically a a sharing of

1173
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:05,480
responses across species with a given

1174
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:08,880
phenotype um that is impressive given

1175
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,240
their given their philogyny and so um

1176
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,680
one of the methods that has begun to get

1177
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,119
at some of this is the eve method um

1178
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,880
which um the expression variance and

1179
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,440
evolution model by rals um and

1180
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,520
introduced by rals and then elaborated

1181
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,640
more recently in a bunch of other papers

1182
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,520
that basically assumes that um Gene

1183
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,800
regulation as shown here on on the left

1184
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,280
evolves randomly across a tree and so

1185
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,760
the intuition here is that if a branch

1186
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,400
length between two species is longer

1187
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,880
then you'd expect them to be more

1188
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,960
diverged than than um than the branch

1189
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,800
length in in expression change might be

1190
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,960
between two closely related species and

1191
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,640
this is like a classic random walk and

1192
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,160
so the idea here is that um you just

1193
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,960
simulate along the tree and what you're

1194
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,520
looking for um is cases where a the

1195
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,680
expression change on a given branch is

1196
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,839
excess given the length of that branch

1197
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,400
which would suggest yep there's

1198
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,880
something really really meaningful going

1199
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,720
on here in terms of the change in

1200
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,760
expression um the this model is also

1201
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,400
able to look at a bunch of different

1202
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,599
species and their full change in

1203
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,599
response to something and ask about

1204
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,480
whether there are there's evidence that

1205
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,480
there are two different optimal levels

1206
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,040
of expression and so this is they call

1207
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,960
this the Theta test and so basically you

1208
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,960
can ask are there you know is there

1209
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,960
evidence that there are um that maybe

1210
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,760
High expression is selected one lineage

1211
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,319
and low expression is Select CED another

1212
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,720
lineage um this was really exciting to

1213
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,200
us at first and indeed it's an awesome

1214
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,240
method it's super cool um the problem is

1215
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,400
that there is not yet as far as we can

1216
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,160
tell a way to specifically look for

1217
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,319
cases of convergence um and by this I

1218
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,079
mean um cases where you again like in as

1219
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,680
you might um think about in this example

1220
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:50,440
are there things where in spite of the

1221
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,079
Long Branch link comparatively between

1222
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,839
the squirrel and the and the camels

1223
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,480
there are things that are more similar

1224
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,480
in their in their expression change than

1225
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:01,480
you'd expect given that line given that

1226
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,800
uh Branch link and so I will just stop

1227
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,760
by saying um we've been running um Eve

1228
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,920
um which again we think is an exciting

1229
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,280
start but it leads us kind of with this

1230
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,040
problem and so um we'll see that there

1231
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,040
are um that there is evidence for

1232
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:21,000
example for this Gene which I I'm just

1233
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,319
using as an example for two different um

1234
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,960
Optimum expression levels that is there

1235
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:27,440
are significant differences in the

1236
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,720
expression of this Gene for some

1237
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,280
lineages as compared to the other

1238
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,920
however what we can't do is to say that

1239
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,920
the flexible species so here the the

1240
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,720
squirrel the bat and the two camels are

1241
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,559
more similar than you'd expect given

1242
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,200
their given their Branch length and so

1243
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:46,960
we've been trying to figure out are

1244
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,040
there Ford simulation ways to get at

1245
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,119
this um are there other things that we

1246
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,319
haven't thought about um in talking with

1247
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,760
a bunch of people as I was saying

1248
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,160
recently about sort of a philogenetic

1249
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,000
approach to this this seems like a

1250
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,920
problem that the field is converging on

1251
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,319
in terms of no pun intended but the the

1252
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,760
field is converging on in terms of

1253
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,760
looking for genes whose um whose

1254
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,440
expression is more similar between

1255
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,960
diverg lineages that you can annotate AR

1256
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,280
priori than you'd expect um I don't know

1257
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,280
what to do with this um I will close on

1258
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,720
the unsatisfying Note um of saying that

1259
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,880
we are still perplexed by this and um

1260
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,319
for me it's kind of a a sad note in in

1261
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,240
what I think is otherwise a promising

1262
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,760
project where we can right now say hey

1263
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,359
look these genes change in these species

1264
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,280
but I cannot tell you

1265
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,720
whether that is surprising given their

1266
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,079
philogyny and I hope that not too long

1267
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,520
from now we collectively will come to an

1268
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,559
answer and I will be able to give you

1269
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,960
some greater certainty on that um and

1270
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,960
then let's see um so finally this kind

1271
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,520
of comes to what I was just saying a

1272
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,599
second ago but we want to identify

1273
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,040
convergent changes in gene expression

1274
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,599
convergent changes in chromatin

1275
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,839
accessibility and then in some work I

1276
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,440
haven't had a chance to talk about today

1277
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:57,240
um convergent changes in RNA splicing in

1278
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,000
the response to to temperature and other

1279
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,799
changes and what we really want to do I

1280
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,359
think is develop methods to get at these

1281
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:05,880
things um so with that and I think my

1282
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,799
timing is okay unsurprisingly given the

1283
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,480
diversity of data types that we that

1284
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:10,880
have gone into this project we have a

1285
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,480
whole bunch of collaborators working on

1286
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,280
a whole bunch of things um so Lucas who

1287
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,559
is um up here on the left who was um at

1288
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,960
brood and is now at Colossal has done

1289
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,760
all of the RNA expression work and has

1290
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,799
um been trying to see whether there's a

1291
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,720
way we can push the eve model to get at

1292
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:30,680
this question of convergence um Carla

1293
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,799
and Allison here have been doing all of

1294
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,880
the cell culture work without which none

1295
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:37,559
of this would be possible um Eleanor and

1296
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,640
Lucas and I have been focused on the

1297
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,880
genomics um uh Jorge and chrisy and

1298
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,319
Valerie have been working on some

1299
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,520
mathematical modeling to try to get at

1300
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:49,040
the question of genomic drivers of these

1301
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,880
responses Daniel is starting to work on

1302
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,079
the chromatin accessibility data and

1303
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,079
then I also wanted to give a shout out

1304
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:56,400
to the uh bird summer Scholars Program

1305
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,880
through which we had the opportunity to

1306
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,520
work with two high school students this

1307
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,960
summer who really started doing some um

1308
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,960
RNA spacing work with our data that um

1309
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,640
this was news to me but we just had RNA

1310
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,480
expression data and with those and

1311
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,920
combination with a with a um a spacing

1312
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,079
program called our mats we were able to

1313
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,760
infer um instances of differential

1314
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:18,920
spacing and we think that there may be a

1315
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,400
lot of instances of differential spacing

1316
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,599
thanks to Jordan and Erica's work sorry

1317
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,160
Georgia and Eric's work um there may be

1318
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,160
many cases of differential splicing that

1319
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,760
are also responses to heat that we would

1320
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,599
miss if we were just asking about

1321
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,480
changes and expression I will end there

1322
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,160
and say I'm sorry that I didn't have

1323
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,720
more conclusive things to say but this

1324
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,440
is where we are in this project and I

1325
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,760
hope we will be further along and not

1326
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:45,240
too long and I would be grateful for any

1327
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,240
questions and suggestions so
