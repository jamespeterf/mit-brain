1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,680
All right. Well, we have two more

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,359
classes and this is uh day two of trying

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,760
to grapple with the recent big

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,920
breakthrough in projection theory. So,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,240
this is sharp projection theorems part

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,599
two. And in part two we're going to talk

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,120
about the ad regular case. So let's

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,320
first remember our goal and remember

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,320
what is the ad regular case.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,399
Okay.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,320
So our goal is the first set conjecture

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:52,640
which is a theorem of Orpin and Schmurk

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:57,520
and Ren and W says if E contained in R2

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,199
is a delta T C set

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,080
and then for every point in E there are

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:11,360
a bunch of delta tubes going through it.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:14,240
So t subx is a set of delta tubes

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,439
through x

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,400
and the the directions if you like of

20
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:25,400
this set of delta tubes is a delta s c

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
set.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay. And parenthetically we can assume

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,479
a couple of things. uh we can assume

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,040
that this is uh is uniform

25
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,240
and also that the number of them it's

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,320
like delta to the minus s and s should

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,920
be bigger than zero.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,360
Okay, so we put all of these tubes

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,360
together to get one big set of tubes

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
and the question is how many tubes are

31
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,880
there?

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,320
Um so then the conclusion is

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,960
that the number of tubes is at least a

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,960
little fudge factor.

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,840
So this whole thing I'll abbreviate like

36
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,840
that and then the minimum of a few

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,840
options

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,599
which we'll call option A, option B and

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,599
option C.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
Okay. And these exponents are hard to

41
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,599
remember, but I would prefer to remember

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000
for everyone to think of them in terms

43
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,440
of three different scenarios.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
So option A that corresponds to the I

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
call it the stars scenario. Have a bunch

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,720
of points and through each you have a

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
bunch of tubes and they're just

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,959
unrelated to each other.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Option B is more intricate. It's the

50
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,319
integer grid scenario.

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,519
Um and option C is a kind of random

52
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,519
scenario. So E is arbitrary

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,360
and T is random.

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,159
Okay. Um

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,720
now it's it's really a good idea to

56
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,640
think about this theorem in these three

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,400
different scenarios. So it's good to

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
separate out the case where each one of

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
those things is the minimum. Um, so let

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,440
me do that and recall for you how much

61
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,440
we know about each case so far.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,120
Um, and I said something about this last

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
time, but what I said wasn't uh the best

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799
thing to say. So I wanted to do it again

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,640
and get it right.

66
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,080
All right. So there's the case where a

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,560
is the minimum option. And if you do a

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,599
little algebra that corresponds to s

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,519
being at least as big as t.

70
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,120
Um and in this case

71
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,280
so if s is at least as big as t then the

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,480
uh the theorem is is true the first so

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,480
first is is true

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,799
and it follows just by double counting.

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,440
So we did it very early in the course

76
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,479
like on the second one.

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,280
Okay. Then I'll come back to B which is

78
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,680
the most interesting. C is the minimal.

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,120
If you do a little algebra it's if S

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,880
plus T is at least two.

81
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,160
Um and in this whole range where S plus

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,479
T is at least two the theorem is is also

83
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,560
true true and it's true by the forier

84
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,160
method. So it follows from the theorem

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
we proved in the second or third week

86
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,759
using for a analysis. So the whole case

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,919
where C is minimal uh we we also already

88
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,479
understand that

89
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,400
okay and that leaves a case where B is

90
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,160
minimal and that's like otherwise if

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,600
neither of these things are true then B

92
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,440
is minimal and um and so that's that's

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,240
the content of this theorem. So this is

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,240
the hard new thing

95
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,759
in the uh OSRW thing.

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Okay,

97
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,520
cool.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,440
Another little comment is that the the

99
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,320
number of tubes is not my favorite

100
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,880
parameter to keep track of. Um, my

101
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,759
favorite parameter to keep track of is

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,770
I'll call it R

103
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
of of ET,

104
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,080
[Applause]

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,039
which in words is like the typical

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,080
number

107
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:04,919
of delta balls

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,919
of E on a typical tube of T.

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,759
Um so let's make a uh

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,639
let's make a picture. Um so we have some

111
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,600
delta balls and then we have some delta

112
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
tubes going through them

113
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,600
and in in an interesting scenario each

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:32,160
tube will have many balls in it and r is

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,560
this number of balls in a tube. Okay.

116
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,880
So algebraically

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,440
by double counting

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,319
number of balls in a tube would be the

119
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,919
number of points times the number of

120
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,240
tubes going through a point divided by

121
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,440
uh the number of tubes. So that would be

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,000
the algebraic definition of r. And then

123
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,800
it's easy to convert bounds for t into

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,280
bounds for r. So our theorem is

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,280
equivalent to

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,919
um that r is upper bounded by the

127
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,840
maximum of three things. Scenario one is

128
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,720
a. So scenario one the number of balls

129
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,319
per tube is one which is always easy to

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
arrange.

131
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,759
Uh b you have to do a little

132
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,280
computation. It works out to this.

133
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
I don't really care what the exponent.

134
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not important what the exponents

135
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:36,720
are. And C is delta to the uh t + one.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,400
Okay. And this delta to the t + one has

137
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
a nice interpretation which might

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,599
clarify a little bit what we mean by

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:49,840
this random case. So if um e is a set is

140
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:53,440
a delta tc set. So the size of e is

141
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,319
delta to the minus t. Uh let me say it

142
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,120
this way. Suppose that E

143
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,280
is a set of delta to the minus T delta

144
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:07,599
balls in the unit ball.

145
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:12,720
And then I take the average over any

146
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:14,400
choice of delta by one rectangles of um

147
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,240
the number of delta balls that the

148
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,599
rectangle covers. You would get delta to

149
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,680
the minus t + 1.

150
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,960
So it's not difficult to locate

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,759
rectangles with that richness. Almost

152
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,240
any rectangle would do the job. And

153
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
scenario C is when the rectangles just

154
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,039
have this average richness. There's

155
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,039
really nothing special about them.

156
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,440
Okay. So next let's remember. So their

157
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
goal today is to talk about the ad

158
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,880
regular case. So let's remember what

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,880
what is the ad regular case.

160
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,399
Okay. So we're going to suppose

161
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:18,000
that E is uniform.

162
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,240
So that means that our delta is some um

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,480
capital delta to the m where m is a

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,480
large number

165
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,800
and the uniformity is that if I take e

166
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,320
and I intersect it with a cube of side

167
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,760
length delta to the j and I ask about

168
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:41,600
its delta to the j + one covering number

169
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:45,360
that's around some uh beta j

170
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:52,120
for all the iatic

171
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,120
Q delta J um that intersect E.

172
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,959
Okay, so these beta J are the branching

173
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,720
numbers. We drew pictures last time to

174
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:08,959
illustrate what they mean. Um and so

175
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,920
definition would be that E is C L4 is to

176
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:18,000
be regular. So actually let's say it's a

177
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:21,200
delta t c a d regular set

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,880
f um has a this branching structure like

179
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:30,640
above and um if I take the product j = 1

180
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,000
to capital j of beta j. So that would be

181
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,720
the delta j covering number delta to the

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
j covering number of our set.

183
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,279
um

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:47,519
it is at most C * delta to the J to the

185
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:52,120
minus T and it is at least 1 / C * delta

186
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,120
to the J to the minus T.

187
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Okay.

188
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,160
All right.

189
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,279
So, let's label all these hypotheses in

190
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,279
our theorem by each our hypothesis.

191
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,920
And what we'd like to understand is

192
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,240
given these hypotheses, how big could R

193
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,000
be?

194
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
And for for today we're going to talk

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,839
about the AD regular case. So let's give

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:42,240
that a name. So R A D of S T delta C

197
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,880
that is the maximum

198
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:50,560
over E and T obey our hypothesis

199
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,720
and E is a

200
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:58,959
delta T C a d regular

201
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:02,320
of R of E and T. How big could it be in

202
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,920
in this case?

203
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,200
Okay, there's really a mouthful of

204
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,880
parameters. So, let me just say to uh

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,240
reduce a little bit for today, we'll

206
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,320
have C equals 1. Um so, that means it's

207
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,880
you know really ad regular and

208
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,959
everything we say actually um will work

209
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,959
for small C that are bigger than

210
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,560
that will allow us to not write the

211
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,920
letter C. And then s and t will not be

212
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,240
changing through our arguments. So I

213
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,279
won't write them every time. So now I'll

214
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,519
just abbreviate it

215
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,519
as r a d of dot.

216
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Okay.

217
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,279
All right. So um

218
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,279
so the theorem that orbit and smirkin

219
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:01,279
proved is that they they proved this

220
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:04,399
thing in the ad case. So r a d s delta

221
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,399
is indeed bounded by

222
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,399
that.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm not sure I computed right.

224
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,480
Got the minus signs wrong.

225
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
So that's our goal for today is to

226
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
understand this theorem which is a

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,920
really important special case of that

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,920
theorem.

229
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,639
Cool.

230
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,240
So maybe so it's clearly a special case

231
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,839
of that theorem. Um and at first it

232
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,200
might seem like a very special case

233
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
because these branching function

234
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,120
basically there's a huge range of what

235
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,959
the branching function could be and ad

236
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,279
regular is just one particular choice in

237
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,360
this huge range but it's a particularly

238
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,839
important case and we'll see tomorrow or

239
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,320
next class that that this is really a

240
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,079
crucial case plays a big role in

241
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,079
understanding the theorem in general.

242
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,079
Okay,

243
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,639
cool. Um, yeah. So, so it was a really

244
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,079
it was a really important realization in

245
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,760
thinking about this theorem that we

246
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,360
should break it into cases. The

247
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,959
different cases have their different

248
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,440
things that are useful and their

249
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,480
different things that are difficult um

250
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,320
and um and and so that recognition is is

251
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
key. So the next thing I want to try to

252
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,760
talk about is like what is special about

253
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,320
ad regular sets that we could use to to

254
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,079
get a handle on them um that we couldn't

255
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:51,079
use just for the for the general setup.

256
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,079
All right.

257
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,320
Okay. So this proof is is quite

258
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
difficult. We won't do all of it, but I

259
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,519
would like to share some key ideas about

260
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,160
it which I think are really cool and and

261
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,959
are like sort of worth taking with you

262
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,040
away from this class.

263
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,040
All right.

264
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,760
Okay, so in a nutshell, the important

265
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:52,160
special thing about ad regular sets is

266
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,880
in this lema that has a one board proof

267
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,880
which is called the sub multiplicative

268
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
lema.

269
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:08,160
Okay, so it says that RA a delta, let me

270
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:13,199
put it this way. If delta is delta 1 *

271
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:17,040
delta 2, then RA a delta is bounded by

272
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,959
with a little bit of fudge RA a delta 1

273
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,440
time ra

274
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,440
delta 2.

275
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
It is sub multiplicative.

276
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,759
Okay.

277
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,279
and

278
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,000
it follows from understanding thinking a

279
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,399
lot about a picture of an ad regular

280
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,120
set.

281
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:45,680
Okay. So

282
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:49,279
remember that E is a set of delta balls

283
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,040
and T is a set of delta tubes and we're

284
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:56,000
going to imagine thickening them.

285
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,000
So, so in this setup here, um, delta is

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,040
smaller than delta 1 and delta 2, which

287
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,800
are smaller than one. So, delta 1 and

288
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,760
delta 2 are each bigger than delta. So,

289
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm going to thicken them, and I'll get

290
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,439
E1,

291
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,160
I'll call it, which are the delta 1

292
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:17,480
balls around E, and T1, which are delta

293
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,480
1 tools.

294
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,199
All right. So, what does it look like?

295
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,199
Let's think about E and thickening E.

296
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,600
So here is E1 is this bunch of circles.

297
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,080
Each circle has radius delta 1

298
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,720
and inside of those circles there are

299
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,720
some delta balls

300
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,919
and those guys are my delta balls E.

301
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Okay. Now,

302
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:11,160
um, T1 are some delta 1 tubes.

303
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,160
So, they might look sort of like this.

304
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,559
Let's put one more ball up here.

305
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,120
That looks like that. So, those are my

306
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
fat tubes. T1

307
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,280
Um and then there are inside of them

308
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,280
there are some delta tubes T2

309
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
that um

310
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,320
there are too many but I'll try to give

311
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,280
some idea. So,

312
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,000
so through this point here,

313
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,000
there might be a couple of red tubes

314
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,640
that are inside of that orange tube. And

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
then there might be a couple of red

316
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,400
tubes

317
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,400
that are inside of that orange tube.

318
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Okay? And I just drew the ones through

319
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,039
this point. Experience has taught me

320
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,200
that if I draw more, this picture will

321
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,480
get too messy. But you should imagine

322
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,480
that this is happening at every point.

323
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,520
Okay.

324
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,520
So

325
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:39,720
first observation is that E1 and T1 obey

326
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,720
the hypothesis of our theorem

327
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,919
because actually if so if you take a

328
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,760
delta t set of balls and you thicken

329
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,799
them up to radius delta 1, you get a

330
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,840
delta onet set of balls

331
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,080
at least if because if it's uniform

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,840
and um if you Look at who's going

333
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,039
through this point. Uh we have a delta s

334
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,120
set of directions leaving that point.

335
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,760
And if you thicken them up a little bit,

336
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,919
you get um the directions corresponding

337
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,559
to the orange tubes. And that will be a

338
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,559
delta 1 s set of directions.

339
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:21,559
Okay,

340
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,559
great. Um then

341
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
yeah. Okay, so

342
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
let let me put the punch line and then

343
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,200
we'll think through why this works.

344
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,240
So R A D of delta that's the number of

345
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:41,360
white balls in a red tube, but that's

346
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:45,480
bounded by the number of delta 1 balls

347
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,480
in a delta 1 tube.

348
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,840
Right? So I look in this orange tube, I

349
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,400
see how many of these balls there are

350
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,520
times

351
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,480
the number of delta balls

352
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:06,520
in a delta tube within

353
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,520
one delta 1 bar.

354
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
So if I'm looking at this at this red

355
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,559
tube here, I want to know how many delta

356
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,640
balls are in it. It's bounded by the

357
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,840
number of big balls that it enters

358
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,320
times the number of little balls in each

359
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,320
of the big balls.

360
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,679
Okay. So, we'd like to relate these two

361
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,200
things to our problem at a coarser

362
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,360
scale.

363
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,960
And this one here well E1 and T1 obey

364
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:52,440
our hypothesis. So this this one here is

365
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,440
bounded by RA a D of delta 1.

366
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,360
Now here

367
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:01,520
if you take E and T and you restrict

368
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,840
them

369
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,840
to a delta 1 ball

370
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,440
and then you magnify it to bring it up

371
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,080
to scale one. Um this also obeys our

372
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,679
hypothesis.

373
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,919
So if you look inside of here, you see a

374
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,799
little delta TC sat a little a little uh

375
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,120
you know this this this

376
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,159
and and these red tubes. That's the same

377
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,159
situation on a smaller scale or on a

378
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:37,919
coarser scale. So when you when you blow

379
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:40,720
this up um uh if you blow it up then you

380
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,520
get delta 2 balls

381
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,080
and delta 2 tubes

382
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:51,600
in the unit ball.

383
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:55,000
So this guy is bounded by the uh ra of

384
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,000
delta 2.

385
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,440
Okay, I'm going call this claim one and

386
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,440
claim two.

387
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,640
All right,

388
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,200
so this picture is perhaps the most

389
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,480
important thing uh to take away from

390
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,320
this proof and this class. So take a

391
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,799
moment and see if you have questions

392
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,799
about this proof.

393
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,960
ready to verify.

394
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,799
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is do we

395
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,799
need to check that everything is ad

396
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,400
regular? Yeah. Okay. So let me add to

397
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,640
these claims and then if we want to

398
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,840
we'll we'll prove we can add details to

399
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,760
the proof of these claims. E E1 and T1

400
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,400
obey the hypothesis and they're ad

401
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,480
regular. And we need that this blow up

402
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
here obeys the hypothesis and it's ad

403
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,600
regular. And if you believe those two

404
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,159
things, then you can plug you just plug

405
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,159
in and you get that.

406
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,279
Yeah. And we we can talk a little bit

407
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,400
more about those two things if you want.

408
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,400
Are there other questions or comments?

409
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,080
Okay. So, I'll probably add a little

410
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,919
more, but actually I wanted to ask you

411
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,760
all a question. Um, in this argument,

412
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:40,840
where did we take advantage of the fact

413
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,840
that the original E was ad regular?

414
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah. Jonathan,

415
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,440
>> is it like picking one delta one ball

416
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,840
and magnifying it?

417
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,120
>> Yeah. So, it's related to when we picked

418
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,720
this one delta 1 ball and magnified it.

419
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:07,480
Yeah. So, so let's talk about one and

420
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,480
two a little more carefully. Um,

421
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,760
all right.

422
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:33,360
So let's discuss

423
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:36,080
one and two. Okay. So point one if e and

424
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,919
tx are uniform which we can pretty much

425
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,880
assume in the which we can assume from

426
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,400
the beginning with a little pruning

427
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:52,159
um then um

428
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:54,480
e delta t implies that e1 is delta1 t

429
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,480
and

430
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
tx

431
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,480
um

432
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:09,559
delta s implies that t1x

433
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,559
is is delta 1x.

434
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:19,679
Okay. And also uh if E is ad regular

435
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,279
it implies that E1 is AD regular

436
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,480
because this is saying all the branching

437
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,679
numbers of E are the same as each other

438
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
and this is saying that all the

439
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,440
branching numbers of E down to the depth

440
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,440
of delta 1 are the same as each other.

441
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,000
Okay,

442
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,279
we didn't need E to be ad regular to do

443
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,799
this or this,

444
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:52,400
but it comes in in part two. So

445
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:56,240
because E is a deregular

446
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,640
then we get that if you take E and you

447
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,039
intersect it with a small ball and

448
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:06,960
magnify it

449
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:11,240
then this is uh a delta I guess delta 2

450
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,240
t and a d regular.

451
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,840
So let me illustrate this with pictures

452
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,080
instead of equations. So what does it

453
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,240
look like? Let's draw an ad regular set

454
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,840
and a not regular set and we'll look at

455
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,240
both of them. Okay. So if E is ad

456
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,640
regular

457
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,640
what I do

458
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,440
I pick say four of them.

459
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,520
Let me do this in the color.

460
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,279
Okay. Then for each one that I picked, I

461
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,279
subdivide it

462
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,840
uh and I pick four of them.

463
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,600
Okay, I'll stop drawing. You get the

464
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,440
idea, right? Okay, now this is a self

465
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,240
similar construction. If I take this

466
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,240
thing in here and I blow it up, it's

467
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,399
just like what I started with. So it

468
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,880
will be a dere regular and it will be in

469
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,960
particular a delta it will be a a delta

470
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,840
t set for the appropriate delta.

471
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay what would it look like if e was

472
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,000
not a d regular?

473
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,919
Well,

474
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,720
for example,

475
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,919
I might do the following thing. Might

476
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,880
cut it into a 4x4 grid. And I might take

477
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,480
all of the boxes. And then I could cut

478
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,279
each of each one of them into a 4x4 grid

479
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,799
and pick just one box.

480
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,480
So this was the, you know, the well

481
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,480
spaced example that we drew last time.

482
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,200
Okay. So this whole thing is a delta t

483
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,360
set. But if I took just one of these

484
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
boxes, what I would see is much more

485
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,919
concentrated. This is not a delta t set.

486
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,919
So if I were to take this guy

487
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,360
and take it out here and magnify it,

488
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:31,360
then inside of here, I would just see

489
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:36,159
this. This here is a blank T set. But

490
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,720
this here is not a blank T- set.

491
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,640
Whereas in the AD regular case, if I

492
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,760
were to take one of these and bring it

493
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,840
out and magnify it, then what I would

494
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,799
see in here would be very similar to the

495
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:55,840
original set. This is um

496
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:59,039
similar to B. So this here is a

497
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,120
blank T set and it's a dregular. And

498
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,640
that thing in there is still a blank T

499
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,640
set and it's still ad regular.

500
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,640
Okay, so this is the special feature of

501
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,080
ad regular. The word regular refers to

502
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,039
the fact that all the different scales

503
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,279
look the same. And so when we uh look

504
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,200
inside this ball here, we have another

505
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,919
example of our original problem at a

506
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,159
coarser scale. And that feeds into an

507
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,600
inductive argument and we can say for

508
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,840
example we can say this sub

509
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,799
multiplicative lema.

510
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,200
>> Yeah first inequality over there do you

511
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,159
need some sort of uniformity on the

512
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,320
number of

513
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,960
cuz like the average and you're saying

514
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,960
something like the average.

515
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,559
>> Yeah that's right. That's right. So so

516
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,480
um

517
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,240
yes that is a good point. Okay, so the

518
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,240
comment is that RA was defined as an

519
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,320
average number of delta tubes per delta

520
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,720
ball. And here I was pretending that all

521
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:08,960
the tubes are average. Um so

522
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,440
let's call this a proof sketch.

523
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Um you do need some uniformity. If you

524
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,399
think back to the original setting, you

525
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,120
know, you have the set E and then you

526
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,760
draw all these tubes. You can sort them

527
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,159
by how many delta tubes are in each one

528
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,279
and you take the category that has the

529
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,720
most delta tubes and that will still you

530
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559
can work with that. So you can do it you

531
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,960
you you're correct. You we have to

532
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,120
uniformize it. Um and it is possible to

533
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,399
uniformize it.

534
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay. So let me scribe that. So um

535
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,080
um

536
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,080
can do some

537
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,080
uniformizing

538
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:54,120
so all tubes

539
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,120
have the same number of balls.

540
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,640
Okay, other questions or comments?

541
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,159
Okay. Cool.

542
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,760
All right. So, this little lema is very

543
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,120
important. Um, for people who have some

544
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,279
seen some other things in harmonic

545
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,960
analysis, there's a submative lema

546
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,880
that's sort of like this in decoupling

547
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,039
theory and it's the beginning of what's

548
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
special about decoupling. If those words

549
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,320
don't mean anything to you, don't worry

550
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,720
about it. Um so let me show you some uh

551
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,159
corlary some applications of this lema

552
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,080
and then we'll um and then we'll sort of

553
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,080
go in earnest into using it to prove

554
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,159
this theorem.

555
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,159
All right.

556
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,950
[Applause]

557
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
All

558
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,000
right. So the first application is sort

559
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,720
of tongue and cheek

560
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,880
but uh also I I I think it's

561
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,670
philosophically important. I'm going to

562
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,159
call it so applications.

563
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:18,279
[Applause]

564
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,279
I'm gonna call it uh brute force proof

565
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:27,440
of a theorem of theorem um of the the ad

566
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,840
regular case.

567
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,919
So here's how it goes.

568
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,559
Um

569
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,960
so for some

570
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:44,200
for some specific delta knot

571
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,200
we check by brute force

572
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:53,360
that r a d

573
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,240
s delta kn is bounded by um the right

574
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,159
hand side

575
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,360
and we won't be able to get it perfectly

576
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,360
but we could get something like

577
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,200
Okay. So, how could you do this? Once

578
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,679
you fix a particular delta knot, like

579
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,839
one over a million, there are really

580
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,839
only finitely many different ways you

581
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,359
could arrange the delta balls. And there

582
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,119
are really only finitely many ways you

583
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,879
could put the tubes. So, there's a giant

584
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
brute force calculation that you

585
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,240
couldn't really do, but we could

586
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:28,159
imagine. And you could just check this.

587
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:32,200
Once you have this then you use the

588
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,200
submultiplicative lema

589
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,679
many times.

590
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:44,320
Um and so you know when you used it once

591
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,879
you would get ra s delta kn squared that

592
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,040
would be bounded by right hand side

593
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,760
times delta kn squar to the minus

594
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,599
epsilon

595
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,599
because the the right hand side is just

596
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,880
a power delta kn. So it multiplies

597
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,880
everything fits and you you keep going.

598
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,280
Okay, so of course this so this brute

599
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,119
force computation is so large that it's

600
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,119
out of the question to do it even with a

601
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,240
supercomputer etc. Um, nevertheless, it

602
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,520
is worth noticing that this very

603
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,040
difficult theorem has a one blackboard

604
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,359
proof up to a brute force computation.

605
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,800
Up to a finite computation. Most

606
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,320
difficult theorems in math, it's not

607
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,240
obvious how to reduce to a finite

608
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,520
computation. I wouldn't say this is

609
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,640
obvious either, but for most difficult

610
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,400
theorems in math, there's not a

611
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,839
half-page argument to reduce it to a

612
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,520
finite computation. For this one, there

613
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,520
is, but it shows that this is quite

614
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
important.

615
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,599
Okay, let me give another application.

616
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,200
Um, second application is the general

617
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:03,400
case

618
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,400
general ad versus the projective ad.

619
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,240
Um, okay. So, the course was called

620
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,680
projection theory. Uh, and at the

621
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
beginning we talked about problems about

622
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,079
orthogonal projections. And this theorem

623
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,200
is really more general. I guess I've

624
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,200
erased the theorem. The theorem we're

625
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,560
talking about today is more general than

626
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,320
just orthogonal projections. Um, and if

627
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,760
you had some orthogonal projections, the

628
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,880
way you would get all these tubes is you

629
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,280
would pick a direction from your

630
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,800
direction set. And then you would get a

631
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,200
bunch of tubes in that direction that

632
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,800
cover your set.

633
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:41,560
So um, so I make a definition.

634
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,560
Let's say that ET is projective

635
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,079
If

636
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,520
for every X and E,

637
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,000
the direction set of the tubes TX, let

638
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,400
me put it this way, for every X1 and X2

639
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,119
and E, the direction of the tubes

640
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,359
through X1 is the same as the direction

641
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,200
of the tubes through X2.

642
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,760
In other words, you have just one set of

643
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,359
directions and TX is all the tubes

644
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,119
through X in that set of directions.

645
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,480
Okay, so if you think about the general

646
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,320
the problem that we wrote down, this is

647
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,400
a very special case. So it used to be at

648
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,960
every point you picked your own

649
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
independent set of tubes, but now

650
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,839
there's an extra rule that that the

651
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,960
directions have to be the same at each

652
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,680
point. It's a very special case.

653
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:35,040
Okay, so

654
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:38,880
let's say RA a projection of delta is uh

655
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:43,200
the maximum over the usual stuff. So ET

656
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:47,800
obeys our hypothesis. Uh E is a regular

657
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,800
but also ET is projective.

658
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,720
All right.

659
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Cool.

660
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,079
So um

661
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,680
in general that you know that we're

662
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,240
taking a maximum and this is a

663
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,680
restricted maximum. So we clearly have

664
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:17,839
that ra a projective

665
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,599
is smaller than rather

666
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,359
more cases

667
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,599
but it turns out that they're basically

668
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,560
equal to each other. So let's make that

669
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:31,440
a lema.

670
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,040
So r a d of delta is less than here

671
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,640
there are some fudge factors so I'll

672
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,440
write something like this c epsilon

673
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,440
delta to the minus epsilon

674
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,720
actually let me I don't quite say that

675
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,200
that's true but

676
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,119
let me just say something uh okay so

677
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,079
here so here's a cool observation based

678
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,079
on that diagram and that proof

679
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,640
so notice

680
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,640
that in the uh sub multip applicative

681
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,640
lama.

682
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,079
If um delta 1 equals delta 2= square

683
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,160
root of delta,

684
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,920
then

685
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,839
the

686
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:19,000
inner uh the the small ball problems are

687
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,000
all projective.

688
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,119
Okay.

689
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,640
So in this in this problem we sort of we

690
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,480
have a a delta scale

691
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,480
>> fenberg problem and we broke it up into

692
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,720
two pieces a coarse piece at the large

693
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,359
scale and a piece a small piece inside

694
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,119
each small ball. Okay so I claim that

695
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,040
this piece inside the small ball is

696
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,880
projective.

697
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,880
Why is it? Well,

698
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,640
so pick one of these points and I'm

699
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,200
going to look at the directions of the

700
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,480
red tubes going through this point.

701
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,480
Um, now I'm working in this small ball,

702
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,200
so I can only distinguish them up to an

703
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,200
angle of square root of delta.

704
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,520
So what directions will they be? They'll

705
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,920
be the directions of these orange tubes

706
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,079
going out through here.

707
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,119
So, so there there could well be two

708
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,359
long red tubes going through here in the

709
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,440
that are in the same orange tube, but

710
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,280
inside of this small ball, they'll just

711
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,520
be on top of each other. I won't see any

712
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,440
difference between them.

713
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,599
So, the directions that I'll see within

714
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,880
the small ball, they just correspond to

715
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,280
these orange tubes.

716
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,800
And if I look at different guys inside

717
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,119
the small ball, I have the same set of

718
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,119
orange tubes.

719
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,800
Okay, so that gives me an inequality

720
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:03,599
r a delta is bounded by

721
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,359
R a D delta to the half times R A D

722
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,800
projective

723
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,920
delta to the 12.

724
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
Yeah,

725
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,960
>> I thought that you were writing

726
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,560
projective,

727
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,680
>> right? Only the inner one is projective.

728
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,680
The outer one is arbitrary.

729
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,680
However, we can repeat this.

730
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:32,079
So now that's bounded by RA a delta to

731
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,240
the quarter R A projective delta to the

732
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,720
quarter

733
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,440
R A projective

734
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,440
delta to the half.

735
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,000
And now you can keep going.

736
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,880
Okay, so you do this many times.

737
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There'll be a T appendix left here that

738
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,079
is still has no projective on it, but

739
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,440
it'll be very minor. And the rest of

740
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:02,040
them all have projective. And so the

741
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,040
conclusion is that to prove the theorem,

742
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,160
it suffices to check the projective

743
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,160
case.

744
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,920
So that's a cute application of being

745
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,920
submitted.

746
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,839
Okay.

747
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,560
So those are a couple of cute

748
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,560
applications of this lama. Yeah.

749
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,400
>> Is that like extra r that kind of went

750
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,119
over epsilon

751
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,760
uh kind of where the delta epsilon kind

752
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,920
of error term final or is there as well?

753
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,839
>> There are several places where we might

754
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,599
incur a delta to the epsilon in the

755
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,760
final thing and this is one of them.

756
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,920
Yeah.

757
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,560
Yeah.

758
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,000
Okay. Um,

759
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,599
so let's say something big picture about

760
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
trying to prove this theorem.

761
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,400
So we were saying yesterday that for a

762
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
while in this subject there were only

763
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,400
kind of there were only epsilon

764
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,800
improvements on some classical things.

765
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,960
And what was very striking to me is to

766
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,040
go from just making epsilon improvements

767
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,119
to go to making to to proving the sharp

768
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,280
theorem.

769
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,720
And while Pablush Murkin was visiting, I

770
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,200
talked with him a lot about all this

771
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,040
stuff. And he said to me something one

772
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,880
day that really stuck with me. He said

773
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,880
sort of philosophically.

774
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Um

775
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,760
that here, yeah, here's how I would like

776
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:54,240
to put it. Um

777
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,040
that in order to prove this theorem,

778
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:02,079
what we need to do is make an epsilon

779
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,520
improvement on the submicative lema.

780
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,599
So let me write that down because I

781
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,760
think it's worth taking with you out of

782
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,520
this class.

783
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,520
So

784
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,520
philosophy

785
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,440
to prove the theorem

786
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,920
what we need

787
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:31,640
an epsilon improvement

788
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,640
on the sub multiplicative length.

789
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,880
Okay. So in other words, we'd like to

790
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,720
say either

791
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:48,240
one possibility is that ra a d square

792
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,240
root of delta is already obeys the

793
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,240
bound.

794
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,440
Okay. Well then we're happy and you know

795
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,599
by by the sub multiplicative lema our

796
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,760
ide of delta also will obey the bound.

797
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,079
So we'll be happy

798
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,440
or

799
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:11,160
we have so I'll write down the um sub

800
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,160
multiplicative lema.

801
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:24,240
So that's the sub multiplicative lema

802
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:28,599
but or we have not not this lema but a

803
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,599
little tiny improvement on it.

804
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Okay, so in this case of course we're

805
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,200
happy and in this case we can iterate

806
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,760
and so you can think of ra of delta as

807
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,640
being some power of delta

808
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,960
and then every time we do this that

809
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,800
power goes down

810
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,400
uh or some negative power of delta.

811
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,079
Every time we do this, that power is

812
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,839
going to go down. Um and um uh and so

813
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,640
it'll keep going down until we get into

814
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,640
this case and we're happy.

815
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,280
So

816
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,800
so let's illustrate that. So if say we

817
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:16,319
have ra a delta

818
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,760
um let me write it this way be easier as

819
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,880
delta to the minus gamma then we'd have

820
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,160
ra a d of delta squared

821
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,880
would be bounded by um so this would

822
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,760
give us delta to the minus 2 gamma but

823
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,760
plus epsilon

824
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,920
Then we would do this again.

825
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:49,359
RA a D delta 4th would be bounded by

826
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,680
delta 4 to the minus gamma plus epsilon

827
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,880
plus epsilon. We keep going and this

828
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,240
exponent keeps getting better and better

829
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,480
until we can't make an epsilon

830
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,920
improvement anymore. So if we have this

831
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,920
dichotomy then we can get um the

832
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,920
theorem.

833
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,079
Okay.

834
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,079
Cool.

835
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,079
Um

836
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,359
all right. So so then you might reflect

837
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,240
well you know why is it easier to make

838
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:23,119
an epsilon improvement kind of theorem

839
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,160
than it is to uh you know prove a really

840
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,079
sharp bound straight out. Well, there's

841
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,520
a thought process for that. If we have

842
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,119
we already have a result and then we

843
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,560
want to make an epsilon improvement,

844
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,240
then we say to ourselves, you know, what

845
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,160
would it look like if the result we have

846
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,040
is sharp

847
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,400
and maybe there's a lot of specific

848
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,079
things that have to happen for the

849
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,800
result we have to be sharp. So, we get a

850
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,160
lot of structure and then we have then

851
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,440
we have to get a contradiction and that

852
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,040
shows you can do just a little bit

853
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,319
better. That's why an epsilon

854
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,160
improvement result is is easier than um

855
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,000
than just getting a a great balance

856
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,920
straight away. And you know and when we

857
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,359
so you know if if we go back to Bans's

858
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,040
projection theorem and we tried to make

859
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,760
you know epsilon improvement in a in a

860
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,119
projection theorem well we we didn't say

861
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,720
this at the time but it might have been

862
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,319
good to say you know what would it be

863
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,160
like what would it mean if the bound we

864
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,680
have so far is sharp would mean we have

865
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,680
this structure and that structure and

866
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,359
eventually we have this subset that is

867
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,359
almost closed under addition and almost

868
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,359
closed under multiplication anda d

869
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,599
Okay, so the idea is we are going to try

870
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,359
to do the same thing. We're going to

871
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,599
think about what would it mean if the

872
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,359
sub multiplicative lema was sharp and

873
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,839
we're going to see that it just means

874
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,079
the set has to have a lot of structure

875
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,319
and eventually we'll get down maybe not

876
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,119
today but eventually

877
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,960
orin and smirkin uh got down to to the

878
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,559
structures got down to the banan

879
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,559
projection theorem or um and got a

880
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,559
contradiction

881
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,839
okay

882
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,839
so let's talk about what would it mean

883
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,839
if the sub multiplic Licative llama is

884
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,839
sharp.

885
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,480
Okay. So let me draw a couple pictures

886
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,160
for you. And one of the pictures it

887
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,319
corresponds to the sub multiplicative

888
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,960
lamina is sharp and in the other one it

889
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,760
it it's not.

890
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,760
Okay.

891
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,760
So,

892
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,559
so we'll have some fat balls in a fat

893
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,559
tube.

894
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,000
And

895
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:23,839
then in each fat tube, in each fat ball,

896
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
we have some little balls.

897
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,000
And the little balls are in little

898
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
tubes.

899
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,559
So there's your typical little tube and

900
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,800
okay in each of these balls there are

901
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,280
some each of these back balls there are

902
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,280
some little balls.

903
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,119
Okay.

904
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,680
So in the scenario in this picture would

905
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,880
the sub multiplicative lema be sharp or

906
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:08,000
not sharp?

907
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,359
Stand next to the picture

908
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,839
in this picture. Would the sub

909
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,839
multiplicative lema be sharp or not

910
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,839
sharp?

911
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,400
I don't think it's sharp because there's

912
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,920
just one tube for the like coarser

913
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:30,319
scale. that could be consist of several

914
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:32,960
tubes for the fine scale.

915
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,119
>> Um, okay. So, let me clarify what this

916
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,520
is a picture of.

917
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,079
So, so there are many coarse scale

918
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,920
tubes, but I just drew one of them. And

919
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,720
I'm just drawing what's happening inside

920
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,280
of one of them. So, inside of that one

921
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,559
coarse tube, this is what we see based

922
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,000
on this is the

923
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,599
>> So, there's only one fine scale tube. Um

924
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,160
there could be more fine scale tubes but

925
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,319
this is a typical one. Yes, there are

926
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,520
many orange tubes and many red tubes but

927
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:06,280
I'm drawing uh only one of each to

928
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,280
direct your to focus our attention.

929
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,000
Okay, so let's review for a second the

930
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,520
proof of the sub multiplicative lama uh

931
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,599
because it's really important and maybe

932
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:21,839
it'll go in a little deeper and then

933
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,880
I'll try this again. Okay, so our goal

934
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:28,319
is to estimate ra of delta, which is the

935
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,640
number of delta balls per delta tube.

936
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,400
So I picked a delta tube like this red

937
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,640
one here. I I have to estimate the

938
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,200
number of delta balls in it. First I

939
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,720
estimate the number of fat balls that it

940
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,720
intersects

941
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,040
and then I multiply that by the number

942
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,559
of delta balls that it intersects within

943
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:50,160
each fat ball. And that was my bat.

944
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,000
And that each one of those things I

945
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,880
bounded sort of by induction and I got

946
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,119
those two members. All right. So

947
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,040
if I take a particular fat tube and

948
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:06,839
inside of it a particular thin tube and

949
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,839
I see this would that argument be sharp?

950
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:13,119
Right. Okay. So so the suggestion is

951
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:16,079
that this is not sharp because uh inside

952
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,400
of this red tube most of the fat balls

953
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,240
are contributed nothing.

954
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,240
And only this one fat ball is

955
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,240
contributing.

956
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,640
And it would be sharp if the number of

957
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,400
delta balls in the fat ball was the

958
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,920
number of sorry the number of delta

959
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,720
balls in the delta tube was the number

960
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,079
of fat balls times the number of delta

961
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,520
balls in one of them. So let me show. So

962
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,040
this is not sharp. And let me draw the

963
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,480
one that's sharp. You'll see the

964
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,480
difference. This is not sharp.

965
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,240
Delta tube

966
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,240
should look like this,

967
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,359
right? So the delta tube should

968
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,359
intersect a bunch of fat balls. It

969
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,160
should intersect that many fat balls as

970
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,880
many as possible. And inside each one of

971
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,640
them, it should intersect a lot of delta

972
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,400
balls, as many as possible. That's what

973
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,480
it takes for the sub multiplicative lema

974
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,200
to be sharp.

975
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,540
So it should look like this. So this is

976
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,610
sharp.

977
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,610
[Applause]

978
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,319
Okay.

979
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,319
Um,

980
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,480
and this is a kind of striking picture.

981
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,480
Um,

982
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,880
right. So

983
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,200
in this ball, these points are in just a

984
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,720
few tubes in a certain direction. Could

985
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,240
also imagine we're in the projective

986
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,880
case. And in these other balls, the

987
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,720
points are in those same tubes.

988
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,160
Goes all the way across. Of course, the

989
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,680
balls don't have to look exactly the

990
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,640
same as each other. So maybe a better

991
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,640
picture might be like so.

992
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,720
But the the tubes are exactly the same.

993
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,880
Okay.

994
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,880
Okay. So,

995
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:08,400
let me pause. I'm going to erase a

996
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,040
little bit to make some space around

997
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,720
here. Is that okay with everybody? that

998
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,160
if the sub multiplicative lema is sharp,

999
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,720
it has to look like this, not like that.

1000
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,119
Okay. All right. So, let's erase around

1001
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,119
here a little bit.

1002
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:35,960
Okay. So, um we already reduced to the

1003
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,960
projective case.

1004
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,559
So let's say D is the set of directions

1005
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,240
which is the same everywhere as our

1006
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:53,359
projections

1007
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:56,240
and so D is a delta S set in the circle

1008
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:59,040
and here I fixed a typical fat tube. So

1009
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:02,760
here's a typical

1010
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,760
root delta tube.

1011
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,720
Um, and I'm going to look at the angles

1012
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:15,359
that are within this fat tube.

1013
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:19,040
So, um, so let's say,

1014
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:20,880
so here's our circle and, um, there's a

1015
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,640
little range of angles here. This is a

1016
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,760
delta to the here's theta, which is a

1017
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:29,319
delta to the 1/2 arc that corresponds to

1018
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,319
the that tube.

1019
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:42,559
Um okay

1020
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:48,000
and so D is some delta set delta SC set

1021
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:49,839
in here and let's say that C is D

1022
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,160
intersected with theta. So it's just

1023
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,160
these directions.

1024
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,160
Okay.

1025
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:03,040
Um so

1026
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:06,160
so the red tubes correspond to one of

1027
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,960
the directions in theta. So this one

1028
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:12,079
there red tube.

1029
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,880
And um so when I project the set in the

1030
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,559
red direction, I just get a small set.

1031
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,799
But it's not just the red direction. I

1032
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,920
could draw some other directions inside

1033
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:23,920
of the tube also. Let me do one more.

1034
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,359
I'll take here a blue direction inside

1035
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,960
of here.

1036
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,880
So I draw the tubes in the blue

1037
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,640
direction. What would it look like? I

1038
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,720
think I need to make this picture come

1039
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,720
out nicely. I need to add a few more

1040
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,720
points.

1041
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:42,720
And then so there'll be one more red

1042
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,720
tube.

1043
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,720
Oops.

1044
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,720
And now I'll draw a typical blue tube.

1045
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:55,599
The blue tube also manages to intersect

1046
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:59,079
our points a lot. So it should look sort

1047
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,079
of like this.

1048
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:07,280
Okay, I don't think I can draw anymore

1049
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,520
without making a complete mess, but get

1050
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,520
the idea.

1051
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,359
So the blue tube passes through all

1052
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,200
these balls also. And each time the blue

1053
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:22,079
tube passes through a ball, it manages

1054
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:24,880
to line up with one of the red tubes.

1055
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:28,720
All right. Okay.

1056
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:31,920
So, we have a kind of special situation

1057
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:36,319
here with a product structure.

1058
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,559
So, what is our set? Um, so let's say

1059
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,799
over here

1060
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:43,760
these dots this the projection in the

1061
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:47,680
red direction. Let's call this A.

1062
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,400
And then um down here we can make a set

1063
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:55,640
that illustrates where the fat balls are

1064
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,640
in the fat tube. Let's call that B.

1065
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:04,000
And so what we see is that for every C

1066
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,400
in C

1067
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,040
the projection

1068
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:13,200
uh in the C direction or I'll write it

1069
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:15,280
this way. A + C B that's the projection

1070
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:20,319
in the C direction

1071
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:22,400
is not much bigger than A.

1072
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:25,359
So

1073
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,880
the you know the projection in every one

1074
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,440
of these directions is small. They're

1075
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,079
all about the same as each other. A was

1076
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,720
the projection in the red direction. B

1077
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:39,319
the blue one is just as good. So A plus

1078
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,319
CB should be not much bigger than A.

1079
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,520
Okay.

1080
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,880
Okay. So, let me summarize what we have

1081
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,880
seen here.

1082
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,760
Okay.

1083
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:27,520
So

1084
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:31,079
f sub multiplicative lama

1085
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,079
is sharp.

1086
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,040
Um

1087
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:39,440
then

1088
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:42,720
we get sets A and B and C which are

1089
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:46,680
subsets of real numbers.

1090
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,680
And in the main case,

1091
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:57,760
a is a delta a a set.

1092
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:00,640
Well, it's a row a set. Uh size of a is

1093
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:05,040
like row to the minus a.

1094
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:10,559
B is a row B set. Size of B is like row

1095
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:14,240
to the minus B. C is a row C set.

1096
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,760
size of C is like row to the minus C.

1097
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,760
And

1098
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:25,960
for every C in C,

1099
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,960
A + CB is not very much bigger than A.

1100
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,359
Okay. Now, the size of A and B and C can

1101
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,520
all be traced back to the numbers in our

1102
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,680
problem.

1103
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,680
Um and

1104
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:47,280
we find that if uh

1105
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,920
if a is smaller than b + c that's

1106
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:53,839
equivalent to saying that ra a d square

1107
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,720
root of delta is good

1108
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,880
a sorry if a is larger than b plus c

1109
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,880
then that means you do a boring

1110
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,880
computation.

1111
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,799
Um so there's a

1112
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,839
intermediate result maybe I'll call it a

1113
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:15,160
key lema which is called the ABC sum

1114
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,160
product lema

1115
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:22,720
which is goes into this paper of open

1116
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:26,640
schwarin. Uh, and it says if you have

1117
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:30,520
all of this stuff, um, then indeed a is

1118
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,520
bigger than b + c.

1119
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:49,000
Okay, let's yeah,

1120
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
>> good means that it obeys the theorem.

1121
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:02,000
Um so the theorem's up there. So smaller

1122
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:07,359
than the maximum of one and

1123
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:11,680
root delta to the minus t / 2 + s / 2

1124
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:13,760
and root delta to the 1us t.

1125
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,920
So if if that's the case, we're we're

1126
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:20,920
happy. And otherwise uh yeah. Okay.

1127
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,920
Right.

1128
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,280
Okay. So, let's go back to our general

1129
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,640
strategy, our big our big picture

1130
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,960
strategy. We'd like to prove this

1131
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,039
theorem that RA of delta is always

1132
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,960
smaller than that.

1133
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,559
And we consider the sub multiplicative

1134
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,920
limit which doesn't give us the theorem

1135
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,640
yet, but it's an important tool.

1136
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,039
And we'd like to say

1137
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,720
um

1138
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,039
uh

1139
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,559
if if the if we can have an epsilon

1140
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,359
improvement in the sub multiplicative

1141
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,440
lema then that's great. We go to the

1142
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,559
next scale and we have a better bound.

1143
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,039
So you keep doing that until you stop

1144
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,799
and we must stop in a situation where

1145
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,760
there's no more where the sub

1146
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:04,960
multiplicative lema becomes sharp.

1147
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,799
And maybe that's a better way to say it.

1148
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,920
We have the sub multiplicative lama. we

1149
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,839
use it. It's either sharp or it's not.

1150
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,319
If it's not, we get a, you know, a nicer

1151
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:17,599
exponent at at delta squared than we did

1152
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:18,799
at delta. We keep doing that and the

1153
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,319
exponent is not going to keep getting

1154
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:21,920
better forever. So, we stop at some

1155
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:25,119
moment where the sub multiplicative lama

1156
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,720
is basically sharp.

1157
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,280
But the fact that the sub multiplicative

1158
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:32,640
lama is sharp gives us a lot of

1159
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,720
structure. It gives us uh the structure

1160
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,039
of being projective

1161
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,359
and it gives us this kind of product

1162
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:41,039
structure and it leads us to this

1163
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,440
problem which looks a lot like additive

1164
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:46,720
combinotaurics and which is very special

1165
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:49,359
problem compared to our original setup.

1166
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,440
Um okay and then the bound we need to

1167
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:53,680
prove for this problem if you just

1168
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,400
unwind the computation we need to prove

1169
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:59,440
this bound for this problem and if you

1170
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:03,880
unwind it it will tell us that um that

1171
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,880
ra obeys the desired bound

1172
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:10,000
yeah row I guess row is also row here is

1173
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,000
square root of delta

1174
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah.

1175
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,240
Okay.

1176
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:31,440
Okay. So this situation

1177
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:35,039
is now a lot more structured than what

1178
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,920
we started with and it looks reminiscent

1179
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:40,720
of uh additive cominatorics maybe of

1180
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,720
brian projection theorem and so on and

1181
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,799
indeed they were able to deal with it

1182
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,440
with that toolkit.

1183
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:48,799
I could say a little I don't I don't

1184
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,079
want to write too many equations so I

1185
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,440
won't say the whole thing. I could say a

1186
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:57,039
little bit about it. Um, but I I think

1187
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,880
that what we've done so far is what what

1188
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,760
I feel is most worth remembering about

1189
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,520
the proof of this theorem. So, let's

1190
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:07,400
pause here and see if people have any

1191
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,400
questions or comments about

1192
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:34,240
Let me let me summarize it.

1193
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,799
So the ad regular case is special

1194
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,760
because all the scales are related to

1195
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:41,680
each other and so we can break it up

1196
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,640
into problems at different scales and

1197
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,880
put them together. And by doing that we

1198
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,480
get problems that are somewhat nicer. So

1199
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,400
first of all if we look at the problem

1200
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,960
in a small ball instead of the original

1201
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,200
problem it becomes nicer because the

1202
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,119
directions through any point are the

1203
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,480
same for any two points. the directions

1204
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,000
are the same because they correspond to

1205
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,000
the directions of the fat tube through

1206
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,799
there. So this already made it a little

1207
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,160
bit nicer.

1208
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:11,440
Then moreover in order for the sub

1209
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,440
multiplicative lema to be sharp. So if

1210
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,839
the sub multiplicative lema is not sharp

1211
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,759
then you just keep going down scales and

1212
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,279
you keep getting better exponents and

1213
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,839
eventually that has to stop when the sub

1214
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,359
multiplicative lema is sharp. when the

1215
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,679
sub multiplicative lema is sharp,

1216
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,520
there's even more structure because

1217
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,480
these different balls have to talk to

1218
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,960
each other. Um, and so if you know

1219
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,640
there's a if if you see in this ball,

1220
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,319
you see a tube here, then you have to

1221
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,319
see a tube in the same place in that

1222
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,159
ball.

1223
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:44,000
Um, and that means that this set of

1224
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:46,239
points has kind of a product structure.

1225
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,480
And in particular if you what what's

1226
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:51,520
literally true is that if you take this

1227
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:54,400
uh well anyway so if you if you take the

1228
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,159
set of red tubes in this ball and then

1229
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:00,159
in this ball and then in this ball that

1230
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:02,880
is a product which is very helpful.

1231
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:05,520
Okay. Um

1232
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:09,120
cool. So,

1233
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,960
so the the the ad regular case allows us

1234
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,679
to restrict to a situation which has a

1235
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,000
lot more structure and uh it restricts

1236
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,520
to to to this lema about projections of

1237
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,400
a product set.

1238
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,239
>> Okay. Yeah. Um, so the argument like can

1239
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:27,120
continue sort of until the

1240
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:29,679
more is sharp. How do you know that kind

1241
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,359
of sharpness corresponds to kind of the

1242
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,199
sort of

1243
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:37,120
delta to the epsilon factor rather than

1244
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:39,199
just kind of something much smaller?

1245
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,480
It's seems like I don't I don't

1246
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,199
understand how to kind of get a

1247
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,880
quantitative bound kind of a more

1248
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:48,319
qualitative proof by contradiction.

1249
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,839
>> Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the quest this

1250
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:53,279
question is about keeping track of the

1251
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:56,719
small parameters. So every time I apply

1252
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,600
the sub multiplicative lema

1253
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,040
I was using the word sharp or not sharp

1254
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,800
but of course there's some kind of a

1255
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,040
gray zone and I have to decide where I'm

1256
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,199
going to cut how how what am I going to

1257
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:12,320
consider to be sharp and what is not

1258
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:16,159
sharp. Um and um then

1259
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:18,000
in this analysis um

1260
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:20,400
uh

1261
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
um yeah okay so so actually so in in

1262
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,480
order for this to stop in a reasonable

1263
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,360
amount of time I'm going to have to have

1264
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:30,080
a cutoff that's a tiny power of delta

1265
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:34,000
otherwise this would go on too long

1266
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:35,679
wouldn't work. Um, so my so I would say

1267
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,360
um

1268
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,360
uh

1269
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,360
so what would the definition of sharp

1270
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,600
be?

1271
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,600
Keep that.

1272
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:53,520
[Applause]

1273
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:56,239
All right, let's get rid of this stuff.

1274
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,679
So we're going to we're going to use the

1275
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:02,560
sub multiplicative lama

1276
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:02,560
repeatedly.

1277
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:13,199
And so if ra a d of delta is bigger than

1278
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,920
I need to put something here ra a d of

1279
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:18,480
root delta squared and here I'm going to

1280
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,600
put delta to the epsilon kn where

1281
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,159
epsilon kn is a tiny parameter then I'm

1282
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:29,080
going to call this sharp

1283
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,080
and I'm going to stop and analyze

1284
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:35,360
the Other possibility is that RA A of

1285
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:38,719
delta is less than delta to the epsilon

1286
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:41,120
KN RA a

1287
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:44,400
root delta squared. And here I'm making

1288
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:47,520
progress. So I'll keep going. So this is

1289
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:51,239
the not sharp case.

1290
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,239
So now I'll keep going.

1291
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,199
Okay. So that's that's if we're more

1292
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:02,159
careful about what is sharp and not

1293
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:04,080
sharpening. All right. So here um if I

1294
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,800
keep going every time I make a definite

1295
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,320
amount of progress and so uh this this

1296
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,920
actually cannot keep going forever

1297
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,840
because eventually the exponents would

1298
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,320
be negative instead of positive. So it

1299
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,840
will stop. So we will end up here. Once

1300
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,400
we end up here we have to analyze the

1301
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,480
sharp case and we do have to remember it

1302
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:23,920
wasn't perfectly sharp but we had a

1303
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,920
fudge factor of a tiny power of delta

1304
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,960
and that complicates all the pictures

1305
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,560
that we have drawn. So in this picture

1306
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,600
here,

1307
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,760
this tube goes through many fat tubes.

1308
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,880
It doesn't have to have many delta balls

1309
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,880
in all of them. It has to have many

1310
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,960
delta balls in a fraction like delta to

1311
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,239
the epsilon, not fraction of them. It

1312
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,000
makes the picture a little bit more

1313
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:51,920
complicated. Um and actually because of

1314
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,679
that in in this theorem,

1315
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:59,040
if we're honest, it's a little bit more

1316
01:12:53,679 --> 01:13:04,000
complicated. It's not um so it's um

1317
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:07,360
this would actually be pi c of x where x

1318
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:11,640
is a subset of a cross b and it's like a

1319
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,640
delta to the epsilon subset.

1320
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,920
So we wouldn't have to fill the whole

1321
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,840
product. we'd only have.

1322
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,280
Okay. So for that's what how we would be

1323
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,159
careful about sharp and how we would

1324
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,159
have to be more careful here.

1325
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:31,120
Okay. Um let me tell you just the first

1326
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:34,360
idea of the of the proof of um of this

1327
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,360
key lama.

1328
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:44,000
So um so we have

1329
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:47,360
just a step proof

1330
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,840
um so we have a plus cb is only a little

1331
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,960
bit bigger than a

1332
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,159
um that reminds us of plunicus. So an

1333
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,000
appropriate version of plunicusia

1334
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:59,360
well okay we have this big subset x we

1335
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,280
might want to get rid of that by doing

1336
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:07,120
bix gowers. Um so a val 80 hours would

1337
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,840
reduce

1338
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:14,719
to um a prime plus c b prime smaller

1339
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:17,840
than a prime we actually have all of it

1340
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:21,280
instead of just a big piece of it and

1341
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,560
then uh plunicus

1342
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,080
[Applause]

1343
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:29,280
would give us so this would be true for

1344
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:31,840
man c and c

1345
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:36,000
and that would give us a prime prime

1346
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:38,800
plus C1 B prime plus C2 B prime plus C3

1347
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:43,040
B prime would still be smaller than A

1348
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:45,199
prime could get that from plunicus

1349
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:48,000
okay and so now you we're not done yet

1350
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:49,760
but you sort of have the feeling that

1351
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
we keep using these tools from additive

1352
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,640
commentary we keep having stronger and

1353
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:59,080
stronger sounding uh information about A

1354
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,080
and B more and more suspicious

1355
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,719
okay And it definitely takes some some

1356
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,480
skill and some some good ideas to to

1357
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,520
finish from here. But we're in a setting

1358
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,520
where the tools of additive

1359
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:13,800
combinatorics are quite powerful and

1360
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,800
they're able to analyze what happens.

1361
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,719
Okay, good.

1362
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,840
Any final questions or comments?

1363
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,520
>> Yeah.

1364
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,360
>> How did we reduce the projected case? we

1365
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,640
reduced to the projective case at the

1366
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:39,440
beginning. Um we said uh so after we had

1367
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:42,320
the um sub multiplicative lama we

1368
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,120
reduced to the projective case by saying

1369
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,719
that um this ball is in the projective

1370
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:50,960
case.

1371
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:52,719
Um and so using that we were able to

1372
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,960
show that it suffices to prove it for

1373
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,400
the projective case.

1374
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,640
How do you put that? How do you chain

1375
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,640
that argument?

1376
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,600
>> What's that like? Like like I I don't

1377
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:08,880
understand how you use uh like that kind

1378
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,640
of argument and the and the reduction at

1379
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,320
the same time.

1380
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,000
>> Ah um so the question is about how we

1381
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,600
put together reducing to the projective

1382
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,440
case with all the other things that we

1383
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:24,960
did. Yeah. Um

1384
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,880
um okay. So,

1385
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,880
so using this lama, we had an argument

1386
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,440
that if you could prove a good bound for

1387
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,440
the projective case, then combining it

1388
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,440
with this lama and and noticing that

1389
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,760
this is projective that then we get a

1390
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,280
good bound for the general case. So now

1391
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,080
we just imagine we're trying to prove

1392
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,080
the theorem in the projective case.

1393
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,320
Um so we can assume that we're in the

1394
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,320
projective case

1395
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,719
and then we start applying the sub

1396
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,560
multiplicative lema.

1397
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:57,320
Um

1398
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,320
ah so you're wondering when we do this

1399
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:05,520
yeah you can so you can think of this in

1400
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:08,719
this picture um where over here we have

1401
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,880
um not just some abstract thing but the

1402
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,760
this would be the R in the small ball

1403
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:17,360
and the R for the fat tubes. So, we look

1404
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,040
at those and if if the R if the R is

1405
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,280
better than multiplying the small balls

1406
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,760
times the fat tubes, then we keep

1407
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:26,239
breaking things up. Take the small balls

1408
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,000
and break them into smaller balls. And

1409
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:32,120
otherwise, if if they're comparable,

1410
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,120
then we look at at what's happening.

1411
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:38,880
>> Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah.

1412
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:42,159
>> So, I understand uh what's going on. Is

1413
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,000
this example uh supposed to be similar

1414
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:46,880
to the case B that we had at the

1415
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,360
beginning where like for instance if we

1416
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,440
started with tubes and points on a

1417
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,760
bridge would we kind of immediately fall

1418
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,600
just into the situation and what we're

1419
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,440
doing is blowing things up until we get

1420
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,040
there.

1421
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,960
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is how how

1422
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,800
these pictures and these examples relate

1423
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,600
to the the the three examples that we

1424
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,040
had in mind at the beginning. Um so the

1425
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,560
three examples we had in mind at the

1426
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,719
beginning were there was a simple one

1427
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,640
the stars example there was the grid

1428
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,960
that was interesting and there was like

1429
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,800
the random example

1430
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:21,199
and a funny thing is that none of those

1431
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:25,120
is ad regular

1432
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:27,120
right and now the the the

1433
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,000
random one we could fidget to make it ad

1434
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,679
regular if we wanted to um and the stars

1435
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,360
we we could make it ad regular if we

1436
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,520
wanted to but the grid is is actually is

1437
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:37,920
really not adular

1438
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,000
Um and so that is a little bit funny

1439
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,719
that in the most important example is

1440
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,239
not in this case. Um even though this

1441
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,840
case is very important in the final

1442
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:49,360
proof.

1443
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,760
Um so you can't really start with the

1444
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:54,320
grid

1445
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,040
and it is

1446
01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:00,080
not at least until recently it was not

1447
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:03,440
known what is the actual worst behavior

1448
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:07,199
in the AD regular case. It may be so it

1449
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:10,880
may be that RA a is much smaller than R.

1450
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:13,199
Um uh although but the argument so far

1451
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,400
doesn't prove that and that's a little

1452
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:16,159
it's a little bit funny because it means

1453
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,239
there's not an example that you can keep

1454
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:21,199
in mind when you go through the ad

1455
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:22,640
regular case.

1456
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,640
>> Yeah.

1457
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,320
>> What what goes wrong with trying to kind

1458
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,760
construct an ad regular grid where you

1459
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,360
just kind of have a grid wherein each

1460
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,600
point has a lot of sort of nested

1461
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,800
subgrids within it.

1462
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,480
>> Yeah. So the question is could you make

1463
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,560
an ad? Yeah, I guess that's true. You

1464
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:39,440
could make a roughly a somewhat ad

1465
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,280
regular grid by taking a grid of balls

1466
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,040
and then in each one of those balls you

1467
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:48,320
put a grid of balls and you repeat like

1468
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:51,360
this. Um uh but it's not since the grid

1469
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:54,159
itself is not a dregular. This this is

1470
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:58,320
only a it's only a dregular with a big

1471
01:19:54,159 --> 01:20:02,040
c. Um could you do that? Yeah, I guess

1472
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,040
you could do that.

1473
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,440
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you could do that.

1474
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,800
And then what would happen here? The A,

1475
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:14,719
B and C would be like sets of integers

1476
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,040
except they would have this ad regular

1477
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,679
structure. So A would be like take an

1478
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:22,080
arithmetic progression of intervals and

1479
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,679
in each one of them put an arithmetic

1480
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,440
progression of smaller intervals and so

1481
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,760
on. That's what A and B and C would look

1482
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,600
like.

1483
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,960
>> Can you cancept them?

1484
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,280
>> Yeah, it's kind of like a caner. It's

1485
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,440
like a counter set but the but with but

1486
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,600
in order to make it make the numbers

1487
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,280
come out well you you need to have a lot

1488
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,080
of intervals in an arithmetic

1489
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,360
progression in each step. Here I'll draw

1490
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,600
it and then I'm over so I'm going to

1491
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:48,400
stop.

1492
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:51,360
So the example is um for a big line you

1493
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:54,679
make an arithmetic progression with a

1494
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,679
lot of intervals.

1495
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,560
Okay? Then you look inside of each one

1496
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,000
of these intervals and you repeat what I

1497
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,600
just did. Um and for for this to for

1498
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,880
this to be a kind of sharp interesting

1499
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,280
example, it needs to be a lot of

1500
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,760
intervals.

1501
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,920
Okay. Okay. Good. Sorry for going a

1502
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,920
little bit over. Um, those are great

1503
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:21,400
questions. Let's stop there and I will

1504
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,400
see you next week.
