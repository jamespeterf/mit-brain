1
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,320
hello everybody we're to be talking

2
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,200
today about something that sounds really

3
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,719
esoteric really confusing vocabulary

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,440
reduction how do we go to vocabulary

5
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,680
reduction how do we reduce our

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,960
vocabulary are we talking about C Spot

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,320
Run what what does this mean it really

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,440
is about something that we do every time

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,600
we do analysis whether we do music

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,039
analysis or textual analysis or we're

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,519
trying to think about you know what

12
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
really happened um on that last phone

13
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,760
convers ation I had with u you know my

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,960
partner or friend or something like that

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,400
we're trying to reduce the number of

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,000
complexities down to something smaller

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,640
and more manageable and one of the

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,040
places where we do vocabulary reduction

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,400
quite a bit is in Roman numeral analysis

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,280
uh we don't label everything a Roman

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
numeral we tend to label the things

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
depending on who your teacher was maybe

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,079
she or he said we only label things that

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,720
are really chords what is that that mean

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,399
um when we're thinking about how we do

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,159
this as humans we don't really have to

27
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,680
think too much about how we do this we

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,840
just have to get better at doing this

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,360
but if we're going to train a computer

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,640
system to be able to tell us only the

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,880
things that are really there to reduce

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,119
the vocabulary of a score into something

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,920
more manageable then we're going to have

34
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,560
to understand this process quite a bit

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,880
better so that's what we're going to do

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,920
today I'm going to move over to the

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,159
Jupiter notebook and U today I didn't

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,319
have time to make every single thing a

39
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,959
little bit uh you know really polished

40
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,160
so you'll get kind of a sense of how I

41
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,680
how I program how I make up uh

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
assignments for us and how um some of

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,280
the wrong turns that happen along the

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,560
way maybe it'll be useful so let's go

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
over to

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,920
Jupiter okay we're going to start by

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,319
importing from music 21 the Corpus

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,400
method and let's load up a piece by

49
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,959
claraa Schuman her uh Piano Trio slow

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,400
movement one of my favorite pieces and

51
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
we've looked at this uh once in class

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,280
before and it's going to take a little

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,440
bit of time it's a little bit of a

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,440
slower thing you might need to wait

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,280
here okay it's a Piano Trio but it

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,120
begins with just the piano part it's

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,800
really lovely section let me find a

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,800
YouTube video and place that in here

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,280
and you can click on that or just Google

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,000
it find find it in there anyhow the next

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,920
uh eight measures we looked at once in

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,080
class and we can see it it's when the

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,599
violin and the cello enter and the piano

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,400
switches to something else the violin

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,239
playing the same Melody we looked at it

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,840
because of those um those Grace notes

67
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,480
sure if we can highlight that there

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,280
there we go um and they um

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,239
yeah and they were a problem for some of

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,439
our representations of been codings okay

71
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,640
so let's just extract the piano part

72
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,159
from here and you can see some of the

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,439
mistakes that I've made with my own uh

74
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:49,439
music 21 package that this happens I'm

75
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,400
like oh I want to extract two parts uh

76
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,519
first off that should be two to four

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,720
anyhow but in any case it's giving me a

78
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,680
list of um things so I've made two

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,040
mistakes uh that's not giving me a

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,159
stream it's giving me a list I'm going

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,040
to okay now I'm going to do this again

82
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,879
we're going to import the stream we're

83
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:14,599
going to um to create a new score not

84
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:17,519
part for putting things in and we're

85
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,759
going to put in gosh I cannot type piano

86
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,240
after all these uh we're going to put in

87
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,000
part two which is the piano right hand

88
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,919
and we're going to also put in part one

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,520
which is the piano left

90
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,240
hand and

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,840
in order to make this run faster we'll

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,000
just take the first 16 measures uh I put

93
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,440
measure zero just out of habit in case

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
there's a pickup measure there isn't in

95
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,960
this case so I could have really started

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,919
with one so now we're going to look at

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,880
just that little excerpt just the panel

98
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,560
part all that to get rid of some empty

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:58,039
rests but that's kind of okay

100
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,720
here okay so we're going to play um with

101
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,000
just creating the chords of this and

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,080
we'll remember the cify function which

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
is kind of a fun part of Music 21 and

104
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,680
we'll show it and because we're taking a

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,520
trouble cluff and a base cluff put

106
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,919
together in instruments this is always a

107
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,360
little bit wacky uh you kind of get used

108
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:20,479
to counting mcen numbers of uh Ledger

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,000
lines when you are playing with cify and

110
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,120
uh there were times in my life when I

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,800
could actually eyeball that first note

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,800
and say yep that's G I got it but those

113
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,120
times have have passed so instead we're

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,280
going to recurse go through every single

115
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,360
um element in every measure and

116
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,639
everything and get all the chords from

117
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
that c chords is now aart and we're

118
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,039
going to take every one of those chords

119
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,039
which we call C and put it into Clos

120
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,440
position and say that it's going to be

121
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,919
an octave four and uh in place equals

122
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,600
true we're going to replace the old

123
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,319
chord and now we're going to show that

124
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,919
uh the are the same thing and now things

125
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:03,199
look quite a bit better so um yep

126
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,280
there's a thing we can paare back up can

127
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,680
we kind of look at same page yeah a

128
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,280
little bit um yep that's a d down there

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,479
that's a g okay so so it worked worked

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,120
pretty well okay we'll Zoom back in

131
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,360
again so that we can see

132
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,960
great now what we're going to do is we

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,280
want to uh label everything that's

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,160
happening in this so first we're going

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,919
to add analyze the key what key are we

136
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,240
in we're in G major yep uh you'll see

137
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,759
that this is called The Piano Trio in G

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,520
minor but this movement is in G major

139
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,319
great so we're going to uh iterate over

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,880
every one of these chords again and

141
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,199
we're going to create a Roman numeral

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,000
for each of the chords actually we're

143
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,520
going to import the Roman package from

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,639
ran module from music 21 and there's

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,440
this cool thing that you wish you had

146
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,639
your last um time you were programming

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,199
your last problem set Roman numeral from

148
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,680
chord so we're going to take the chord

149
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
and uh say that we want the Roman

150
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,120
numeral in G we're actually going to

151
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,639
create an object uh called Gore major

152
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,440
which is a a variable which is the key

153
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
of G object and the reason for this is

154
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,879
otherwise we would have to create a new

155
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,599
key object for every chord and over time

156
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,720
that becomes slow so what we'll say is

157
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,160
for our original chords we'll give them

158
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,199
the lyrics which are equal to the figure

159
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,000
of the Roman numeral so whatever the

160
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,960
Roman numeral is will asside that to the

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,879
lyric you see it's not the fastest thing

162
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,639
in the world but now you can have it and

163
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,879
we can look at

164
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,120
um we can look at those odd chords in a

165
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,080
little bit you can go ahead and pause

166
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,400
the video if you want to look at them in

167
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,360
more detail have a nice

168
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,039
laugh but I'm just going to uh just get

169
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,639
a quick excerpt the first four measures

170
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,400
that first line there just so we can

171
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,759
compare without having to to move our

172
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,639
eyes up and down a lot

173
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,840
so now we'll compare this to the

174
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,000
original piano part uh with the left and

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,280
the right hands and just see do these

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,639
chords look about right okay yep see

177
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,159
there's that weird thing that that

178
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,280
second chord isn't really a six4 chord

179
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,800
it's really that that low G is still

180
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,080
sustaining and then uh is that a four

181
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,599
chord or is that a five 42 chord it's

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,159
going to be a little bit difficult

183
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,039
because we want to make sure is that a

184
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,560
patura or is that a chord tone it's a

185
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,240
little bit difficult in fact this would

186
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,440
be the challenge problem to be able to

187
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,120
take something where we have arpeggios

188
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,600
Melodies things and Do vocabulary

189
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,760
reduction on a piano part like this this

190
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
is still one of the big unsolved

191
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,200
problems in the field and make being

192
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,800
able to make progress on how do we

193
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,279
reduce the number number of You Know

194
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,480
chords of Roman numerals of analytical

195
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,720
things to only the quote unquote real

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,040
chords on a complex score on a

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,519
orchestral or a piano score is still one

198
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,320
thing that that you could get you know

199
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,279
an A++ you could get complete published

200
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,760
paper out of being able to do that for

201
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,800
now we're going to um and and there are

202
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,760
some great ways to do that we'll uh be

203
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,760
looking at a dissertation by a guy by

204
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,880
the name of Christopher William right uh

205
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,040
at some point for people who are very

206
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,360
interested in such

207
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,240
things we're going to be applying the

208
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,519
concepts of vocabulary reduction to box

209
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,040
four-part Corrals because these this is

210
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,160
music that tends to have all of the

211
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,279
harmonies changing very often and not

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,440
having a lot of the arpeggiation and

213
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,360
things that we were just

214
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,760
seeing you're going to be working in

215
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,560
groups and I'll talk about the problem

216
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
set later but I want to say that there's

217
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,079
two different approaches that you could

218
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,600
be using um and perhaps more to do this

219
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,440
kind of

220
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,079
assignment what I'll be doing in the

221
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,519
rest of the video is an approach where

222
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,760
you start by

223
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,240
labeling every vertical element and then

224
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,800
you start removing ones that don't seem

225
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,480
to actually be chords this is a great

226
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,920
way of working another way of working

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,839
that resembles perhaps a little bit more

228
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,000
closely how we as humans work is to

229
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,160
start by identifying non-harmonic tones

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,160
and putting them all out into various

231
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,000
places and then removing the vertical

232
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,560
chords that are not real

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,839
chords perhaps by also using the

234
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,279
various Roman numeral sections to give

235
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:57,040
you a sense I want to show a little bit

236
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:59,880
one particular B Coral we'll look at the

237
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,079
opening here of a four voice piece and

238
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,880
you can see moments that oh that looks

239
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,040
like a passing tone that looks like it's

240
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:11,120
going to be a little bit um yeah just on

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,480
its way someplace here it looks like a

242
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,519
neighbor

243
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,720
tone this might be a suspension to here

244
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,680
or or this might be a restruck

245
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,279
suspension and so on so we can do it uh

246
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,800
by hand but then how do we train the

247
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,600
computer to do it so that would be one

248
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
type of question and then once you've

249
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
trained a computer to identify these

250
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,399
tones you can create a version where you

251
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,279
remove them and

252
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,240
cified after this comes an essential

253
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,800
step of identifying where various key

254
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,720
changes might

255
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,839
be so regardless of whether you start

256
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,399
with looking at finding passing tones

257
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,399
neighbor tones and so on or start by

258
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,880
looking at every particular chord and

259
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,880
removing the end result ends up being

260
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:05,279
the same and your work can be judged by

261
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,720
how well each various part had been

262
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,920
identified through your

263
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:15,199
process I would suggest if you're

264
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,839
working and dividing up the tasks among

265
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:22,120
people in your group that you start with

266
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,399
the removal of various uh individual

267
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,959
non-harmonic

268
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,720
tones if on the other hand your group

269
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:32,519
chooses to uh work where everybody is

270
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,399
working together at each stage then

271
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,720
perhaps the technique I explained in the

272
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,720
rest of the video where you label chords

273
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,720
first will yield better

274
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,600
results but we can go and do something a

275
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
little bit easier if we stick to Corral

276
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,240
style compositions so we'll go back to

277
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,639
our favorite boach piece bwv 66.6 which

278
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,519
is going to have its own problem in a

279
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,079
little bit but we're going to cify it

280
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm guess get cut and pasting up here

281
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,440
and we're going to again once we cify

282
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,720
everything put it into Clos position put

283
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,880
it into octave 4 and again replace all

284
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,600
the chords in place if you haven't seen

285
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,040
how this technique Works look at music

286
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,720
21 users guide chapter nine and chapter

287
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,680
10 we do that a lot there in fact with

288
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,040
this piece so you'll see um see some new

289
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,120
techniques and be able to do it a little

290
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,120
bit more slowly

291
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,040
so this piece has an interesting

292
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:37,320
characteristic that it ends in a

293
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,240
different key than where it begins so if

294
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,800
we look at the Key of measure 0 to2

295
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,880
using Carol Crum hansel's prob T key

296
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,680
analysis method which is built into

297
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,680
music 21 and we see that it's an a major

298
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,519
but then if we look at the last seven

299
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,279
measures 4 through 10 we see it's an F

300
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,040
minor so we're going to work on each to

301
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,519
the two parts separately so let's first

302
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,880
look at measures 0 to two and get this

303
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,800
excerpt as bords uncore excert should

304
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,880
probably called it excert one whatever

305
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,079
and we can look at those first two

306
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,680
measures and let's use the same

307
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,800
technique that we used with clar Schuman

308
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,680
um to go through each chord and get a

309
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,839
Roman numeral from it and then put the

310
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,120
lyrics in so we can see it we just have

311
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:35,440
to change G major to a major again you

312
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,800
can just put the string a there but I

313
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,320
kind of prefer to do this so we'll do a

314
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,440
major and a major and um kind of

315
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,800
change uh C chords to B chords excerpt

316
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,399
and of course uh a mage is not the same

317
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:56,639
as a major so we'll go ahead and fix

318
00:14:51,399 --> 00:15:00,959
that put that in and now we'll take this

319
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,959
excerpt and show it

320
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,440
and we could see okay it's quite a bit

321
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,759
simpler we have the one 56

322
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,759
six yeah things like that um this is

323
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,519
actually a really good time to

324
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,680
remember uh think about references

325
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,600
because we haven't really talked about

326
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,360
this so this is just the excerpt of just

327
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,120
the two measures when we go back and

328
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,560
look at all of the chords one of the

329
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,959
things you can see is that the figures

330
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:35,759
do sustain back to the that part in

331
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:38,920
other words the chords in the excert are

332
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:43,120
the exact same objects as the chords in

333
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,000
the cify part so what you change on one

334
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,519
of them will change on the other but if

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,839
we go all the way back to the original

336
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,160
bu

337
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,680
part and we show it we'll see that hey

338
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,040
there's no lyrics anywhere anything

339
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,000
because there were no chords there and

340
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,160
we um just can't sort of get back to

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,959
that anyhow that was a little bit of a

342
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,800
digression while we uh look at the Roman

343
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,240
numerals here these look like the kinds

344
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,240
of Roman numerals I was taught uh so

345
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,160
there's not too much too much to do

346
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,959
there so let's go back to the second BL

347
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,000
excerpt the one that's in F minor and

348
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,680
measures 4 through 10 so we'll go ahead

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,399
and get measures 4 through 10 and we'll

350
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:35,240
call that b exer B chords excerpt

351
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,560
2 and measures 4 through 10 when we show

352
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,360
this part you're going to see that

353
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:45,120
there's one problem with uh all of our

354
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,680
um showing things and that is to say

355
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,839
that the the measuring numbers are not

356
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,120
going to be kept but whatever okay so

357
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,600
we're going to go ahead and create a key

358
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,120
of F minor and pause this for one second

359
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:02,399
in the video to see that when we make uh

360
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,799
a key. key object really important to

361
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,600
make a lowercase f if you want to show

362
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,160
that something's minor and I call it Fe

363
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,240
by the way because you can't obviously

364
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,959
put F number sign pound sign to mean a

365
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
sharp sign as a variable because it

366
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,240
would just be a common so we sometimes

367
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,400
use borrow things from other languages

368
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,760
and so FIS Fe is the geran for FSH okay

369
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,160
so getting back

370
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,880
here getting back here we're just doing

371
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,640
the same thing that we did before B

372
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,200
chords exerpt 2 we're getting each of

373
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,799
the chords changing them to ran numerals

374
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
taking that ran numerals figure and make

375
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,400
it into lyrics and now we're going to

376
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,720
show that section and uh these measuring

377
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
numbers are the thing I was talking

378
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,280
about that I guess we have to add three

379
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,799
to each one of them to get what it is

380
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,400
eventually you know we'll be able to

381
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,400
contribute back to open source projects

382
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,320
like mcore and be able to fix this

383
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,640
limitation uh haven't had time to do

384
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,480
that yet such a great project anyhow so

385
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,360
we can go look through and see that okay

386
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,760
this time there's a lot more interesting

387
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,080
chords and some things that definitely

388
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,120
we want to reduce the vocabulary of

389
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,720
because I don't think all of those

390
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,640
chords actually say let's just grab that

391
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:26,039
last measure of the second system here

392
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:29,520
which is measure uh eight and look into

393
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:33,600
that um over here yep so there 's an a

394
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,159
sharp and then a b and a C sharp in the

395
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,080
base yep that's definitely the right

396
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,600
measure and we can see that that that

397
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,200
chord quote unquote on the second eighth

398
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,679
note is almost certainly not a chord

399
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:54,200
that is a lead a passing tone right and

400
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:56,000
so that flat augmented chord um 66 or

401
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,799
something whatever that was that's

402
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,320
something we want to reduce in the

403
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,960
vocabulary

404
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,880
so how can we do this I'm going to give

405
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,039
you one quick way that we can do this

406
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,679
let's just excert um measure 8 call it

407
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:15,640
M8 and just get that one measure from

408
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,120
the this is from the cified version uh

409
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,200
measure eight and we can just show it

410
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,760
make sure we got the right one always do

411
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,760
this by the way the number of times that

412
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,159
somebody has worked hours and hours and

413
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,480
can't figure out the bug because it

414
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,320
turns out that wasn't the right bug that

415
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,760
wasn't the right measure so yeah I'm

416
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,039
going to pause the video for one second

417
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,200
and go through those uh chords in some

418
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:42,640
detail so sorry I've cut off the soprano

419
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,200
but it's just a whole bunch of FS so we

420
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,280
can see that the first chord six I mean

421
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,200
that's really from the base that's

422
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,400
that's the chord that's happening it's

423
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,840
either the chord on beat one or the

424
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,400
chord on beat two so the third beat the

425
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,679
Baseline looks like it's doing some kind

426
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,280
of passing tone and then it's moving up

427
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:09,320
to that uh C at the end so something is

428
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,360
is happening and

429
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:16,760
but well it's really unclear if anything

430
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,120
except the first beat is something that

431
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,600
we'd want to keep as an actual chord

432
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,360
especially looking at the alto line

433
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,720
looks like it's has both of those D's

434
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,440
might be passing tones and the tenor

435
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,760
also looks like it's passing toone so a

436
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,960
lot of these cordal motions are things

437
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,320
that are introducing interesting

438
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,880
elements but aren introducing new

439
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,880
chords so what we're going to do in the

440
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,760
next section is let's just get a way of

441
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,159
saying which chords do we

442
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,360
think have the enough stability for us

443
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,280
to label them so we're going to look

444
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,039
through each chord in measure eight uh

445
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,039
in this case I don't need to do recurse

446
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,919
because measure eight only has chords

447
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,280
and time signatures maybe or something

448
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,679
like that and I'm going to print whether

449
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,440
or not the chord is consonant uh that's

450
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,240
a routine a method that's on every chord

451
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,919
object and then print the chord object

452
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,679
itself we can see that only that first

453
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,880
one six chord is actually a consonant

454
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,799
chord everything else is dissonant

455
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,720
according to the rules of total Harmony

456
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,120
so what we could do is we could create a

457
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,279
new stream and start putting all of the

458
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,919
chords in and then let's replace that

459
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:40,480
back into our uh into our original or we

460
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,480
can start copying things and putting

461
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,200
them but after thinking alloud at the

462
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,640
keyboard for a little bit I decided I

463
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,320
was going to just go through and let's

464
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,000
just remove all the chords that are not

465
00:21:50,320 --> 00:22:00,039
consonant so every stream has a nice uh

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,120
little remove uh function it from it uh

467
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,080
there there are some problems by the way

468
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,279
just like all Python and many other

469
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,120
languages uh lists and arrays and stuff

470
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,559
like that that if you remove things

471
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,279
while you're iterating over there could

472
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,679
be problems but here it's okay so we're

473
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,400
going to remove every chord that's not

474
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,120
consonant and then we're going to get

475
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,240
that first chord uh the one six chord

476
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,559
and we'll make the duration of that be a

477
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,279
whole note so now when we look at

478
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,480
measure 8 we see only that consonant

479
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,760
chord t

480
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,440
and that's one of the forms of

481
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,760
vocabulary reduction that's going to be

482
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,200
pretty

483
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,279
common so when we go back and look at

484
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:48,279
the excert here uh for the first part we

485
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,559
don't have nearly as much to remove so

486
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,200
maybe we want to do the same type of

487
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,480
thing well let's let's just look at that

488
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,320
first excerpt and see what things are

489
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,039
consonant what things are dissonant and

490
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,640
uh

491
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,320
here we do need the recurse so we're

492
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
going to look at this first excerpt and

493
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,159
see wow almost everything here is

494
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,559
consonant there's that one false which

495
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,919
one do it refer to what's it refer to oh

496
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,679
let's just replace it and print the

497
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,760
figure instead uh not the figure the

498
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,960
lyrics instead and see that that one

499
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,120
thing that is not

500
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,640
consonant is a 5 seven chord something

501
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,200
that we might want to keep whereas the

502
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,200
something else that is consonant is a 36

503
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,480
chord

504
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,120
which uh we might want to remove and say

505
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,799
well that's not a real chord in this

506
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
case it is because we're about to be

507
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:42,080
modulating into another

508
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,159
key so we're going to be thinking about

509
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,480
how can we do these things what are the

510
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,440
various criteria that we can find and

511
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,440
how do we do this
