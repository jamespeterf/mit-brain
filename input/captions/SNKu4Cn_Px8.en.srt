1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Tony Chen and I'm the CEO of

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,480
Manolan. We're a data intelligence

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,280
company that's making aquaculture or

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,840
ocean farming more predictable. I'm a

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,160
core 6 computer science alum from MIT

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
and you can see from the photos water

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,160
whether it's the pool or the Charles has

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
really been a central part of my life

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,199
since my time there. Um and at Manolin

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,680
the problem that we're focused on is how

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,680
to help aquaculture scale sustainably.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,679
So aquaculture and again that's fish

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,439
farming is the fastest growing food

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
system in the world right now. One in

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
seven people rely on fish as their

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
primary source of protein and production

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,640
needs to double reliably in the next

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
coming decades. But despite all this

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,320
importance, it's honestly the least

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,719
modern form of of industrial agriculture

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,039
or modern agriculture. There's huge gaps

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,920
in farming systems, nutrition, genetics,

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,000
biotech, and the industry still lacks a

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,840
ton of the infrastructure that crop and

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079
land farmers take for granted. Things

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,320
like commodity markets, insurance, and

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
real-time risk analytics. So, in order

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
to really scale responsibly and

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,960
efficiently, we believe that aquaculture

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,280
needs a data foundation that can make

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,680
farming more predictable and decisions

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
much more measurable. So what we've

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
built is a data platform that integrates

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
a combination of fish health and

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,560
oceanographic data. We process data

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,119
sources like satellites, ocean sensors,

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,040
machine vision cameras, and onfarmm

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,640
operational records to help our

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
customers basically make smarter

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,520
decisions. We package these insights

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,520
through two integrated platforms. On the

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,840
farming side, we have watershed and it's

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,960
our intelligence platform that helps on

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,119
providing better models to farmers. And

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
on the supplier end, we have Harpoon,

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,680
which is our supplierf facing research

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,920
and customer support platform that

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
powers large-scale observational studies

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,840
for feed, genetics, biotech, and health

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
companies. And what we're really working

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,840
on here is accelerating the feedback

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
loop between farmers and suppliers

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,479
across the industry. Behind all of this

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
is a proprietary data engine that

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,719
restructures raw farm data into the most

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,280
detailed health and performance

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,599
timelines across the industry. And what

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
it really helps us understand is what's

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,959
working and why. And here are a couple

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
example of how that translates into

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,560
actual real world impact. So one of our

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,680
customers is Veramarus. And they produce

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,480
omega-3 oils to replace fish oil in

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,120
feeds. And the goal of this is to reduce

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,040
impendence on wild capture fisheries

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
like anchovies where a ton of that fish

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,480
oil gets applied in fish field feed.

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,480
They use algae as their kind of conduit

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
for how to produce these oils. And

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
through our harpoon platform, we

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
actually conducted one of the largest

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,280
real world EPA and DHA studies ever run

73
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,360
in salmon farming. We analyzed thousands

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,840
of farming cycles to determine the

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,160
optimal levels of fatty acids that

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
maximize survival, growth, and harvest

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
quality. And in addition to the

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
sustainability importance of this

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
research, it helped Veramarus improve

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,519
their relationships with their customers

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,239
and trust the benefits of their product

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,239
even more. In another example, and this

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,640
is on the farming side, we've helped

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
Hoffsath and Cargill improve their

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,879
performance against sea lice. So sealite

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,200
is a parasite, but it's one of the most

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,239
challenging and expensive issues in

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
salmon farming. It impacts fish welfare,

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
regulatory compliance, and obviously

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
profit margins. And through our

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,519
predictive models, Hoff was able to

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,760
anticipate pressure weeks in advance of

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,440
sea lice coming to their farms and they

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,000
were able to time up treatments much

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,480
more effectively. For them, this

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,879
contributed to over $5 million in direct

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,840
revenue gains and simply they were able

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,599
to bring more fish to the market.

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,400
So for this group, we have a couple

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,840
different asks. So and we work with a

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,159
lot of different partners, but we have

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,599
three different areas. One is if you

103
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,760
provide a product, whether it's a

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,439
biological product, a feed solution, or

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,840
a health solution in another industry

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,280
that may be applicable to fish, we'd

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
love to launch some more of these

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,760
solutions to help our customers.

109
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,360
Secondary, if you guys have any sort of

110
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,360
data sets that may be helpful for our

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,439
models, we're always in the market

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
looking for ways to improve our

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,519
predictability towards our customers.

114
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,000
And then the last piece is launching

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,680
fintech or insurance solutions. We have

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,280
the data to power it. We're always

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
looking for partners who can again help

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,639
us launch some of these solutions into

119
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
the market. So if you're working in

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,360
these areas or are simply curious about

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,040
the potential, I'd love to chat. Thank

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
you guys for your time. And again, I'm

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,680
Tony.

124
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,520
>> Thank you, Tony.

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
Again, please post any questions to the

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
chat or the Q&A tab, whatever's easier.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
But let me start by asking talking about

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,360
the scaling. Um, which markets unlock

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,080
the next major phase of growth for you?

130
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah. So, in our industry, much of fish

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
farming doesn't happen in the Western

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
world or in the United States in

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
particular. We actually started with

134
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
oyster farmers and right now primarily

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
work with salmon farmers in Scandinavia.

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,440
But as far as scaling kind of towards

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,960
the rest of the world, there's there's a

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,680
couple different species that really

139
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,759
matter. One is salmon farming uh kind of

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
around the world and again, Scandinavia

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
leads in that. Um seabbass farming in

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
the Mediterranean and then shrimp

143
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,440
farming both in South America and

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
Southeast Asia. Those are kind of the

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,680
top markets for us as how we see

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,039
ourselves growing.

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,440
>> And um how do partnerships with feed

148
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,800
genetics and biotech suppliers

149
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,400
accelerate the growth compared to farm

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
only strategy?

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,560
>> No. So I mean if you imagine kind of

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,240
ocean farmers, there's millions of them.

153
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,720
A lot of small holders in shrimp in

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,560
Southeast Asia, South America. Um and

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
then the large players kind of in the

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,320
salmon industry. But suppliers, it's

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,320
what I've come to learn kind of in our

158
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,759
time in the industry are largely

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
US-based. So, a lot of the

160
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,919
pharmaceutical companies, the feed

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,320
companies, the uh some of the companies

162
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,240
that I listed on our slide decks, um

163
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,800
they're the ones that that operate kind

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,880
of as suppliers around the entire world.

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
So, those partners really can help us

166
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,120
get into a lot of those markets. um the

167
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,880
same kind of chemical manufacturers that

168
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,960
work in animal feed are the same ones

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,199
that are working in fish feed and

170
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
they're really kind of conduits for how

171
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,759
we expand around the world is through a

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,479
lot of these partnerships.

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,280
>> Great. And just to also touch on other

174
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,960
sectors, how um do you see new uh the

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,759
model evolving with new capabilities

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,240
touching on finance, insurance, risk,

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,720
all of that? Yeah, I mean in our heads

178
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
this is this is just it's a natural

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
progression for the industry right now.

180
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
The industry is just growing very

181
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
quickly and we don't pay attention to it

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,240
much because it's largely volumes are

183
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,319
coming you know from internal not export

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
markets and third world countries is is

185
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
where a lot of this is happening but we
