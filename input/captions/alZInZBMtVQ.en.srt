1
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:27,960
You live in my dreams, you're beautiful, you

2
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,960
shook me and left, you wait for me, wait for me, I'll pray for you, you

3
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,679

4
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,960
 

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,920
move me, your meaning can

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,760
exist in our language,

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:51,600
open up time, if you can, then yes, if you have the heart, I'll

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,600
draw you out.

[music]

11
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,560
Little kid, don't touch the ground,

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,040
 

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,000
you're

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,000
really out of it.

15
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:36,720

16
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:39,840
I believe that the faith and prayers of your heart are what make your prayers come alive. I have

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,240
never doubted my faith. I am thirsty and

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,640
cold. This is

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,479
my movement. Your meaning.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:56,759

21
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,290
Open the time where only we can exist. If I can do that, then yes, I will

22
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,409
draw myself.

23
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,409
[Music]

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:13,270
For you

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:16,379
[Music]

26
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,379
[Applause]

27
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,120
The book will give you a rough idea,

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,519
but it will

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,519
really give you the book in front of you

30
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,519
.   I'm

31
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,640

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,560
looking for you every time from January to December.  If we truly match, not for money,

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,599
our 13th month will be fulfilled and we will come together in four

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,599
seasons. I

35
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,599
can't do it, so I miss you. Spring has come and your eyes have become snow. We have made

36
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,040
each other feel touched.

37
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,040

[music]

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,550
[music] It's hard to

40
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,879
give up on the baby.

41
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:27,400
How can you give up your mistake there?

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,400

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,680
