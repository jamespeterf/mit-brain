1
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,199
Okay. Well, today is our our last day

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
together. I was remembering the first

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
day at the beginning. I said to

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,760
everybody, you know, I'm excited about

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,359
projection theory and these like basic

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,680
problems were just solved in the last

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,240
couple years and we're trying to, you

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,400
know, describe the ideas in this and and

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,920
the beginning of the class, you know, I

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
say all these things I'm excited to do

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,040
and I wonder, you know, am I going to

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,280
are we going to manage to do this? Uh

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,680
and uh yeah, anyway, now it's at the end

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
and we've been working steadily and done

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,200
some of it.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,559
Um

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,239
yeah. Okay.

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,480
Um yeah. So today we'll try to say um

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,280
the finish the story of proving the

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,160
sharp projection theorems and uh to say

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,359
the last couple of of ideas that go into

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,320
it. Um

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
so the first idea kind of goes back to

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,200
the beginning of the class. that goes

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,240
back to uh using the the forier method

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,720
and getting a little bit more out of it

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,880
than um than we had realized at that

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,320
time. Um and uh and then after that so

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
this this thing I'll do sort of by

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,960
itself. It's like re remembering the 4A

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
method and and playing seeing what how

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,400
much we can learn from it. Then I'll

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,840
remember what was the whole big theorem

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,479
that we wanted to prove and what are all

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,400
the things we knew about it. The last

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,640
the last idea in the class is um uh

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,960
combining combining information from

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,520
many different scales which allows us to

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,560
combine all of the previous ideas into

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
into one um big argument master

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,000
argument.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,479
Um yeah and you know this this way of

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,799
combining scales has only been I would

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,280
say has only been around for five years

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,360
or so and and is also something it's

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
it's not that complicated and it's al I

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,800
think also something you know that might

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,200
be of value to take with you away from

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,200
the class.

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Okay.

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,000
All right. So, part one is the well

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,720
spaced case

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,720
and the for method.

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
Okay.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
Um

56
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
so so all of these things that were

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,440
these sharp projection theorems there's

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,640
some kind of um uh geometric measure

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,319
theory analog of the sum troder theorem.

60
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,440
So for reference let's remember first

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,440
the saretti troder theorem

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
and uh here's the version of it that

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:06,120
will be relevant for us. So if E

64
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,120
contained in R2 is a set of end points

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:17,200
and L sub R of E is the set of lines

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,519
little L so that little L intersect E is

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
at least R.

68
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,400
Uh then the question is how big could

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,120
this be in terms of N and R. And the

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:32,080
conclusion is that the size LR of E is

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,879
bounded by N2.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,440
Actually, let me do a big R to match

73
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,440
some other notation.

74
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:48,159
N2 / R cubed + N / R.

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,720
This n^2 r cubed is comes from the grid

76
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,680
example. And this n / r comes from a

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,680
very simple example. You just draw a few

78
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,680
lines and you put R points on each of

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,680
them.

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,720
Okay. And we're trying to investigate to

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,840
what extent this continues to hold if we

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,159
replace our our pure points by some

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,239
little balls and by our pure lines by

84
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,919
some thin toes. Um and here is one clean

85
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,519
version of that that if the points are

86
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,840
quite spread out, they're what's called

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:27,160
well spaced. um then this holds almost

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,160
as real.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,919
So this is a theorem of Hong Guang nom

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,320
Solomon and and me from around 2018 or

91
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:44,000
something.

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,560
So E contained in R2 is a set of N delta

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
balls.

94
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,639
Uh E is contained in the unit of ball.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Okay. And they're well spaced. They're

96
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,280
as spread out as possible. So they obey

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,919
the condition that if you take E and you

98
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,040
intersect it with a ball of radius N to

99
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,199
the minus a half, then that's at most

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,720
around one.

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:15,759
So in other words, if I take a unit

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,160
square and I subdivide it

103
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
into squares of side length n to the

104
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,039
minus a half that's been chosen so that

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
there are n squares in this picture and

106
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,960
then I put one or roughly one point in

107
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,160
each of these squares

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,080
uh one delta ball then this is what this

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
is our

110
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,479
what our set looks like. So this is a

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,039
well spaced set.

112
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
>> Yeah.

113
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,520
>> For the size of E intersect B, is that

114
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
supposed to be a delta ball covering

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
number?

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
>> Yeah, let's make that. Yeah, that's

117
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,400
right. That's it's a Thank you. That's a

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,280
delta ball covering number.

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Okay.

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,600
All right. And then there's one more

121
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,440
hypothesis which is Okay. Okay. So yeah,

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,680
so then we could say what tr

123
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:10,319
of E is the set of delta tubes

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:14,000
T so that T intersect E delta is at

125
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,759
least R. Um and here you know if you

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,919
take a if you take such a delta tube and

127
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,600
you wiggle it imperceptibly you will

128
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,440
have another such delta tube and we want

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,520
to count those as being the same. So

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,520
I'll put here essentially distinct

131
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,400
Okay. Now, there's one other hypothesis

132
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
which is that R is not too small, which

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,600
I'll explain in a minute. The hypothesis

134
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,919
says R is at least a little bit bigger

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,720
than delta time E delta.

136
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:51,680
And then the conclusion is almost the

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:57,120
same as before that tr of e is less sim

138
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,599
sim um n^2 / r cub.

139
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,160
This two tildas here means that it's

140
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,639
hiding something like a uh like a delta

141
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,720
to the epsilon or something like that.

142
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,199
But it looks almost the same as this.

143
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
Okay, let's compare these two theorems.

144
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,319
Um, one difference is that in the first

145
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
theorem we had an extra term here which

146
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,840
I had not written in the second theorem

147
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,000
and the reason is that this this second

148
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,319
term is relevant when r is bigger than

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
the square root of n.

150
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,520
So the second term

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,520
this um dominates

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,599
if and only if r is bigger than square

153
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,759
root of n. But in the wellspaced case,

154
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
it's not possible for a tube to have

155
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
more than square root of n points on it.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,360
So this case never arises.

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
Okay. So that's why we don't have that.

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
Um the other difference is that we added

159
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,759
this lower bound on R. So let me explain

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,400
why we did that.

161
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,240
So a remark

162
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,879
um an average

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,960
for a

164
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,759
random delta tube t

165
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:18,720
the expected size of t intersect e to

166
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,440
cover. Um that would be delta time e

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
delta. This is for each of these delta

168
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,199
point each of these little delta balls.

169
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
There are this many of them. um the

170
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,960
probability that a random delta tube

171
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,960
intersects that point is about delta.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,680
Okay? So if you just take any old tube,

173
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,320
you'll have that many uh you'll hit that

174
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
many delta balls from E. Tubes that hit

175
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,760
this many delta balls of E are not

176
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,839
special. Any old tube will do. And so if

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600
R takes that value, this upper bound

178
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,880
isn't true at all. This could be way

179
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,320
bigger than that because it could be it

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,320
could be basically all the tubes. But

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,720
rather remark there's there's a rather

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,360
remarkably sharp phase transition that

183
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,760
you increase r just a little bit beyond

184
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,040
this threshold and then you get a bound

185
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,040
that matches some tri.

186
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Okay. So that is the statement of the

187
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,200
theorem. Um and it it says in a nutshell

188
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,000
that seated troder basically continues

189
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,600
to hold if you take a well spaced set E

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,920
which is one of the cases we mentioned

191
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,920
last time.

192
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay. Any questions or comments about

193
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,600
the statement?

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,720
So I am going to do a proof sketch of

195
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,720
this theorem.

196
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,000
So let me first mention the tools that

197
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,480
will go into it. There's the forier

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,640
method.

199
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,640
There's double counting. And then

200
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,200
there's I guess I'll call this playing

201
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,200
with different scales.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,760
The theme of this last class is playing

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,560
with different scales which is a simple

204
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,040
sounding an old idea which nevertheless

205
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,360
people recently have found a lot of new

206
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,480
um new ways of doing it.

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,880
Okay. Um

208
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,160
all right. So let me start with the

209
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,519
forier method.

210
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,519
Let me label this list of hypotheses

211
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,519
hypothesis

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,760
um

213
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,519
for method. Okay, so it's been a while.

214
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,519
In lectures three and four of this

215
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,640
class, we developed a forier analytic

216
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,480
method to estimate stuff like this. And

217
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
um if we had kept having problem sets

218
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,160
and if I had been really clever, I would

219
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
have had you remember it on the last

220
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,560
problem set getting ready for this

221
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,480
lecture. Um anyway, if you if you if you

222
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
take the method exactly the way we did

223
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
it back at the beginning of the class,

224
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
it said it it will say that if we have

225
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,640
the hypothesis,

226
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:27,040
then the size of TR of E

227
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:32,440
uh will bounded by delta.

228
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,440
Uh okay, I have to actually check

229
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:45,120
Okay. Delta inverse

230
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:48,240
E delta R to the minus 2.

231
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,000
I considered sort of redoing this for in

232
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
the last class to remind us all because

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,640
I don't expect it really to have it on

234
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,640
the tip of your brain. Um, but I decided

235
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,200
it was not that much fun for a thing to

236
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,880
do in the last class and also that I had

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,959
to manage the time to explain the other

238
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,360
stuff. So, I'd like to take this as a

239
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,800
black box that it's the sort of it's

240
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,760
something you can do with the tools that

241
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,760
we've already have.

242
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,959
Okay.

243
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
Um,

244
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,000
now how does this compare to our goal?

245
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:30,240
This e delta by the way is n. So this is

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,800
delta inverse n rus 2. Um

247
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,279
well it depends on how delta and n and r

248
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,160
are related to each other. But there's a

249
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,800
particular case where it just gives

250
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,160
exactly the right thing.

251
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,160
Um the particular case

252
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,519
is that if r is um the smallest that

253
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,800
it's allowed to be. So let's say it is

254
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,800
delta to the minus epsilon delta e

255
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
delta.

256
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,160
Okay. So in this case if I solve for the

257
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,160
delta inverse the delta inverse would be

258
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:19,040
around n / r

259
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:24,160
and then I plug in here um and I get

260
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:29,720
that one that this is an n / r is n^2 r

261
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,720
cub that's the semi of that.

262
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,720
So this 4A method actually gives the

263
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,720
right answer in an interesting case.

264
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,839
But then if you make r bigger

265
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:53,360
um then if you do this computation um

266
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:58,279
this ends up being bigger and and this

267
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,279
this will be bigger than n^2 r cubed.

268
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,680
Okay.

269
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,959
You know another interesting basic thing

270
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:13,199
about this that is perhaps surprising is

271
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:17,040
that as delta if delta gets bigger the

272
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,680
right hand side gets smaller.

273
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,199
So as we make our tubes thicker we

274
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,199
actually get a better bout.

275
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
Um okay

276
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,720
so

277
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
um if r is bigger this is the smallest r

278
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,800
could be. So the other option is that r

279
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,480
is bigger than this. So delta to the

280
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,680
minus epsilon delta e delta is less than

281
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
r. And let's say that r is less than the

282
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,440
square root of n because as we mentioned

283
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,240
earlier if r can't be any bigger than

284
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:56,560
the square root of n. Okay. Then

285
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm going to set a scale row

286
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:04,399
so that

287
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,399
row * n is around r.

288
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,360
row * n is around r.

289
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,720
So how big is row? Um well row is going

290
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,920
to be r / n. So it will be smaller than

291
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,480
n to the minus a half but it will be

292
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,440
bigger than delta because um

293
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,839
delta n was smaller than r and I'm going

294
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,480
to increase delta to row so that row n

295
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,760
will be around r. So row will be around

296
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:46,240
there. And then we're going to study

297
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:49,560
E row which is the row neighborhood

298
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,560
of E.

299
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,759
So let's make a picture.

300
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Here is the picture of our wellspace set

301
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,160
E. And then we're going to have a scale

302
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,759
row which is smaller than this scale n

303
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,759
to the minus a half but bigger than

304
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,759
delta. And we'll look at

305
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,759
that guy row.

306
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,519
Um

307
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,519
and you know originally we're trying to

308
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,519
find

309
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,279
our original problem is to understand

310
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,279
delta tubes that hit a lot of balls.

311
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,279
So

312
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,880
this might be one.

313
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,560
This is a tube delta tube and tr delta.

314
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,519
E Delta is just E, but I put the delta

315
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,320
to remind us. Um, but now that we have

316
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,320
these thicker guys, we could study um

317
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,920
I could study a row tube

318
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,880
that contains a lot of row balls.

319
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:08,720
So this might be T row. That might be a

320
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,520
tube that that intersects row a lot. Um

321
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,959
and well maybe for the same R but also

322
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,959
maybe for different RS we might be

323
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,959
interested.

324
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,360
So now let's make a definition. Uh

325
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:30,799
so TR

326
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:33,280
of TR tilda of E row this is the set of

327
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,640
row tubes

328
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,880
T row. So that if I take T row

329
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,679
intersected with E row and I take its

330
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,679
row covering number, that's at least our

331
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,679
tilt.

332
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Okay. And now the same argument as

333
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,720
before gives us a bound for this thing.

334
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:01,120
So if we have our hypothesis

335
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,360
and if our tilda um

336
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,360
let's see

337
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,720
well let me not keep track of it. If we

338
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,960
have our hypothesis and arch tilda is

339
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,960
big enough

340
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
um

341
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,720
then yeah I'll just yeah here we can put

342
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:29,840
r tilda is at least as big as r then

343
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:32,559
t r tilda of e row will be bounded by

344
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,400
um

345
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:44,600
well we'll have row inverse

346
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,600
* e delta * r - 2 * r tilda 2

347
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,600
and this row inverse

348
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,320
is

349
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,320
n / r.

350
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:06,880
So that's n^ 2 / r * r tilda^ 2.

351
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Just by thickening the tubes we get

352
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,840
these bounds. And let me mention an

353
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,600
important special case. So eg

354
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:22,440
tr

355
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,440
of e row is bounded by n^2 r cubed.

356
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
All

357
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,559
right.

358
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,400
So, as it's it's uh

359
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,720
it's a surprising thing that as we

360
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,000
increase row, we get a better and better

361
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,000
upper bound for this.

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,919
Um now we can't increase it. There's a

363
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,679
limit to how much we can increase it

364
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:05,640
because we do need

365
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,640
we do need this condition.

366
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,440
So row this this gives some upper bound

367
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,280
for row.

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
But taking row as close as you can to

369
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,840
that upper bound is a good idea. And

370
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,160
when we when we make row that big then

371
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,160
we get this.

372
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:33,919
Okay. Now have we proven the theorem

373
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,600
it look so when I got Yeah. Alia.

374
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,159
>> Yeah it's a good question about the

375
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,960
bound theorem you apply uh the same for

376
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:45,840
method.

377
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,280
>> Yes. Um but um would the E delta stay

378
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,039
not becoming?

379
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,200
>> Uh right. Right. So it would be E row.

380
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,919
Um but

381
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,480
you can um you can maybe see from the

382
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:05,600
picture where did we introduce E row?

383
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,360
So E row is equal to E delta is equal

384
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,799
to.

385
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,880
But that's a special that's where we're

386
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,440
using that our set is well spaced,

387
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,520
right? So that's a great thing to um

388
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,039
yeah so the qu so the question was you

389
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,880
know should this should be a row instead

390
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,880
of a delta and how does that affect

391
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,480
things and the answer is yeah great

392
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,760
point this should be a row instead of a

393
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,280
delta but for our set it doesn't change

394
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,760
anything

395
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,159
and

396
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,440
um so if you look at our set our set has

397
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,679
only one delta ball in each um n to the

398
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,559
minus a half ball. So when you thicken

399
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,400
them a little bit, the number of balls

400
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,880
you see is doesn't change. It's still n.

401
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,880
So that is where we are using this

402
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,880
hypothesis.

403
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,119
[Applause]

404
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,880
Yeah, great point.

405
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,360
Okay,

406
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
so when I first saw this, I thought that

407
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,840
we were done.

408
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,760
Um, but it's not quite true. So, uh, our

409
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,720
conclusion in the theorem is that we're

410
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,039
going to try to to estimate

411
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,000
how many of these guys there are thin

412
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,679
tubes, delta tubes that have R balls in

413
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,919
them.

414
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:30,240
And, um, we've counted the number of

415
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,799
thick tubes that have R balls in them.

416
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Now, every thin tube with RB balls, if

417
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,360
you thicken it, you get a thick tube

418
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,320
with at least R balls. But inside of a

419
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,080
thick tube with R balls,

420
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,080
there may be many thin tubes with RB

421
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,280
balls. And we've only counted them once.

422
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,960
So, we do we still have an issue.

423
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,919
Doesn't got super difficult, but it's

424
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,919
important to recognize it.

425
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,640
So

426
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,400
issue

427
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,960
one row tube

428
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,960
may contain

429
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,280
many tubes

430
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,799
of

431
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,039
TR delta.

432
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,880
So what would the bad scenario look

433
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,039
like?

434
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,760
We would have

435
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,880
like a row tube here

436
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,080
and inside we would have a bunch of

437
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,200
delta balls. So at least r of them but

438
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:40,000
maybe more than r of them.

439
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,919
So let's say that t row intersected with

440
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,960
e.

441
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,760
So delta that would be the same as t row

442
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,120
intersected with e row. um let's say

443
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,520
that it's r tilda which is at least

444
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,880
small might be r but it might also be

445
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:00,400
bigger and then um inside of here we may

446
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,200
have

447
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,200
many delta tubes

448
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,440
that each contain

449
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,440
each contains

450
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,240
Okay.

451
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
So,

452
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,200
so now we have some cousin of our

453
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,360
original problem. We have R tilda delta

454
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,559
balls and we want to count how many RI

455
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,200
tubes there are. Um, we don't know as

456
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
much about how they are spaced, but also

457
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,440
we don't need to have such an incredible

458
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,440
bound. Um so

459
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,360
so uh by induction

460
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,279
we can assume

461
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,279
or we can reduce to the case

462
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:12,240
that each uh t and tr of e delta

463
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:15,720
um has many delta balls

464
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,720
at both ends.

465
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,880
Right?

466
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,840
So

467
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,679
what I mean by that is here's a tube

468
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,120
delta tube. It has a bunch of delta

469
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,039
balls in it. So it means

470
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,039
that there are a bunch at one end and a

471
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,320
bunch at the other end. Maybe also a

472
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:42,360
bunch at the middle. Um, uh, maybe it's

473
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,360
better to draw what it's not.

474
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,880
What it's not is like they're just all

475
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,880
on the left.

476
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,720
Okay. So, in a nutshell, how would we do

477
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,559
this if this was the situation

478
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,200
that all of the delta balls were

479
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,559
actually in a much shorter tube? Well,

480
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,039
then in my original picture,

481
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,559
I could cut my set E into separate

482
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,159
pieces and just look at um RIT tubes on

483
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,159
each of those pieces and I could do some

484
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,159
induction.

485
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,840
Um so then we do a double counting

486
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
argument.

487
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,640
I'm gonna do um

488
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,039
so we're going to count um just pairs of

489
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,480
delta balls.

490
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,480
Uh so I'll have like

491
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,480
um

492
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,440
tr of e delta

493
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,520
intersect tubes in t row.

494
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,360
So the number of yellow tubes in this

495
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,720
picture times r 2. So I take a tube and

496
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,000
I pick two points in the tube kind of

497
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,480
near opposite ends

498
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,039
and for any two points there is only one

499
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,840
tube that joins them. So this should be

500
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:15,240
bounded by r tilda squ

501
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,240
double count.

502
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:28,679
So we're counting we're counting pairs t

503
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,679
uh x1 x2

504
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:37,679
where

505
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,679
t is in this set and x1 and x2 are in t

506
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,679
and they're near opposite ends.

507
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,679
So how many are there? Well, for each

508
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,919
tube there are R 2 choices of X1 and X2.

509
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,080
On the other hand,

510
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,480
there are only R tilda squared choices

511
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,720
for X1 and X2.

512
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:06,679
And for each X1 and X2, there's only one

513
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,679
choice of T. So this is bounded by this.

514
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,559
Okay. So to double counting and the 4A

515
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
method are the two foundational

516
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,840
approaches that we did at the beginning

517
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,240
of the class. This one was short enough

518
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,480
that I thought I could I could recall it

519
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,480
for us.

520
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,679
Okay.

521
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,120
All right. So now um

522
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:41,919
TR of E delta is bounded by

523
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:47,039
um

524
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,720
the maybe sum on R tilda bigger than R

525
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,399
diic.

526
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,320
We're going to look at TR tilda of E

527
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,480
row,

528
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,760
but then we're going to multiply by R

529
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,760
tilda over R 2,

530
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,000
right? Why? So every RI delta tube, if

531
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,960
you thicken it up to be a row tube, it

532
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,679
will be an R tilder rich row tube and R

533
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,880
tilda will be at least R.

534
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:20,720
So they're all in here somewhere.

535
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:25,840
And um in each one of these guys there's

536
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,080
at most this many uh RI delta tubes.

537
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,880
This is bounded by this. And then if we

538
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,440
plug in our bounds everything will work.

539
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:40,640
So this is bounded by um

540
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:44,720
n^2 over r * r tilda squared. And then

541
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,840
we have r tilda^ 2 over r 2.

542
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:52,559
This just cancels

543
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:56,120
and we get n^2 r cub. And that's the end

544
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,120
of the proof sketch.

545
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,679
>> Yeah.

546
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,640
>> Where does the sum go?

547
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,120
The sum has logarithmically many terms.

548
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
>> Oh,

549
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,520
>> and so it gets absorbed.

550
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,159
Maybe I should write that. Let's write

551
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,159
that. Okay. It gets absorbed in the last

552
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,159
Simpsons.

553
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:40,399
>> Yeah. is the only part where we use it

554
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,360
is like well

555
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,600
it's like

556
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,600
the delta

557
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,159
>> yeah so the question is where did we use

558
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,799
it's well spaced and I think it's

559
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,960
instructive to trace where we used all

560
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,960
the hypothesis

561
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,039
so let's label this

562
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,039
WS. Well, let's label it well spaced,

563
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,840
which we can abbre.

564
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,840
So, where did we use that? It's well

565
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,840
spaced.

566
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:21,840
We used it here. And that's the only

567
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,840
place.

568
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,880
So, so

569
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,880
this guy is is N.

570
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:36,080
That's the only place that we use.

571
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,840
Okay. If I had another hypothesis

572
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,840
um hypothesis that R is bigger than

573
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
average

574
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,840
r bigger than average um I have

575
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,760
unfortunately hidden a little bit where

576
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,399
we used that hypothesis but it it was in

577
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,480
this forier estimate.

578
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:03,279
So here we use r big

579
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,799
and perhaps a little bit we might use a

580
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,799
little bit of well space too although we

581
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,919
don't need anything as strong as what's

582
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,200
what's up there. Um where did our big

583
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,039
come in? Well we had all these tubes and

584
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,720
we took a sum of the characteristic

585
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,960
functions of the tubes smoothed out a

586
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,480
little bit and we did 4a analysis with

587
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,320
them and there was a high frequency part

588
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,000
and a low frequency part and some middle

589
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,240
frequencies.

590
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,679
Um this is the high the contribution of

591
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
the high frequency part. If the high

592
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,120
frequency part dominates immediately you

593
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,039
get this

594
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,200
the very low frequencies uh corresponds

595
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,279
if the low frequency dominated it would

596
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,399
mean that r was equal to this

597
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,919
and there are some in between

598
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,039
frequencies. So you have to compute a

599
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,000
little bit to see that they're

600
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,000
controlled by those two cases.

601
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,519
Good. Yeah,

602
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
>> I guess the A for method doesn't really

603
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,120
need the well spacing condition, but

604
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
would it be possible to use kind of well

605
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,440
spacing condition to put a cap on the

606
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:09,519
high frequency command cuz seems like if

607
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,080
the the frequencies of the corresponding

608
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:16,399
to the delta balls should be low if the

609
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,399
delta balls are very well spaced.

610
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,000
Um

611
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,480
so the question is about the

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,559
relationship between the spacing of E

613
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,559
and the frequencies in like the 4A

614
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,360
transform of E. Is that the question?

615
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,360
Yeah. Um

616
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,559
yeah. So if if you just took one uh

617
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,000
delta ball here and you smoothed out its

618
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,760
characteristic function, it would have a

619
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,320
4A transform that was supported on a

620
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
delta inverse ball.

621
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,000
Now we have a bunch of them and so each

622
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,760
of them has a 4A transform that's

623
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,159
supported on a delta inverse ball and

624
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,760
now we're going to add them all up. Um

625
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
now when we add them all up what happens

626
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,200
is complicated and it depends on exactly

627
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,039
where we put them all but absent any

628
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,360
detailed information about exactly where

629
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,200
we put them all. You would typically

630
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,039
expect that they would have maybe square

631
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,119
root cancellation and that the sum would

632
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,599
still be pretty evenly spread over a

633
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,720
delta inverse.

634
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,800
Um and um

635
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,720
um

636
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,639
yeah, so being well spaced, we would see

637
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,839
quite a lot of high frequency, but I

638
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,480
don't know that we could recognize

639
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,480
whether we were well spaced. I guess if

640
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,000
they I guess if we if we you had more

641
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,040
points closer together, you would see

642
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,040
more low frequency stuff.

643
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,000
Good. Other questions or comments?

644
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,359
Okay, I had myself a couple comments.

645
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,599
Uh, so one thing was it seemed kind of

646
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,679
magical to me that we ended up with the

647
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,599
right answer.

648
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,240
Um, and looking back

649
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,400
in in all the proofs of anything related

650
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,079
to saretti trotder, it seems rather

651
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,160
magical to me that we get the right

652
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,680
answer. So the the uh form ready troder

653
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,760
or this theorem there's a construction

654
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,280
you take a grid you take some lines at

655
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,480
rational slopes you compute a little bit

656
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,920
and you see what happens and you get

657
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,800
this n^2 r cubed then independently from

658
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,280
that you look at some cell partitions or

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,400
some this or some that or some for

660
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,000
analysis and completely unrelated

661
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,320
argument you get something and if you're

662
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
if you're lucky it's n^2 over r cubed

663
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,400
and we declare victory um and yeah in in

664
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,119
all the cases I won't really understand

665
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,520
why it why we are getting the right

666
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,440
answer

667
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,800
and it's perhaps worth mentioning that

668
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,680
summar has many cousin problems which

669
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,320
are almost as simple to state but no one

670
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,160
knows the right answer. Um so for

671
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,920
instance if you replace straight lines

672
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,280
with circles

673
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,920
or degree 2 curves or unit circles or

674
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,760
make up your favorite class of curves um

675
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,920
you get natural questions that people

676
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,640
have studied hard and almost every one

677
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,359
of them we cannot prove matching

678
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,880
examples and upper bounds.

679
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,920
So it is plausible that um

680
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,760
that there is no deep reason why this

681
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,000
bound matches the example that but that

682
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,640
we were just lucky.

683
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,640
>> Yeah.

684
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,960
>> Most kind of put other variations of the

685
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,200
problem. Is it like harder to show kind

686
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
of a similar bound or to kind of find

687
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,359
examples

688
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,280
versus different?

689
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,440
>> Um yeah. So the question is for these

690
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,920
all these other variations is it harder

691
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,200
to to prove upper bounds or harder to

692
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,920
find good examples? Um in all these

693
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,880
problems all of the known examples are

694
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,119
look a lot like the grid example there

695
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,480
they they involve grids of points and

696
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,160
you try to intersect it with a lot of

697
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,680
circles or a lot of parabas or what have

698
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,359
you. Um and um and there's some upper

699
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,880
bound and the proofs of the upper bounds

700
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,359
are not so different from the proofs

701
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,880
that we have shown but the numbers that

702
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,680
come up just they just don't match and

703
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,920
popular opinion probably is on the side

704
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,599
that the upper bound should be improved

705
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,960
but we are talking about open problems

706
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,200
so nobody knows.

707
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,160
Yeah.

708
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,160
Okay. So that's one comment. Um, another

709
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,240
comment is that in the context of the

710
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,000
fenberg problem, there was a key

711
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,839
difficulty that the first problem was

712
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,520
false over the complex numbers, the

713
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,960
first inber conjecture, but true over

714
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,640
the real numbers. So, we're always on

715
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,079
the lookout for what steps distinguish

716
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,240
the real numbers from the complex

717
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,320
numbers. This argument does not

718
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,240
distinguish them. This statement can be

719
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,800
you can replace all the Rs with C's and

720
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,560
adjust a few things and it's still true.

721
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,880
So, this part of the proof is not

722
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,160
helping with that issue.

723
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah. Cool.

724
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,000
Okay. So,

725
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
so that was part one of the class, the

726
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,079
well spaced case using the forier

727
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,960
method. Um, part two combining all the

728
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,720
stuff we've done. Um, let's start by

729
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
remembering what is the big theorem that

730
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,079
we're discussing the proof of and then

731
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,760
like sort of what are all the things

732
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,040
that we've done and the last part we'll

733
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,119
talk about how to put the pieces

734
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,119
together.

735
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,119
Okay.

736
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,219
[Applause]

737
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,160
All right. So here is the big theorem

738
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,160
that we would like to prove.

739
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:06,560
So if E is a delta T set

740
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:09,440
in the unit ball in R2

741
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,320
uh and let's say that the size of E is

742
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,079
delta to the minus T

743
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,119
and then for every point in E

744
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:23,599
um TX

745
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,599
is a delta S set of tubes.

746
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,240
through the point x and there's no loss

747
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,359
of generality in assuming that this is

748
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:38,599
delta to the minus s put them all

749
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,599
together to make a set of tubes t

750
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,119
okay and then uh

751
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,800
uh thinking about how how how these

752
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:54,160
tubes intersect e so let's say r is the

753
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,960
typical ical value of e intersect t

754
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,800
delta covering number typical over t and

755
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,640
t

756
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,839
could mean average if you like but they

757
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,599
after after a little bit of um pigeon

758
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,200
holing we can assume that they're all

759
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:13,359
about the same as each other

760
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,599
okay so then

761
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,920
uh the goal is to say that r is not too

762
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,119
big these tubes can't overlap the points

763
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,800
too much r is bounded by the maximum of

764
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,800
three things corresponding to three

765
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,800
scenarios.

766
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,160
Okay, so A is the stars example.

767
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,240
These tubes have nothing to do with each

768
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,280
other. So the number of of dots on each

769
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,119
tube is just one. That's scenario A. B

770
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,240
is the really interesting one. It's the

771
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,440
integer grid and so this we've written

772
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,280
things a little differently but this

773
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,760
corresponds to the numerology in sem

774
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,960
ready try

775
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,200
um and C is uh the regime where uh uh

776
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,119
random tubes

777
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,280
know if this set E is really large a

778
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,000
random tube will hit a lot of points of

779
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,800
E and this set T certainly could be made

780
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,839
out of random tubes

781
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,160
okay so that is the theorem we're trying

782
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,160
to prove

783
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,839
And we have developed uh many techniques

784
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,400
and tools to work on this theorem and we

785
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,800
have proven many cases of it. And let's

786
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,050
uh document that

787
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,050
[Applause]

788
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,599
Okay. So cases

789
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,560
we have

790
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,560
uh discussed the proof.

791
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,319
Okay. So there are these A, B and C

792
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,920
scenarios and so we should sort of sort

793
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:22,520
this theorem according to who is bigger

794
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,520
A or B or C. So uh A dominates

795
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,800
that if and only if

796
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,079
uh S is greater than or equal to T. Let

797
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,079
me write it actually as t is less well s

798
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,680
is greater than

799
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:41,400
um and in this case it's true by a

800
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,400
double counting argument

801
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,280
and c dominates

802
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,920
if and only if s + t is greater than or

803
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,400
equal to 2 and that's also true by the

804
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,400
forier method.

805
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,040
Okay,

806
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,680
so B dominates

807
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,079
otherwise and it's actually important to

808
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,839
write down this otherwise. So S is

809
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,839
between T is between S and 2 minus S.

810
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,400
Okay, that's what's left. And this one

811
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,400
we don't know yet.

812
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:30,079
But we do know a couple of special cases

813
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,280
of this hard case. Um but we do know

814
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,760
um do know

815
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,160
if E is ad regular

816
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,240
that was by orin we talked about it last

817
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,839
time and we do know

818
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:53,800
sorry it is true E is a regular and it

819
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,800
is true if E is well spaced

820
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,000
we just talked

821
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,839
And that's striking because ad regular

822
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,680
and well spaced are sort of the two

823
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,440
extremes in the way that E could be

824
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,920
spaced and the other stuff is in the

825
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,920
middle here. Um

826
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,920
now

827
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,680
yeah so actually people in the field

828
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,839
have run into this problem a number of

829
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,599
times and and and it um so there okay so

830
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:25,760
there are several cousin problems of

831
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,760
this first set problem. There's the CA

832
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,680
problem which is the most famous. Uh

833
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,640
there's also the falconer distance set

834
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,480
problem. And in both of those problems

835
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,520
there was a period where people knew how

836
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,040
to do these two extreme cases and we

837
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,400
thought we hoped maybe we were close and

838
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
we tried to do the stuff in the middle

839
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,400
and it was hard and messy and we

840
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,079
couldn't do it.

841
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,839
So when Orbin and Schmurkin wrote their

842
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,079
paper, they said, "We we've solved the

843
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,359
ad regular case and we know that

844
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,440
previously some people solved the

845
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,760
wellspaced case and what's left is to do

846
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,800
the stuff in the middle, but we're not

847
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,640
sure whether that might be very hard.

848
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,400
Okay,

849
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,720
cool. Um,

850
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,480
cool.

851
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,800
Um,

852
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,040
okay. Um and so the last the last idea

853
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,520
in the proof is an idea from Ren and

854
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,280
Wong. How to

855
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,920
um

856
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,200
break up the general case into pieces

857
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,720
that can be handled by these methods.

858
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,800
First part of what they did is they

859
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,280
souped up this well spaced case a little

860
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,760
bit. Um so they proved that it's true if

861
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:39,200
E is something called semi wellspaced

862
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:44,480
that I will define for you

863
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:48,160
def definition um soon. Okay.

864
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,359
So it's a mild generalization of this

865
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,440
and the proof is very is fairly a little

866
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,359
more complicated but it's similar ideas

867
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,599
to what I showed you. Uh it doesn't

868
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,760
distinguish R from C. It's the same

869
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,920
tools that I showed you.

870
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,520
Okay. And then the the really important

871
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,599
thing is how to how to put all these

872
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,280
things together.

873
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,200
Okay. Um so we're going to put all these

874
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,520
things together

875
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,440
by using uh a multiscale argument which

876
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,839
is similar to the sub multiplicative

877
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,359
lema that was one of the key things in

878
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,680
the in the ad regular case.

879
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,839
So let me remind you of that and draw

880
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,839
draw the important picture again. All

881
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,359
right. So

882
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,359
multi-cale

883
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,359
argument,

884
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,640
so um

885
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,800
so we're going to have delta, we're

886
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,599
going to have some scale in between

887
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,839
delta and row. And I'm going to

888
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,640
visualize E at this scale, but also at

889
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:28,200
that scale. So now we have a general E

890
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,200
but it's uniform

891
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,240
and so I think of it as having some row

892
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,800
balls.

893
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,240
So these circles

894
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,880
are row inside of each row ball we have

895
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,880
some delta balls.

896
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,319
So those are the delta balls and E

897
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,319
delta.

898
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,319
Okay.

899
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,800
And we have some fat tubes

900
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:06,800
like that. So those are the tubes that

901
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:10,560
scale row. Inside of the fat tubes, we

902
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,359
have some thin tubes. Um

903
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,359
should draw a little differently.

904
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,680
So those are the delta tubes.

905
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:40,079
Okay. Now what do we notice?

906
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:45,680
We notice that the r that's associated

907
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:48,720
to e delta and t delta can be bounded

908
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,359
by a coarse scale. So this r is how many

909
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,880
delta balls are there in an orange tube

910
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:59,200
like this. So first we can ask how many

911
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:05,359
row balls uh does the orange tube hit.

912
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:07,440
So that would be r of e row t row.

913
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,240
And then we look inside each of those

914
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,920
row balls at this short delta tube and

915
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,800
we ask how many delta balls does it hit.

916
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,160
And let's call one of these balls B the

917
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,920
typical row ball. And that would be R of

918
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,480
EB

919
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:29,920
TB.

920
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:33,760
Okay. Who are what is EB TB? Um so EB is

921
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,880
just E intersect B. And then let's

922
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,720
rescale it so that B becomes a unit

923
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,400
ball.

924
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:49,119
And TB is you take T well you take T

925
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,960
intersect B where T is in T. You take

926
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,280
all these little pieces of tubes and

927
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,920
then again you rescale

928
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:03,760
so that B becomes the unit ball. And so

929
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:09,440
EB is a set of delta over row balls

930
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:11,599
and TB is a set of delta over row tubes.

931
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,680
We do this rescaling. So we can relate

932
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,720
this. Think of this as a case of our

933
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:19,520
original problem. We can use induction.

934
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,200
Um okay. But this inequality is just how

935
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,440
many delta balls are there in the orange

936
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,760
tube? Well, how many row balls does it

937
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,920
hit and how many delta balls are in each

938
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,920
row ball?

939
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,319
Okay, cool. So,

940
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,319
by this multiscale argument, we can take

941
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,559
our original problem and break it up

942
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,800
into pieces. We get to choose row. So,

943
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,400
we have some flexibility there. Then we

944
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,119
can repeat that. We can break these up

945
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,400
into pieces and so on. And we would be

946
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,640
very happy if all of these pieces

947
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,400
are in the list of things that we

948
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,400
understand.

949
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,480
And then we could multiply go together

950
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,000
all those bounds and get a bound. And in

951
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,000
some cases we'll get the sharp bound.

952
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,559
And and then that's how we that's how

953
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,559
they prove the theorem.

954
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,079
Okay.

955
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,839
Now to keep track of what happens

956
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,960
everything is described in terms of the

957
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,720
branching function. And for people's

958
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,400
intuition, it has been very helpful to

959
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,880
draw pictures of the graph of the

960
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,880
branching function.

961
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,640
Okay. do graph

962
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,640
of the branching function.

963
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,480
So we're going to suppose that E is

964
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,319
uniform

965
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,640
and then I'm going to draw a graph that

966
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,640
encodes the information of how many row

967
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,480
balls there are to cover E at every

968
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:04,800
scale. So on this axis I want to put row

969
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,960
and what I'm going to put is log delta

970
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,160
of row. So it's going to be a number

971
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,160
between zero and one.

972
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,480
And now on this axis I want to

973
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,920
understand the covering number row. And

974
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,040
I what I'm going to put here is the

975
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,079
logarithm in the base 1 / delta of this

976
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,319
covering number.

977
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:29,680
Okay.

978
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:32,160
Um so

979
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,559
uh if

980
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,640
e delta were a delta to the minus t

981
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,559
then when you plug in one here that

982
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,400
corresponds to the scale delta. So this

983
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,119
is delta to the minus t. So this

984
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,119
logarithm would be t

985
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,359
have this. So I'm going to call this

986
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,880
variable t. U I'm going to call this

987
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:55,119
variable x and this is f ofx. f is the

988
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,079
branching function.

989
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:03,240
So if e of e delta is delta to the minus

990
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,240
t it means f of 1 equals t.

991
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:14,720
If e is a deltat t set

992
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,720
then it means that f ofx is bigger than

993
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:22,119
t * x. So here's the straight line with

994
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,119
slope t

995
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,760
and

996
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:30,559
I'll put this in blue. f ofx is bigger

997
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:33,040
than t * x. Okay, there are many things

998
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,040
that we could draw that do that be like

999
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,040
that.

1000
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,319
Okay,

1001
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,960
so these pictures always start at one

1002
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,520
because when x is one, it means we're

1003
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,160
talking about the scale row equals 1.

1004
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,559
And this is a subset of the unit ball.

1005
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:01,800
So that's the covering number at scale

1006
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,800
one is one. So it always starts there.

1007
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,319
any questions or comments about the

1008
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,319
about these setting this up as a graph?

1009
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,359
Okay, so now what do we know about this

1010
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:23,400
function f? Um

1011
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:23,400
so f is monotonically increasing.

1012
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,480
Why? Um as we go this way, row is

1013
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,680
getting smaller and the row covering

1014
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,839
number is only going to get bigger.

1015
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:41,680
but it doesn't increase too quickly. Um,

1016
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:45,200
so f ofx f(x) plus delta x is less than

1017
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:48,400
or equal to f ofx + 2 delta x. So f is

1018
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:52,400
two vectors.

1019
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,520
Uh why? Well, if we have a a row ball

1020
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,800
and then we decrease row, we can always

1021
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,800
cover that with a certain number of rota

1022
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,079
balls.

1023
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:09,119
So B row is covered

1024
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:11,920
by row tilda row over. So if row tilda

1025
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:18,480
is less than row then B row is covered

1026
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:20,480
by row over row tilda squared row tilda

1027
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,000
and we may or may not need all of them

1028
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,680
but the most we could need is all of

1029
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,480
them and that would correspond to

1030
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:30,280
equality here.

1031
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,280
So f is two lips.

1032
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,200
>> Yeah.

1033
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,680
>> So the two comes from the dimension.

1034
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,599
>> Two comes from the dimension. This two

1035
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,280
is this two which comes from the

1036
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,240
dimension. Yeah. Okay. That's right. So

1037
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,200
let me say E is uniform. E is contained

1038
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,280
in the unit ball and E is in two

1039
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,119
dimensions. And if you change this two

1040
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,720
to a D dimension, the only thing in this

1041
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,520
discussion that would change is that

1042
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,520
these twos would become D's. Yeah. Thank

1043
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,520
you.

1044
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:04,240
Yeah, good.

1045
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:08,799
Okay. So, um to get a feel for this, I

1046
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,799
will draw a few pictures of um

1047
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:14,160
uh of the branching functions for cases

1048
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:20,440
that we have considered.

1049
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,440
Okay. So for the ad regular set

1050
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,760
before I draw it, picture in your mind's

1051
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,920
eye what does the branching function

1052
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,920
look like.

1053
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,280
It is a straight line.

1054
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,839
Okay. the well spaced example.

1055
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,260
[Applause]

1056
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,400
So the wellspaced example

1057
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,480
looks like this. It's a straight line of

1058
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:08,319
slope 2

1059
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,319
up to the height t and then it's a

1060
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:13,319
horizontal line. It's flatline after

1061
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,319
that.

1062
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,480
Okay. And now I can tell you what is the

1063
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:26,680
semi wellspace set.

1064
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,680
So here's what we do.

1065
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,160
So semi wellspace definition is now so t

1066
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,760
is going to be in between 2 minus s and

1067
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,839
s. That's good. That's the region we

1068
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,520
don't already understand.

1069
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:44,400
Um so e delta is going to be delta to

1070
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,720
the minus t. So that point there is

1071
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,640
going to be on our branching function.

1072
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:55,359
And then what I will do is I draw here a

1073
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:59,599
line with slope s and here a line with

1074
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:01,599
slope 2 minus s. By the way s is between

1075
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,720
zero and one. So 2 - s is the bigger

1076
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:08,480
one. And I extend these lines until they

1077
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,480
meet. They'll meet somewhere.

1078
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,480
Um, okay. And then the branching

1079
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:19,680
function

1080
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:22,079
f ofx has to lie above this stuff and it

1081
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:25,799
has to go there. That's the definition

1082
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,799
of semi well spaced.

1083
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,720
Um, okay. So, so Ren and Wong, they

1084
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,240
proved that in the semi-wwell spaced

1085
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,359
case the this theorem is true.

1086
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,200
Um and we won't do the whole proof but

1087
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:43,440
you know the proof is a variant on what

1088
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,160
we saw here where you combine in a

1089
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,400
clever way the forier method and the

1090
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,880
double counting method.

1091
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,920
And at a very high level you know this

1092
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,640
setup is sort of this slope 2 minus s is

1093
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,640
the slope where the forier method works

1094
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,119
and this slope s is the slope where the

1095
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,280
double counting method works.

1096
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,799
And so this picture turns out to be the

1097
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,040
situation where you can combine those

1098
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:11,839
two methods. Well,

1099
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:15,040
okay.

1100
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,720
All right. So now let's think about what

1101
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,880
happens when we do this multiscale

1102
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,760
argument. What happens to the branching

1103
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,200
functions? In other words, I start with

1104
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,960
this setup. I want to understand this

1105
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,440
guy and and it depends on the branching

1106
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,000
function of E delta. And I get these two

1107
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,920
new sort of smaller problems. What is

1108
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,880
the relationship between this branching

1109
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,119
function and these branching functions?

1110
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,119
Okay, the relationship is really u

1111
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,119
simple.

1112
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,040
So,

1113
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:01,680
so this is so f ofx itself this is the

1114
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,559
branching function of e delta and it

1115
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,119
looks like something

1116
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,520
okay could be anything

1117
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:13,839
and then we have this scale row. So over

1118
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:17,520
here is log delta of row.

1119
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:21,839
And if you think about this set e row,

1120
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:23,280
well it's just the branching function of

1121
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:25,040
e row is the same as the branching

1122
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,720
function of e delta except it just stops

1123
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,240
at row and we don't look at any smaller

1124
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,240
scales.

1125
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,240
So,

1126
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:40,640
so this here in orange is basically the

1127
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:43,880
branching function of row.

1128
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,880
And then

1129
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,040
then we look inside of this ball

1130
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,640
and we look at all of the start at the

1131
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,359
scale row and then we look at all of the

1132
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:59,359
smaller scales of E. So um this thing

1133
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:04,799
here

1134
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:06,480
is um let me say this describes

1135
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,079
f.

1136
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,240
This is basically the branching function

1137
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,240
of EB.

1138
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:22,400
Okay. Okay. Great. So

1139
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,440
so what's the situation?

1140
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,400
we begin with an arbitrary branching

1141
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,000
function that just obeys this condition.

1142
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,000
Uh yeah

1143
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,920
>> going back to the the uh multi scale or

1144
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,119
the simplicity

1145
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,480
second why why is it like the second one

1146
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:46,640
like RB TB but it's like the number of

1147
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,319
delta balls in the ball like how

1148
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,359
misunderstanding

1149
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:54,000
>> right right so

1150
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:57,040
this r of eBT

1151
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,200
is supposed to be counting the number of

1152
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:03,520
delta balls in in a segment like that.

1153
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,520
Okay. Now, why is it counting that? Who

1154
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,640
is EB?

1155
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:14,079
EB are the delta balls in the row ball

1156
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:18,079
in B and TB are I take the tubes

1157
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:22,160
um and I just take the part of the tube

1158
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:25,440
that is in the um

1159
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,720
that's in the ball be.

1160
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:33,520
>> Okay. Then

1161
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:35,040
then R E row R E R row that's the number

1162
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,720
of

1163
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:41,599
road balls in the road tube. Right. And

1164
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:43,520
the product is just delta tube.

1165
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,680
>> Right.

1166
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:49,520
Right.

1167
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:51,920
Right. So a t row is this blue tube and

1168
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,319
r of e row t row is the number of row

1169
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,240
balls in the blue tube.

1170
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:58,880
And then if we take an orange tube, it

1171
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,920
will go through this many of uh of the

1172
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,839
row balls. And we want to know how many

1173
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,520
delta balls are there in each of those

1174
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,760
bits.

1175
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,000
So now we have um some tubes at this

1176
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,559
tubes inside of B and points inside of

1177
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,559
B. And we blow that up and that's over

1178
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,559
here.

1179
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,039
Good.

1180
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:23,039
Okay. So here's something we might try.

1181
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,799
We start with E delta T delta. we don't

1182
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,640
know how to handle it. We look at the

1183
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,319
branching function. I can cut the

1184
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,400
branching function anywhere I like and

1185
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:33,440
produce two two branching functions and

1186
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,440
I can repeat that. And then I can take

1187
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,240
the different branching functions I get

1188
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:41,839
and hopefully I can put them into the

1189
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,280
list that I know how to handle um and

1190
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,240
then I'll multiply it together and I'll

1191
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,839
get an answer.

1192
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,000
Okay,

1193
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,559
so let me do a couple examples of this

1194
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,799
concatenation method and we'll see how

1195
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,799
it works.

1196
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:16,520
Okay,

1197
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,520
concatenation method.

1198
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:23,520
All right, so let me do the example

1199
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:27,200
where our graph consists of two lines.

1200
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:31,039
So it has a line of slope t1

1201
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:33,119
up to somewhere. So here's log delta of

1202
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,599
row. Then it has a line at a different

1203
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,480
slope which let's say is smaller. So

1204
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,200
here's a slope t2

1205
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,520
to the end.

1206
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:47,000
It's one. And let's say that this final

1207
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,000
height is t.

1208
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:53,839
Okay. So how are they related? So delta

1209
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,359
to the minus t is e delta which I can

1210
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:58,559
read off from my final branching

1211
01:04:55,359 --> 01:05:01,520
function. That's the size of e row times

1212
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,680
the size of eB. number of row balls

1213
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,280
times number of delta balls per row

1214
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,359
ball.

1215
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:13,359
So that is row to the minus t1.

1216
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:17,079
So this is slope t1 time delta over row

1217
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,079
to the minus t2.

1218
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:28,480
Okay. So now let's see what happens.

1219
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:35,920
So r of e t bounded by

1220
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:39,640
r of e row t row r of ebt.

1221
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,640
Scenario one.

1222
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,440
Uh in this scenario one um t1 and t2 are

1223
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:50,440
both in this middle range where b

1224
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,440
dominates.

1225
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:58,319
So then

1226
01:05:53,359 --> 01:06:01,760
this guy will give me um

1227
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:07,039
row to the s over 2 row to the minus t1

1228
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:09,680
/ 2 because this is option B b dominates

1229
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:14,000
and this guy here will give me delta

1230
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:17,760
over row to the s / 2 delta over row to

1231
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,799
the minus t2 / 2 because that's option

1232
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:24,960
B. This is not B as in ball. This is B

1233
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:27,039
as in A, B and C. The three options.

1234
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,119
All right. When we multiply it out,

1235
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:32,079
something nice happens. What happens

1236
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:35,520
when we multiply these together? We get

1237
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,839
delta to the S over two. And what

1238
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,760
happens when we multiply those together?

1239
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:41,280
Okay, at first it looks like an unholy

1240
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,960
mess,

1241
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,000
but

1242
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,000
it's the same as this.

1243
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,480
And so it's delta to the minus t / 2,

1244
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,480
which is b, which is what we were hoping

1245
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,480
for.

1246
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:06,960
This is a smiley face.

1247
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:11,359
But let me mention another scenario.

1248
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:15,440
Scenario two, maybe t1 is bigger than 2

1249
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:17,119
minus s and maybe t2 is smaller than s.

1250
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,920
So maybe this first one is really quite

1251
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,240
steep and then the second one is quite

1252
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,920
shallow.

1253
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,599
Okay.

1254
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,119
Well,

1255
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:32,720
now this first one,

1256
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:35,119
when I evaluate this, I'm in the C

1257
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:39,119
domain,

1258
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:42,000
I get row to the 1 - t1. And when I

1259
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:44,960
evaluate this, because this t2 is less

1260
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,960
than s, I'm in the a domain, which is

1261
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,960
one.

1262
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:55,839
And that's not what I'm hoping for.

1263
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:58,839
That's actually much bigger than my

1264
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,839
goal.

1265
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,160
>> So actually let me add to scenario two.

1266
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:11,119
But T is in the middle. T is a sort of

1267
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,039
average of T1 and T2. T1 is bigger. That

1268
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,319
is quite big. T2 is quite small. But

1269
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,040
this average is going to be in the

1270
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:20,319
middle. Since T is in the middle, this

1271
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,319
is the goal.

1272
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,799
How does this compare to the goal? Not

1273
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,359
so obvious, but it's much actually much

1274
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:29,120
bigger than the goal. What went wrong?

1275
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:32,480
Remember that at each step when I

1276
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:35,759
bounded R, my theorem bounds R by a

1277
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:40,120
maximum of three things.

1278
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,120
Maximum of A, B, and C.

1279
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:48,239
So this C is way bigger than B in this

1280
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:51,120
regime. And this A is way bigger than B

1281
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:53,920
in this regime. and B times B would be

1282
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,480
my goal. So this is way too big. So it

1283
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,799
doesn't work.

1284
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:03,600
Okay. So uh lesson that we learned here

1285
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:07,719
is that we want

1286
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,719
to break up f

1287
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:11,319
into pieces

1288
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,199
so that okay I'll say it in words. So

1289
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,080
first of all we'd like to be able to

1290
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:19,839
analyze each piece. So we want each

1291
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,600
piece to be on the list of things we

1292
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:22,799
understand. So if you don't have a sharp

1293
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,080
bound for the piece, there's no way

1294
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:26,799
you're going to have a sharp bound for

1295
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,799
the whole thing. But also, we're not

1296
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:31,679
happy with just any of these. We really

1297
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:36,960
want them all to be in case B.

1298
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:39,960
So So we So um

1299
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,960
right

1300
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,040
um so we really want each piece

1301
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:58,080
[Applause]

1302
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:02,159
is either uh ad regular

1303
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:07,199
with t of that piece in our middle range

1304
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,199
in the b range or semi-well spaced.

1305
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,280
Okay.

1306
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:37,600
Um so the very last idea is that indeed

1307
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,120
you can do this. You can start with an

1308
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,920
arbitrary

1309
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,719
uh branching function and then you can

1310
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:47,520
break it up into pieces where each piece

1311
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:49,440
is sort of like this.

1312
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,679
Uh I'll write it down in a sec and draw

1313
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,280
an example.

1314
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,280
Um

1315
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,000
probably the most important idea behind

1316
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,880
this is the rodamoker theorem. So the

1317
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,800
rader theorem says that a differentiable

1318
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,920
function ellipse function is

1319
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,560
differentiable almost everywhere

1320
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,719
and so this function f we don't know a

1321
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,800
lot about it but it we did see that it's

1322
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,520
a lipshits function and so it's

1323
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,120
differentiable almost everywhere. So we

1324
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,320
that means that we can cut up our

1325
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,920
interval into little intervals where

1326
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,840
maybe you have to throw out a tiny bit

1327
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,640
but on almost every little interval it's

1328
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,800
approximately a constant slope example.

1329
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,120
So you can reduce everything just just

1330
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,320
by by rodmacher theorem you can reduce

1331
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,239
everything to the ad regular case and

1332
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,520
that's an indication ad regular case is

1333
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,600
really important. It's not just a

1334
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,400
special case.

1335
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,640
However, if you do that, we would not

1336
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,159
only have slopes in here, we would also

1337
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,480
have slopes that are too small and too

1338
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,640
large. So, we want everybody to be in

1339
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:56,080
case B. And that's why we need some

1340
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:59,920
extra stuff like the semi well spaced.

1341
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:04,120
Okay. So, I will

1342
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,120
write down this last thing.

1343
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,880
So the final lema

1344
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:23,600
if f is a function from 01 to r which is

1345
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:28,480
two lip shits and increasing

1346
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:31,040
then we can break up 01 as a disjoint

1347
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:35,960
union of some intervals

1348
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,960
maybe plus tiny leftover

1349
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,800
and then on each I

1350
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:49,280
either

1351
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:51,520
um F restricted to I either F is almost

1352
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,840
linear

1353
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:59,560
um with slope

1354
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,560
TI and TI is in our range.

1355
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,800
Ah okay I should say one other thing. So

1356
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:07,120
f let's say f of one is t and t is in

1357
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,880
our range.

1358
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,000
Uh oh yeah and yeah and we should sorry

1359
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,840
we should have f ofx is bigger than tx.

1360
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,360
So this is our setup. We have a delta t

1361
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,199
set branching function. Okay so either

1362
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:22,960
it's almost linear and it slope is in

1363
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:25,960
the desired range or on i f is semi well

1364
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,960
spaced.

1365
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,840
Okay.

1366
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,159
Um it's not so difficult to prove once

1367
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,960
you think to try to prove it. And I'm

1368
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:41,960
just going to illustrate it with an an

1369
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,960
example.

1370
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:50,560
So I suppose f

1371
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:52,560
looks like this. And so the slope is

1372
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,480
increasing for a while. I guess it needs

1373
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,760
to start bigger than t. It's a bit

1374
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,600
tricky to draw this picture here. Hold.

1375
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,760
So it needs to stay above this dotted

1376
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,600
line, right?

1377
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,280
Okay. So it's going to start tangent to

1378
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,920
the line, which is okay. The slope

1379
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:09,840
increases for a while, has a maximum

1380
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,159
slope and the slope decreases and it

1381
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,640
goes like that. And as this slope

1382
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:20,640
increases, there is a key moment

1383
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:25,760
where the slope gets too big.

1384
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:28,080
Over here, the slope is 2 minus s.

1385
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,000
And maybe at the end the slope is too

1386
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:34,159
small, slope is less than s.

1387
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:40,080
Okay, so what should we do?

1388
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:44,600
Well, um, this whole thing here,

1389
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,600
this whole thing is semi well spaced.

1390
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,320
And at the beginning, we can take very

1391
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,600
short intervals.

1392
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:59,920
So, we'll have this guy and this guy and

1393
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,920
this guy. And these blue guys are um

1394
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,800
almost they're short, so it's almost

1395
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,800
linear.

1396
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:12,239
And the slope is not yet bigger than 2 -

1397
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:15,719
s. So the slope ti is less than 2 - s

1398
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,719
bigger than s.

1399
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,800
Okay, this is not a proof but you know

1400
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,360
there are not that many ways this

1401
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,360
function could look and if you draw like

1402
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:29,320
five of them you can convince yourself

1403
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,320
that if you want you can prove.

1404
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:37,120
Okay. Um so to summarize

1405
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,760
um

1406
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,679
this picture, this fact is very powerful

1407
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,400
because it lets us break up our original

1408
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:46,320
problem into smaller problems.

1409
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,600
And the smaller problems in terms of the

1410
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,520
branching functions of the smaller

1411
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,800
problems are just little pieces of the

1412
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,880
branching function of the bigger

1413
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,560
problem. And when you do that there

1414
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,719
um

1415
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:03,440
uh what originally looked like we just

1416
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,600
had a few special cases. Now we can take

1417
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,480
any combination of those few special

1418
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:12,040
cases and that turns out to be a lot and

1419
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,040
even to be everything.

1420
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,560
So that that

1421
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,080
that's the that's the last idea of the

1422
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,719
proof. The proof how to put the pieces

1423
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,199
together. And so these pieces were were

1424
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,960
not just special cases. They they they

1425
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:28,719
are really the fundamental building

1426
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,159
blocks of the whole story. Um and it's

1427
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,880
also is striking to me that this

1428
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:35,920
multiscale argument. It was really

1429
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,880
crucial in both the ad regular case and

1430
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,800
the notad regular case.

1431
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,280
In the ad regular case, these problems

1432
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,480
were all the same. And then seeing that

1433
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,719
sameness at all these different

1434
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,520
situations, it gave us some some extra

1435
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,120
rigidity and structure. In the not 80

1436
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,199
regular case by definition these

1437
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,120
problems are different and that means

1438
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,800
that gives us a whole menu of problems

1439
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,320
to choose from and then we can sort of

1440
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,040
look through this menu and try to find

1441
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,040
the things that we understand.

1442
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,080
Okay, cool.

1443
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,239
Okay, so that was an outline of

1444
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,000
projection theory. Uh thank you for

1445
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:14,800
coming with me on this on this outline.

1446
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:19,120
It's been nice talking with you all and

1447
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,120
uh yeah, let's stop the class there.
