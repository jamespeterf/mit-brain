1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,480
I'd like to start since today it's it's

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,400
March

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,000
8th

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,960
2024 I don't know if it is politically

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,439
correct so maybe MIT uh open course

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,080
whereare will cut this part but uh I

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,560
like to dedicate

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,680
this um to one special woman for me who

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,559
is my mother who would have been 100

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:43,480
today so that's kind of

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,719
a u dedication personal dedication any

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,600
anyway okay so we

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,719
are talking about uh exelis and today

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:58,359
we'll hopefully finish this uh this

15
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:01,519
part uh remember last time

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,680
we um talked about what

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:09,159
the the exergy associ associated with

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,159
the bulk flow uh in

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,000
state which uh is this um linear

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,880
combination of enthalpy and

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,840
entropy and which represents the

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,640
maximum work you can extract from that

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,400
Bulow uh state in this situation but it

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,920
also represents the minimum work to

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,960
produce from environmental condition uh

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,960
that same bulk Flow

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
State

28
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:52,439
so that means that if you combine those

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:56,200
two ideas and you consider a a

30
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:01,640
flow that you want to change from a bulk

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,640
Flow State one to another state two

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,560
depending

33
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:10,360
on uh what how these states are uh how

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,720
they

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:18,440
compare you may um be able to do that

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,640
while extracting some work or you may be

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,000
uh needing to spend some work to do that

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,560
change of

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,360
state and the work

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,920
involved always in a machine

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,879
I mean you you can picture it in terms

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,319
of a Machinery that uh always has to

43
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
interact with the environment so as to

44
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,280
uh perform the entropy exchanges that

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,800
are

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,800
needed so that uh the changes here are

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
not accomplished by entropy production

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,400
by reversibility which would

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,560
be loss of

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,319
efficiency uh but uh the entropy changes

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,480
are provided through the Machinery by

52
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
the

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,239
environment uh so the maximum work you

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,400
can extract or the minimum work you need

55
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,120
to

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,560
spend uh is equal to the difference in

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:24,680
the uh exergies between the uh input and

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,680
the output or the output and the

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,920
input and as you see

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,280
here I've rearranged this uh

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,040
expression collecting um the m dot Delta

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,360
H

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,480
outside and so this uh see this

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,360
represents uh the energy

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:52,680
change of of your bulk flow um and uh so

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,680
you could you could even call it

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,920
heat it's not really a heat interaction

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,959
because the bulk flow typically changes

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,120
in temperature along the pipe or uh

70
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,599
whatever um pieces of equipment it flows

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,120
through uh so it it as it changes in

72
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,159
temperature if it experiences heat

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,479
interactions there are going to be many

74
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,440
different heat interactions at different

75
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,840
temperatures but you could also

76
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,479
represent this as an overall uh or say

77
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,120
an equivalent heat interaction that

78
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,120
would transfer the same amount of

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,600
energy and so you get this quote

80
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,479
heat multiplied by something that looks

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,120
like a carau

82
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:44,199
coefficient if you

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,039
interpret Delta H over Delta S as an

84
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:51,720
equivalent heat

85
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:54,320
temperature uh then this becomes a Kel

86
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,840
coefficient I'm mentioning that because

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,160
often people like to um Trace back to

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,360
the to find caral coefficient

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,000
in all situations and right so this is

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,000
the correct Carno coefficient in this

91
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,360
situation so for

92
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,440
example this would be a heat pump set up

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,440
and then you want so you uh you can

94
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,800
define a first flow efficiency which is

95
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:36,280
the ratio of the heating of your uh flow

96
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:39,560
um to the the work you spent that's the

97
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:44,479
cop you can also call call it first flow

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:49,080
efficiency but it can be greater than

99
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,440
one and you can define a second LW

100
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,520
efficiency as the

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,919
ratio of the exergy associated with the

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,600
useful effect which is in this case is

103
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:05,639
heating up this

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,039
flow so this this is x 2 minus

105
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,440
X1 on the numerator divided by the

106
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,840
exergy of the resource that youve used

107
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:20,120
in this case uh the

108
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:24,280
work and um again you can

109
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,360
represent this changing enthalpy uh as a

110
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,160
as a heat you can call it heat and then

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,720
that heat gets multiplied uh by a a

112
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,800
Carno coefficient that transforms it to

113
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,680
the associated exergy as we have

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,919
seen now it turns out that this

115
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,919
temperature so it's the

116
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,039
equivalent temperature uh of a heat

117
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,880
source that would provide the same

118
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,720
amount of energy and the Chang in

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,000
enthalpy and the same amount of entropy

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,639
to the to the flow and the ratio of that

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,240
energy over entropy provided to the flow

122
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,759
is dimensions of temperature and we'll

123
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,960
see in a moment that it corresponds in

124
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,319
several um

125
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,560
cases to the logarithmic mean

126
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,759
temperature between the two um the inlet

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,759
and

128
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,599
Outlet uh before I go to

129
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:34,639
that let me take up a very simple

130
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:38,599
example but which is any any way

131
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:44,000
interesting it's uh the exergy of a

132
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,000
waterfall of a hydraul hydraulic

133
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:51,080
jump as you know um wherever there is

134
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,879
such an opportunity people have invested

135
00:07:51,080 --> 00:08:01,440
and uh uh it's very hard to find a a

136
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,440
hydraulic jump that has not been uh

137
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,479
transformed in a renewable energy uh

138
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Source this waterfall is the highest in

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,800
Europe among uh it's not the highest

140
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,680
waterfall but it's the highest

141
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,199
artificial one it was made up by the

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,120
Romans uh not for energy reasons that I

143
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,159
think they only needed to avoid some

144
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,320
floods related to

145
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:36,599
Lake that was above

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,159
there but as soon as it was possible uh

147
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:43,519
probably at the end of

148
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:47,279
U I think the 19th

149
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:51,640
century um they they started exploiting

150
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,160
it now uh it is um used almost every

151
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,720
hour of the day except when the groups

152
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,279
of tourists are there then they uh stop

153
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,680
they let the water fall

154
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,959
so just to to show

155
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,240
it because it is an

156
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,160
attraction okay so how do we you anal

157
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,680
analyze something like

158
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,440
that in in in an example like that the

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,320
bulk flow state is characterized not

160
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,560
only by the thermal aspect so is not

161
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,120
only a change in the

162
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,839
enthalpy uh but you also have to take

163
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,760
remember that the bulk Flow State also

164
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,760
has a the kinetic energy and the

165
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,360
potential energy in this case what's

166
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,760
important is the potential energy which

167
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,279
of course changes from this elevation to

168
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,000
the elevation at the bottom where then

169
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,000
the water goes

170
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,440
away you can neglect instead uh the

171
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,680
kinetic

172
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:58,160
energy so the energy balance reads like

173
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,839
this presumably this is when you um

174
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,600
don't just let it go as a waterfall but

175
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,200
you pass it through a a proper turbine

176
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,480
hydraulic turbine to uh to use to

177
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,440
transform

178
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:19,120
the uh this energy into work mechanical

179
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,800
work also if you recall

180
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,320
our formulas for the um

181
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:31,399
ideal um fluid ideal um Inc compressible

182
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,720
fluid the change in uh the enthalpy is

183
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,200
equal to the specific heat times the

184
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,480
change in temperature there would be

185
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,440
also an additional term which is a spe

186
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,200
plus the specific volume times the

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,240
change in pressure but here um the water

188
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,360
up and down is that same atmospheric

189
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,720
pressure so that doesn't uh

190
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,720
contribute so this is what we are left

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,720
with so the change in elevation or the

192
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,959
change in potential energy can be

193
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,360
transformed in either in work if you're

194
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:12,320
using it or it in in an increase in

195
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,519
temperature so if you uh do not exploit

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,279
uh

197
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,760
the

198
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,040
um this thing and this energy and you

199
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,040
just let it run as a waterfall there is

200
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,560
no work so this and that become equal

201
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,880
and if you put them equal you find that

202
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,120
the there is an increase in

203
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,760
temperature of the

204
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,079
water

205
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,320
which per unit

206
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:46,040
of uh jump or change in

207
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,360
elevation is given by G the

208
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:53,880
gravitational constant divided by C the

209
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,200
specific heat of water which is 4.2 KJ

210
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,360
per kilogram

211
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,519
K and that if you change if you

212
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:06,720
represent it in the the fancy units like

213
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,160
degrees Celsius over per meter it says

214
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,639
that if you have a

215
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:17,240
waterfall uh higher than this one 430 M

216
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:20,839
the the temperature increase uh below

217
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,040
will be 1°

218
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,959
c not

219
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,880
much uh then you can compute of course

220
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:31,959
the entropy produced by irreversibility

221
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,040
because that's the entropy

222
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:38,120
balance and uh and again you remember

223
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,000
what uh for the in compressible fluid

224
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,880
model uh the entropy goes as c times the

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,880
logarithm of the

226
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,480
temperatures so you can rewrite this

227
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,519
this way and since the temperature

228
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:56,959
increase is small just one degree is

229
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:59,399
small with respect to say the absolute

230
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,959
temperature we

231
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,399
which is like

232
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,199
300K so one over 300 is small with

233
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,920
respect to one so you can approximate

234
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:12,880
the logarithm of one plus X as

235
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,720
X all right and so here is

236
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,760
the the approximation and you find you

237
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,079
can compute how much entrop is produced

238
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,680
by irreversibility if this uh work is

239
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,839
zero if this formula is also valid also

240
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,399
if you get some work but not the entire

241
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,800
maximum

242
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,000
the maximum you get of course when uh

243
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,399
there is no entropy produced by IR

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,800
reversibility so so if in as far as this

245
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,199
is a good formula for the entropy

246
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,360
production it is set to zero when the

247
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,360
work is equal to the potential energy

248
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,160
change and that

249
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:06,120
is you can it's like per unit uh so per

250
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:09,160
per unit mass of uh water that falls and

251
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,600
per unit of

252
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:18,440
height it's equal to

253
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:22,240
G and G can be written as of course 9.8

254
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,759
M seconds squared but it can also be

255
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,639
written in these other fancy units is 42

256
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:31,959
megga per

257
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,959
ton over 4.3

258
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:40,800
kilomet now 4.3 kilomet is about the

259
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,720
height of the tallest mountain in Europe

260
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,560
mon

261
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,639
Blanc so this means that if you take a

262
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,920
ton of

263
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:55,240
water and uh have it pull it down by

264
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,199
from the top of bom blank to ca

265
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,720
level you get 42 Mega and 42 megga is is

266
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:06,120
an interesting number because it is the

267
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:09,800
heating power of 1 kilogram of

268
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,279
oil okay so that gives you the order of

269
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,839
magnitude of this kind

270
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:21,600
of things so you need one

271
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:25,519
ton uh and the entire height of Monon

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,120
Blanc to match what you can do with one

273
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,680
kilogram of oil that shows you the

274
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,839
density of

275
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,839
uh available power that is in

276
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,199
hydrocarbons

277
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,279
okay you can do the

278
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,519
same in uh

279
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,880
cooling so uh I won't

280
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:58,079
go much over the details of this uh

281
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,079
slide you find the same ratio here

282
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,839
and U

283
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:07,319
again you when you do when you analyze

284
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,360
problems like

285
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,839
this for

286
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,120
example you could have a situation in

287
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:19,319
which you your Machinery not

288
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:23,880
only processes a flow of material but

289
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:27,199
maybe it also uses uh heat from some

290
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,279
Source given temperature and then uses

291
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,399
work or produces work

292
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,399
so this uh would require that you make

293
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,120
an energy balance like this so you have

294
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,440
two working I mean two heat interactions

295
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,720
one with the heat Source at temperature

296
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,639
T Q and the other uh with the uh heat

297
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:53,639
Source uh the environment which is

298
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,639
always there to match to balance the

299
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,720
entropy and then you have your entropy

300
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,120
balance and then as you have seen we've

301
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,760
seen it several times now if you combine

302
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,160
these two balances by taking the entropy

303
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,360
balance multiplied by the environmental

304
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,160
temperature and subtracting it from the

305
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,160
energy balance you get the so-called

306
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,319
xergy balance where you have the various

307
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,839
um Heats multiplied by their

308
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,360
own Carno

309
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,120
coefficient fact the caral coefficient

310
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,200
of the environmental temperature is zero

311
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:37,080
here so there's no involved with the um

312
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,360
um with with this uh heat

313
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,440
interaction this is the Caro coefficient

314
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,880
that we just talked about associated

315
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,400
with bulk flow changes and this is the

316
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,080
exergy loss or destroyed due to the

317
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
entropy production by

318
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,640
irreversibility now when you compute the

319
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,720
change

320
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:09,080
in uh exergy for a bulk

321
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,120
flow and you compute it for particular

322
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,400
substances then you have to substitute

323
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,360
the constitutive relations for that for

324
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,159
those substances those relations that

325
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,640
relate uh the enthalpy and the entropy

326
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,559
to the temperature and the pressure for

327
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,120
example if we are using a liquid so this

328
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,120
SL slide is for a

329
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,880
liquid uh as I said the

330
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,480
enthalpy change is equal to C specific

331
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,480
it times the temperature change times

332
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,640
the specific volume you can also write

333
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,080
that as one over the density times the

334
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,600
uh pressure

335
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,880
change and the entropy is c times the

336
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,880
log of the ratio of two

337
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,679
temperatures now if you okay so you can

338
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,679
substitute collect

339
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,840
U yeah collect

340
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,880
the the heat part so that you may you

341
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,960
put in evidence this carol coefficient

342
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,200
looking like uh term and then there is a

343
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,320
term here which is connected with the

344
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,200
pressure

345
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,960
drops pressure drop uh as the flow goes

346
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,919
there now if you can neglect this

347
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,320
pressure

348
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:29,200
drop at least neglect these with respect

349
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,440
to the thermal as part of this changing

350
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,400
exergy then you you get that the your

351
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,280
changing ex exg is equal to the the heat

352
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,799
times the kernal coefficient and this

353
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,679
temperature equivalent TQ is given by

354
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,320
this logarithmic mean temperature of the

355
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,280
inlet Outlet

356
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,280
temperatures I do the same for ideal

357
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:01,159
gas so for the ideal

358
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,640
gas things change a bit because now the

359
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,159
enthalpy is a function only of

360
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,080
temperature and the Chang in enthalpy is

361
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,760
the specific he at constant pressure

362
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,000
times the changeing

363
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,640
temperature and it's now the entropy

364
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,360
that uh depends on pressure and

365
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,240
temperature so it's CP log of the ratio

366
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,960
of the T minus r log of the ratios of

367
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,520
the p ratio of the

368
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,960
pressures so you get uh you can put it

369
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,120
in exactly the C same formal relation

370
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,480
except that here you have a c CP instead

371
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,600
of c and here you have the log of the

372
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,799
rati the

373
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,960
pressures this is again related to the

374
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,799
pressure

375
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,960
drop

376
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,280
um

377
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,080
namely the work you need to spend in

378
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,000
order to overcome the friction forces

379
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:59,440
over along the the pipe in order to make

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,559
the flow uh um

381
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,480
overcome those but if you can neglect

382
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,000
those then we get again this formula and

383
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,240
again TQ is the log mean

384
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
temperature and there is a third case in

385
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,360
which you have a similar situation which

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,120
is whenever you are changing phase your

387
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,120
flow is maybe boiling or

388
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,279
condensing

389
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,840
um then the change in alpy is equal to

390
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:37,679
the change in the

391
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:41,200
quality of the so the The Vapor fraction

392
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,679
that we defined last time it's a so the

393
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,720
changing quality times the enthalpy

394
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:50,279
vaporization for H2 minus H1

395
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,200
or the change in quality times the

396
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,360
entropy of vaporization for the change

397
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:59,960
in entropy so you can also do the same

398
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:03,360
thing put out outside uh the the energy

399
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,240
change of your flow call it

400
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,600
q and what's left as a form of a Caro

401
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,320
ratio where the TQ is the ratio between

402
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,159
the enthalpy and the entropy of

403
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,400
vaporization which is exactly the

404
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:21,120
temperature at which uh the boiling and

405
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,120
or condensation

406
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:30,240
occurs

407
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,520
so for example let's compute

408
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,520
this

409
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:41,240
number uh for the case of heating water

410
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,120
which is useful for for example

411
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,240
industrial uh applications you often

412
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:51,360
need uh steam or hot water to for many

413
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:56,159
processes or Residential

414
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,159
Heating to heat up your homes

415
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,559
all right so if so what we what I want

416
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,559
to compute is the this

417
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,559
carau

418
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,440
coefficient which you see is therefore

419
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,039
the ratio between the

420
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,039
exergy over the heat that is

421
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,080
provided so it's it's the exergy content

422
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:35,520
of your heated water after you heat it

423
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,440
that's the exoy and the exoy remember is

424
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,320
the

425
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:46,520
minimum work required to do that uh

426
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,279
job so this ratio exergy change over

427
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,919
heat represents the

428
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,279
minimum work per unit

429
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,279
energy of your

430
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:04,320
heating and uh so that is

431
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,320
useful so it's it's the best you can

432
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,000
do so if you compute it for these uh

433
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,840
temperatures from say heating water from

434
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,840
60 Dees to 120 which corresponds to an

435
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,840
industrial

436
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,640
application

437
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:28,919
and assume an environment at

438
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,919
300K at 27° C

439
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,039
here's the number you you compute that

440
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,039
number you get

441
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,000
17.2% If instead you you're you're

442
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,840
needing water from 20 to 60 degrees

443
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,559
Celsius in the same environment that

444
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,559
would be

445
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,559
4%

446
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,880
okay so this is interesting because for

447
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:02,039
example let me ask you

448
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,919
with this number can you tell me what is

449
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:10,600
the second LW

450
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:15,840
efficiency of doing for example this

451
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:18,880
heating uh this heating with an electric

452
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,399
boiler an electric boiler uses

453
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:26,000
electricity electricity is pure

454
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:32,559
exergy all right so how do you define

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,559
the second law efficiency it's AA

456
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:40,039
2 is equal to the

457
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:42,120
exergy of your

458
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,120
uh uh

459
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,440
result useful

460
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,440
effects times the

461
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,440
xergy

462
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,440
consumed all

463
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,840
right so in this case you're using work

464
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:06,120
the the xergy consumed is equal to the

465
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,120
work that you're using in your electric

466
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,440
boiler and the

467
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,360
exergy up

468
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:30,000
there is Q * 1 -

469
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:30,000
ta/ TQ where TQ is the logarithmic mean

470
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,919
temperature so it's precisely what we

471
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,919
have computed

472
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,279
here now in an electric

473
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,039
boiler your work is completely

474
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:51,760
transformed into heat by Jewel

475
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:55,000
effect so even if if your boiler were

476
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:00,360
100% efficient very well

477
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,960
insulated you get that Q is equal to

478
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,960
W

479
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,799
okay so we are left that the second low

480
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,720
efficiency is

481
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:14,720
equal in this case to

482
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,320
4% so 4% and this is the kind of

483
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,000
efficiency that signals how much room

484
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,480
for improvement is there so there is 96%

485
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,480
room for improvement

486
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,720
nevertheless we do use electric boilers

487
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,880
but

488
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,399
where you use them where uh you don't

489
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,159
need to this to heat water all the all

490
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:52,919
the time for example in the south of

491
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,559
Italy uh where I have a small house with

492
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:00,080
olive trees and I go there just for the

493
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:03,480
summer I have electric boilers

494
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,960
because I use them maybe one month per

495
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:14,159
year so the cost uh the investment

496
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:17,080
cost uh doesn't uh uh wouldn't pay if I

497
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,840
buy a more efficient equipment like

498
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,840
would be a heat

499
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,360
pump or even a gas which is sort of

500
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,880
intermediate because the more efficient

501
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,679
is the equipment the high higher the

502
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,679
more complicated is the Machinery so the

503
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:37,960
higher the cost and so the

504
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:42,720
uh if I use it for only few months a

505
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:46,000
year I uh it doesn't pay to invest that

506
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:50,760
much so but still you have to keep that

507
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:56,679
in mind that this is the idea and

508
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:58,720
maybe I could have uh uh invested in uh

509
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,120
solar thermal

510
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,760
heating okay which would even save me

511
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,399
the cost of

512
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,279
electricity at the expense of uh

513
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:11,279
investment cost for the

514
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:20,399
equipment but also that as a problem in

515
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:24,080
in some uh countries and especially in

516
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:27,799
the countryside where uh these equipment

517
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,559
is left outside with nobody watching uh

518
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:36,440
it's it is easily stolen so uh that's

519
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,440
another uh issue uh

520
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,000
security all

521
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:47,760
right so we talked we we let me say a

522
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,039
little more about uh fuels because we

523
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,559
will u in the second part of the course

524
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,559
we will uh uh do

525
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:03,120
um systems with chemical reactions and

526
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,440
uh so we will return to this in in much

527
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:11,799
more detail but for the moment let me

528
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:15,360
just say that if I were to heat up

529
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,480
something uh or water with with a gas

530
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,519
boiler I would need to put here the

531
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,039
exergy of the fuel that I have consumed

532
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:26,120
so how do you compute exergy for a fuel

533
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,640
right the the the idea is the following

534
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,640
you take your fuel

535
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,559
at environmental conditions and in uh

536
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,840
the and you mix

537
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:43,679
it or keep it separate uh with

538
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,840
um the sufficient just sufficient air so

539
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,480
the stochiometric amount of air that is

540
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,600
needed to oxidize that

541
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,960
fuel and then you have

542
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,600
a piece of

543
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:02,000
equipment which um you try to make as

544
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,000
close to reversible as

545
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,360
possible and while this equipment

546
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,039
produces the combustion or the oxidation

547
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,600
of your fuels and therefore produces

548
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,600
products of

549
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,799
combustion it produces also

550
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,399
work it needs as usual an interaction

551
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:29,399
with the environment so as to exchange

552
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:33,279
the entropy that is needed

553
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:36,240
to perform uh to to balance the entropy

554
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,240
without the need of

555
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,679
irreversibility and uh so this result is

556
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,720
the exergy of your fuel the maximum work

557
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,679
you can

558
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,080
extract while your products of

559
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:52,360
combustion notice

560
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,279
are down in mutual equilibrium with the

561
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,799
environment so are again at

562
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,840
environmental

563
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,840
conditions so typical

564
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,399
we will see that

565
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:12,279
um the exergy of the fuel will be given

566
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,760
by this expression we will define an

567
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:21,760
enthalpy of of the

568
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:24,399
combustion reaction and an entropy of

569
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,279
combustion so this will be this

570
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,279
combination is the Gibs free energy

571
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,240
of the combustion at standard conditions

572
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,080
of pressure and temperature that's the

573
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,639
meaning of the not up there the

574
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,519
superscript and with a minus in front

575
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:45,600
that will

576
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:48,320
be uh um the most the most important

577
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,399
contribution to the exergy of the fuel

578
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,639
there will be some term related to

579
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,840
mixing that we will see later uh

580
00:32:53,639 --> 00:33:00,000
regarding the heat of the heating Val

581
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,919
value the heating value if I go back to

582
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,760
this previous slide now

583
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:11,320
suppose I don't have

584
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:14,880
any uh work extraction here and all I

585
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,799
have is a an interaction with the en

586
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,679
environment and uh and so I burn my fuel

587
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,760
and then exit the products so cool down

588
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,279
the products at uh of combustion at an

589
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,519
environmental temperature in order to

590
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,880
cool uh that doing that cool cooling

591
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,240
down I need to extract heat that heat is

592
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,120
the heating value of the

593
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,559
fuel again we'll return to

594
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,360
those the message

595
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:48,399
here for practical uh applications in

596
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,480
which you need to to compute exergy of a

597
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,880
fuel

598
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,320
the the rule of f is that U turns out

599
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,480
that for all hydrocarbons we'll see the

600
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,000
the detail the

601
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,560
list the ratio of this part of the

602
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,720
contribution to that part is

603
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,240
small plus or minus

604
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,040
2.5% so if you accept that kind of

605
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,760
approximation and typically in exg

606
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:24,200
computations you can you can afford that

607
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:27,399
kind of precision uh you can simply see

608
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:30,000
can neglect this part and so see that

609
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:34,240
the xgy and the

610
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,639
heating value are approximately equal so

611
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,440
you can say that the exergy of the fuel

612
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,560
is approximately equal to the heating

613
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,320
Val to to the yeah to

614
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,679
the yes to the heating value of the fuel

615
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,399
which is all in turn approximately equal

616
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,399
to the lower uh heating value

617
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,000
as you know there is a distinction

618
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,760
between lower heating value and higher

619
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,040
heating value which has to do with the

620
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,640
fact that in the products of combustion

621
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,079
there is

622
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:19,839
water and if you do the cooling of that

623
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,720
water uh of that um stream of produ

624
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,079
combustion down to environmental

625
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,320
conditions some of the

626
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,320
water will condense

627
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:41,359
and U and that uh and so the condensing

628
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:44,839
of the water releases the enthalpy of

629
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:49,839
vaporization and that is additional uh

630
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:53,599
energy that you can in principle

631
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,400
extract so the the difference so they

632
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,720
you call lower heating value when

633
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,599
you uh we you you pretend that water

634
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,440
doesn't doesn't condense even even if

635
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,599
you're going down to 25

636
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,200
Celsius and the higher heating value is

637
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,480
the opposite case you pretend that it

638
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,800
all condenses even though uh in part of

639
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,480
the water remains is a form of vapor

640
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,440
mixed with the products of combustion so

641
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,440
these are two extremes and for example

642
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,000
methane has a lower heating value of 50

643
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,440
megga per

644
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,119
kilogram and a higher heating value of

645
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,040
55 so it's it's not an an important

646
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,920
effect it's like 10% the contribution

647
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,920
the difference so the contribution of

648
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,079
condensation

649
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,160
okay in this table I

650
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,520
listed some heating values of some

651
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,520
typical fuels

652
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,400
um

653
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,800
yes there are still technical units

654
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,359
around in Europe it's like kilo Cals per

655
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,920
kilogram here you get still

656
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:19,920
BTUs per

657
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,920
pound

658
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:29,280
um International System of Units is more

659
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,800
like Jews this is Mega per kilogram

660
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,520
and you see that more or less when you

661
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,200
present uh in terms of these units per

662
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:40,240
kilogram the fuels have different

663
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,760
definitely heating

664
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:51,240
values but they are within a limited

665
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,240
range they're all around 40 42 is crude

666
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,079
oil I mean a typical value because crude

667
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,119
oil is varies a lot from place to place

668
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,319
but the

669
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:07,040
uh the the the canonical standard is 42

670
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:10,280
megga that number that we've uh

671
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,800
corresponds as we've seen in this

672
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,680
waterfall example to lifting one ton of

673
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,040
water up to the top of mon Blanc from

674
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,040
sea

675
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,040
level the same energy is what is needed

676
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,440
to heat up one ton of water by 10

677
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,440
degrees Celsius

678
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:41,240
or to evaporate not one ton but 18

679
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,240
kilograms of water at atmospheric

680
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,560
pressure so that's also oxidizing 1

681
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,800
kilogram of

682
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:54,040
oil so that's the heating value of 1

683
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:58,319
kilogram if you compare it to the power

684
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:01,640
density in some other uh

685
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:07,760
uh natural I mean resource for

686
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:09,440
a for primary energy fish of uranium

687
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,400
isotope to

688
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,119
233 a half milligram of that will give

689
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,280
you that same amount so you see how

690
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:22,599
different U uh concentrations of

691
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,599
energies we we

692
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,280
have okay

693
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,640
now for reasons that we will see later

694
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,000
but also just for fun you can plot on a

695
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,720
uh this

696
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,079
graph uh the history of efficiencies

697
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,200
second low

698
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,880
efficiencies

699
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:01,960
of technologies that man

700
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,800
mankind has developed uh over the years

701
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,520
uh to

702
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:13,560
convert uh fuel exergy into

703
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:17,160
work starting from the early

704
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,400
um the beginning of the Industrial

705
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:23,480
Revolution in in in England where you

706
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,319
would use a

707
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,160
vapor uh to extract uh to pump water out

708
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,119
of the coal

709
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,880
mines and then you see recognize here

710
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:40,640
some names see this were efficiency of

711
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,640
the order of this number is um okay I'm

712
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,160
sorry the efficiency are on this side of

713
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,359
the graph it's like

714
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:52,119
1% today you go

715
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:54,920
up we are of the order of

716
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,240
60 65 almost

717
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,240
65% the best available

718
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:09,319
technology is of is is reaching this

719
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:13,280
much um the the the

720
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:16,240
diagram is made a straight line by

721
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,560
plotting not the in

722
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,520
linear you see this scale is not linear

723
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:26,240
in the second low efficiency it's linear

724
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:28,960
in the efficiency over the one minus the

725
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,680
efficiency so the the efficiency divided

726
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,040
by the room for improvement this ratio

727
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,920
is called the logistic

728
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,160
scale uh you could plot the same diagram

729
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:45,920
on a linear scale for for and you you

730
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:48,560
would get a typical s shaped curve

731
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,560
typical of any

732
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
learning

733
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,960
process and in fact fact you see and you

734
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,480
can even write the the differential

735
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,680
equation for this uh to obtain this

736
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,920
formula from which it is interesting to

737
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,240
that you extract the time constant the

738
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,720
characteristic time of this

739
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,720
learning and this time constant is 60

740
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,800
years

741
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:28,079
right uh I think it you can prove that U

742
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,760
it's related to

743
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,359
this slope here the maximum height so in

744
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,040
other words it took us 300 years to go

745
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,920
from 1% to

746
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,200
65% and we are not done

747
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:49,520
yet H because you you know this is the

748
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:53,400
second low efficiency the upper limit is

749
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,119
one so that means that we

750
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,440
will

751
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,640
continue so at the end of this

752
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Century if we if our learning process

753
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,280
goes

754
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,280
on uh we will be at

755
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,599
85% and still it will go at least this

756
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,319
is what history uh tells

757
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,079
us but since the remarkable cor

758
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:23,400
correlation is very remarkable here it's

759
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:28,040
very likely that we we do uh since this

760
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:30,760
is typical of any human there are uh um

761
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,400
there is an entire section of the

762
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:37,359
literature about the studies of the

763
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,920
history of technologies that represent

764
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,960
many uh other Technologies uh of on

765
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,520
these logistic graphs and they all show

766
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,559
similar Behavior you could also plot

767
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,200
here

768
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:57,880
um the number of words of that a child

769
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:00,280
learns uh during his um

770
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:05,200
from when it doesn't speak to when it

771
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,200
starts speaking and it follows the same

772
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,119
curve

773
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,119
okay and here also for fun I just

774
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:22,319
uh put the arrows on the

775
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,319
timeline where the various names that

776
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:30,040
are associated with thermodynamics see

777
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:36,240
ranking balsman and so on

778
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:36,240
um are placed with respect to this

779
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:45,839
graph somewhere I

780
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,839
think somewhere

781
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:54,280
here or is it there yeah no probably

782
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:58,520
here um that name

783
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,440
moer um who gave the name of uh to the

784
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,720
to the graph the to the to the enthalpy

785
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,880
versus entropy graph that I discussed

786
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,319
the other

787
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:14,319
day uh he's here and he

788
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:17,440
um he's also important because his

789
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:21,000
student was nelt nelt is another name

790
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,079
you might have heard from he transfer so

791
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,200
he was a student of moer and actually I

792
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,400
think it's we pronounce it moer think

793
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,280
that it is French but he was German so I

794
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:36,440
don't know how the German pronounced M

795
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:39,880
but I'll let you figure it

796
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:43,119
out in any case if you like I also put

797
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,720
this slide because I wanted to advertise

798
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,240
uh if you click here you go to the

799
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:54,000
proceedings of a conference that we held

800
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:59,359
uh U 2008 uh in memory of Professor

801
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,480
Kenan and uh uh so we Ed at this volume

802
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:06,599
and there are contributions about the

803
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,200
this the state of thermodynamics at that

804
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:12,559
time which is not very different from

805
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,920
the current one with big names including

806
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:21,000
uh Sten Chu Max Tark

807
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:23,599
and many others that U are considered

808
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,720
big uh big names in in the field of

809
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,200
thermodynamics and

810
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,720
energy all all right

811
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:34,000
so why am I talking about that all right

812
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,480
well

813
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,920
because we've seen the history tells us

814
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,599
that we are going to to to go to 85%

815
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:47,040
efficient by the end of the century now

816
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,960
how can we do that because currently we

817
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,440
the point of this slide is that uh we

818
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:56,960
cannot do it with current

819
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:02,240
technology at least not with the current

820
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:06,000
technology that uses the fuel to burn uh

821
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,720
to to in a flame in a combustion process

822
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,680
the reason is because this is the the

823
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:16,079
philosophy of of our uh traditional

824
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,200
power plants flame based is that you

825
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,359
burn the

826
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,440
fuel and with the hot products of

827
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,960
combustion you hit some working fluid

828
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:30,319
and you put it somewhere and you make it

829
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,319
work in a thermal uh

830
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:39,319
cycle the thermal

831
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:43,240
cycle for example in a combined gas uh

832
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:45,160
turbine and U gas turbine and steam

833
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:49,559
thermal

834
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:52,839
cycle has an efficiency of about 85% so

835
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:56,520
it means that your irreversibility in

836
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:59,079
your power plant waste only 15% of the

837
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,280
exit that that thermal part of your

838
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:03,839
power plant receives from the hot

839
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,839
product of

840
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:11,160
combustion and then you have the

841
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:17,800
flame the flame per se by itself without

842
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:19,520
losing one uh BTU of energy um wastes

843
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,319
because because it's an IR reversible

844
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,800
process wastes 25% of the

845
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:33,400
exergy so if you multiply the two

846
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:35,599
efficiencies here 75 * 85 you get about

847
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,079
64 and that's the

848
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:43,280
explanation of why so 64 it means that

849
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:43,280
we are wasting uh

850
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:48,920
36% of the

851
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:53,480
exy and where is where is that wasted

852
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:58,079
okay 25 here and another 15 or or more

853
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,079
or less here

854
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:12,559
so how so you see in order to get to

855
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:16,480
85% we must we must get rid of the uh

856
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:20,400
ways that we have in combustion we must

857
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,200
use the fuel not by burning it but in

858
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,599
some other

859
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:30,160
way as we

860
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,319
go uh um and as we will treat combustion

861
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,920
in a few

862
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:38,119
weeks we will end up drawing this

863
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,119
diagram in which you have the enthalpy

864
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:44,200
versus entropy looks like an energy

865
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:46,240
versus entropy diagram you have the fuel

866
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,920
air mixture here and the product of

867
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,640
combustion there and it turns out that

868
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,760
when

869
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,319
you burn your fuel in the

870
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:03,400
flame what you do is to move from this

871
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:03,400
to that and you produce entropy by

872
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,960
reversibility

873
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:14,760
whereas before burning it your fuel had

874
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,760
an exergy which is represented by this

875
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,680
much and

876
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:24,799
uh you have now here it has an exy that

877
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,079
is represented by this much so you've

878
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:29,640
wasted this much

879
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:29,640
because of this

880
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:36,359
irreversibility so that

881
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:49,160
is the Flames are the bottleneck of

882
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:49,160
efficiency in uh fuel U usage to power

883
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,359
conversion and this is why people

884
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,160
realized that of course and uh they've

885
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,200
worked they are working

886
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,920
on

887
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,960
developing

888
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,200
alternatives to uh this way of

889
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,280
burning instead of the

890
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,960
flame for example with the fuel

891
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:18,359
cells you oxidize your your

892
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:21,119
fuel while you are also extracting

893
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,119
electrical

894
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:27,480
energy because you see in order to avoid

895
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,760
the irreversibilities in uh you need to

896
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,440
be

897
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,760
quick um for example in an internal

898
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,119
combustion engine when you engine when

899
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,319
you light the

900
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:43,640
spark uh at the top that Center and the

901
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:46,200
the the fueler mixture starts to burn

902
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,040
there is a flame which propagates so you

903
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,680
you can view it in slow motion it takes

904
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:55,119
a while

905
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:59,480
to uh and Trin the entire combustion

906
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:01,760
chamber but in reality that happens in

907
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,440
milliseconds

908
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:09,880
so you have to be quicker than

909
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:13,160
that if you want to do it at that

910
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,680
level or you have to develop

911
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,680
alternatives

912
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:23,880
to um to

913
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:27,640
Flame for example you can determine a

914
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,400
different path to of oxid the fuel with

915
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:34,119
intermediate steps so that you can

916
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:37,599
control the intermediate steps uh and uh

917
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:40,319
in and use them more avoid the

918
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,079
reversibilities or you can use the fuel

919
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,119
cell which does it with

920
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,760
electrochemistry and then you can

921
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:52,240
integrate your uh fuel cell in a thermal

922
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,400
cycle that uses the thermal the thermal

923
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,240
energy that is released so the the

924
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,680
entropy that needs to be taken away from

925
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:05,480
the fuel cell is going to be used by a

926
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,240
bottoming uh thermal cycle and just

927
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:11,079
doing

928
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:15,480
that uh on paper you can you you I least

929
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:17,040
here some efficiencies that can already

930
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:22,000
be

931
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:25,000
reached which go beyond uh the limit of

932
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
flames

933
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:41,839
okay and this takes me

934
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:45,960
to this last topic of the first

935
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:51,240
part which is also going to be the topic

936
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:53,440
of the uh homework that I will put out

937
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,680
today regarding

938
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:00,599
that I'm going to put a deadline uh uh

939
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:02,839
uh which is just before uh the the

940
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:06,200
spring break

941
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:08,839
but just I did that because I want you

942
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:11,440
to be free for the spring break but if

943
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:14,160
you need to take more time feel free to

944
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,240
do it uh but I don't want to spoil your

945
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,559
your your your spring break but if you

946
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:23,920
even if you want an extra 10 days do

947
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:26,119
take them I don't really care it's your

948
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,920
choice so there is an official deadline

949
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:29,920
but it's not it can be

950
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,359
broken all

951
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:41,960
right so allocation why do we need why

952
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,960
is uh this problem uh

953
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,839
interesting okay the question what's the

954
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:49,760
question that it

955
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:52,920
answers what fraction of the

956
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,000
fuel consumed in a

957
00:54:52,920 --> 00:55:00,040
co-generation

958
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,040
facility should be allocated to the heat

959
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,960
produced you now in a cogeneration

960
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,200
facility we use the

961
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:17,400
fuel and it produces not only

962
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:20,880
electricity but it also produces

963
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,720
heat which can be used for industrial or

964
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,960
for

965
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:28,319
residential uh

966
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,319
uses okay

967
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,960
uh that heat that is produced this way

968
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:40,440
goes into the

969
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:44,039
homes and it is important to know how

970
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:46,640
much primary energy was used to produce

971
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:50,960
it why is it

972
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:53,319
important because of real estate uh and

973
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,839
efficiency

974
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:59,680
regulations now almost all countries and

975
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:04,119
I listed hear the names of

976
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:07,440
uh these regulations in various

977
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:12,599
countries see it it goes from

978
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:15,799
Europe uh uh almost anywhere including

979
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:18,760
of course the US Energy performance

980
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:20,359
certificate of building or energy score

981
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,280
home energy

982
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:26,400
score it

983
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:29,280
essentially tells you of your house what

984
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,240
the level of efficiency and that level

985
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,280
of efficiency determines the value of

986
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,839
your house if I go by by a house I care

987
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,640
about how much it consumes because

988
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:47,559
that's the bills I will receive to heat

989
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:53,079
it up uh and so if it is a an efficient

990
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:57,079
house it's it's more uh has more value

991
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,079
than in inefficiency

992
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,240
okay so this problem in fact

993
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,599
uh it's very since in order to compute

994
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:10,079
this energy score you need to

995
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,760
know uh among the various parameters

996
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:16,480
it's not only how good are the windows

997
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:22,160
and uh the walls and so on but uh the

998
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:24,079
roof but it's also how efficient is the

999
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,160
equipment that you're are using in order

1000
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,680
to produce the heating

1001
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,599
and if

1002
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:35,599
you live in a city like braa or if you

1003
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:39,079
live at MIT now I I know that also here

1004
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,240
we have the same problem that you have a

1005
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:43,880
a a co-generation facility which is not

1006
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:47,839
in your house but it's somewhere else in

1007
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,880
town and then through pipes they send

1008
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,799
heat to

1009
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:55,079
you in order to do that calculation of

1010
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:58,880
the home energy score you need to know

1011
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:01,799
how much energy was consumed was is

1012
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,640
behind that heat that you are

1013
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:09,359
using which

1014
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:10,799
substitutes your local uh um boiler or

1015
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:14,200
gas boiler

1016
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:17,839
that you you have in standard so so in

1017
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:20,640
my condominium I still have a the gas

1018
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:23,599
boiler so the the question is easily

1019
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,880
answered I look up how much heat I has

1020
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,480
been produced over one year how much gas

1021
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:33,520
I I I paid and that's that tells me how

1022
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:37,039
much energy is behind my uh BTU of heat

1023
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:42,319
produced but if it is co-produced

1024
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:44,280
cogenerated in a um heat and power

1025
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,280
uh

1026
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:51,160
facility combined hit and power CHP

1027
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:54,160
facility then uh the question is not

1028
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,160
that

1029
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,599
simple so here's the

1030
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:05,720
scheme here's the the facility which

1031
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:05,720
produces work and heat and uses

1032
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,400
fuel now

1033
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:14,760
normally that

1034
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:18,000
work would be produced in a separate

1035
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:22,280
production facility that uses just some

1036
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,599
fuel uh and produces only work and that

1037
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,240
heat would be produced like in my gas

1038
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:29,960
burner by a separate

1039
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,799
production uh equipment that uses some

1040
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,400
fuel and produces that

1041
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:40,160
heat so the question is how do we

1042
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,520
compare this separate

1043
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:47,720
production uh scenario with a

1044
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:52,480
cogeneration uh facility and how

1045
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:55,680
uh you see the the the reason is that we

1046
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,720
know before we start I mean without any

1047
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,839
uh

1048
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:04,440
additional discussion we we can

1049
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:06,720
compute how much fuel we saved with

1050
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:10,520
respect to the separate production that

1051
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,520
is called primary Energy

1052
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:20,160
savings it is defined as

1053
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:23,880
the the ratio of the difference between

1054
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,520
what I would consume in a separate

1055
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:31,359
production what I actually consume

1056
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:35,359
in my co generation facility

1057
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,720
divided uh with by the what I consumed

1058
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,880
with the reference production so that's

1059
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:43,400
this is the

1060
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:46,079
ratio and we know that in um typical

1061
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:49,039
cogeneration facilities allow you to

1062
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,559
save between 20 and

1063
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,720
40% so we're talking about large amounts

1064
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:57,920
that's why it is

1065
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,920
uh it is pursued and done

1066
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,280
so we know how much uh that's the

1067
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:11,000
overall

1068
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,559
savings but the problem is

1069
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:20,960
that in order to uh do that calculation

1070
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:20,960
for the home um energy

1071
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:27,160
[Music]

1072
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:28,480
um uh parameter uh is you need to you

1073
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,480
need another

1074
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,880
number you need essentially the cop for

1075
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:39,599
the for the

1076
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:42,359
heat it's how much uh the efficiency it

1077
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,359
says see you need you need this to know

1078
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:46,160
this

1079
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:48,880
denominator how much of the fuel which

1080
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:53,720
has been used in the cogeneration

1081
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:57,359
facility has to be assigned to the

1082
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,359
production of heat

1083
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:04,400
and there is some arbitrariness into how

1084
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:05,920
we Define this it there's no yeah some

1085
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,000
people claim there is a thermodynamic

1086
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,960
we'll see that exergy some the exergy

1087
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,720
people will will claim that that's uh

1088
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,440
the method that you should use but in

1089
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,640
our discussion we we show that that's

1090
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,039
not

1091
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,039
appropriate not

1092
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:27,559
yet so we need

1093
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:30,400
to uh Define allocation factors so

1094
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:33,440
suppose we have these allocation factors

1095
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:38,240
Alpha they add up to one so essentially

1096
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:42,599
it's the percentage of fuel that we

1097
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:46,440
think uh is been used

1098
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:49,599
for uh say Alpha W for the work

1099
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,160
production line and for the heat

1100
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,039
production line so you think of your Co

1101
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:58,240
generation facility as an equivalent

1102
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:01,880
separate production facility in which or

1103
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,880
or has having two internal

1104
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,440
lines if in fact if your combined

1105
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,440
production was simply that you have two

1106
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:16,200
separate lines then you would easily

1107
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:19,119
find what the alpha is you just uh use

1108
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:22,720
whatever goes on one line and whatever

1109
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:26,680
fuel goes on the other line

1110
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:31,200
but uh the

1111
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:35,000
combined heat and power uh is best when

1112
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:39,920
you don't have separate you but it

1113
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,799
is using the various levels of uh of of

1114
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,799
temperature at which your working fluids

1115
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,640
are to do what is appropriate to to

1116
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:49,680
reduce the irreversibilities and so you

1117
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,359
have a lot of equipment here in which

1118
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,520
which which play the game and uh and uh

1119
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,359
uh of

1120
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,440
both uh

1121
01:03:56,359 --> 01:04:01,359
they are both on the side of the work

1122
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,520
production and of the heat

1123
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:05,440
production but in any case suppose we

1124
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:10,119
have these alphas

1125
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:13,480
and okay then for example we could

1126
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:16,000
Define the separate efficiency so the

1127
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,000
partial efficiencies partial efficiency

1128
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,200
of work production would be the work

1129
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,559
divided by the amount of fuel only the

1130
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:28,640
part that I have associated with the

1131
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:30,680
production and and the cop for heat is

1132
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,599
the heat divided

1133
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:37,720
by the complt to add so that's the

1134
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:40,839
that's the energ the the fuel

1135
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:44,720
energy uh associated with the heat

1136
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:49,839
production and of course you can also

1137
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:53,000
compute partial primary Energy

1138
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:57,680
savings by

1139
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,000
comparing what the amount of fuel that

1140
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:04,359
was that is

1141
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,400
um that the amount of fuel that

1142
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:11,000
is used in separate production you

1143
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,559
subtract what you actually uh consume in

1144
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,359
your cogeneration facility so that's the

1145
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:18,359
numerator and compare it to the separate

1146
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:21,160
production so that gives you the savings

1147
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:23,160
of the cogenerate on con Co generation

1148
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:26,559
with respect to partial to the

1149
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:29,720
production of of of electricity

1150
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,720
and the same for

1151
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:35,520
heat okay and if you have that number

1152
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:38,640
Alpha q that number Alpha Q is what is

1153
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,880
needed for the home

1154
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:44,880
index efficiency

1155
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:47,200
index so in the beginning of cenation

1156
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,480
people reasoned

1157
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,480
uh and

1158
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:57,599
defined uh these allocation factors in

1159
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:57,599
this way

1160
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:06,000
they we call this uh method the

1161
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,000
incremental electricity centered

1162
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:15,200
allocation it basically says all right I

1163
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:17,640
in my cogeneration facility I produced

1164
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,640
this much

1165
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:26,200
work if I produced it in the

1166
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,079
reference separate production facility

1167
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,000
I would have with this reference

1168
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:35,160
efficiency I would have consumed this

1169
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,160
much fuel W over the reference

1170
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:42,720
efficiency okay so that in my

1171
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,440
cogeneration plant I produce more than

1172
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,920
that I I'm sorry I consume more than

1173
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:50,559
that fuel I consume

1174
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,760
F so if I subtract what I would have

1175
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,000
consumed in the for the production of

1176
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,640
the of that work it means that the extra

1177
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,799
fuel

1178
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,839
I'm consuming

1179
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:04,839
is attributed to the heat that

1180
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,839
I'm

1181
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,880
producing and

1182
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:16,160
therefore you would put a denominator

1183
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,960
here you would assign to that

1184
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,839
heat this extra fuel with respect to the

1185
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,160
separate production of the electricity

1186
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:27,960
that You' have

1187
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,960
done but this of course course is

1188
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:33,200
unfair

1189
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,839
because it assigns all the primary

1190
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,079
Energy

1191
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:40,359
savings to the

1192
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,880
Heat and zero to the

1193
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:46,920
work if it is true that microgeneration

1194
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:50,000
facility saves 40% of the

1195
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:52,559
fuel uh the benefit it means that there

1196
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
is a benefit of cogeneration and that

1197
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:59,039
benefit is it really all due to the

1198
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,799
production of heat or is it should be be

1199
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,799
distributed between the two

1200
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:12,799
products so uh

1201
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:18,560
another more balanced way of

1202
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:20,440
reasoning which to cover later is

1203
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:25,560
um to

1204
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Define maybe some uh local or state

1205
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:34,560
Authority Energy Authority

1206
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:36,560
defines or states in some standards uh

1207
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,560
reference values for the

1208
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:43,799
efficiencies of

1209
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:46,839
uh separate production of heat of heat

1210
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:48,920
and work okay so they Define some

1211
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:51,480
reference

1212
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,440
values and then they

1213
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:57,719
say all right

1214
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:00,159
use as a location

1215
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:02,000
factors the

1216
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:05,480
weighted uh

1217
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,679
fraction of what you would have consumed

1218
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,880
by

1219
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:12,279
producing the same W and same Q in

1220
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,920
separate

1221
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:18,319
facilities so this defines because this

1222
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,440
W over ATF is the fuel you would have

1223
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:24,319
consumed if you produced this amount of

1224
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:26,319
electricity in separate production and Q

1225
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:29,199
over Coop reference

1226
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:32,679
is uh the fuel that you would have

1227
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:35,080
consumed if you have produced that

1228
01:09:32,679 --> 01:09:37,880
amount of Q the same as your

1229
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,440
cogeneration facility in a separate

1230
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,279
production

1231
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,239
okay the the good thing about these

1232
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:49,880
allocation

1233
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:53,440
factors is that it distributes equally

1234
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,679
the primary Energy

1235
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:59,280
savings to the Heat and the water work

1236
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:02,400
so so that the primary average the

1237
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,480
the the partial primary Energy savings

1238
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:08,400
for work is equal to the partial energy

1239
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:11,880
saving for heat and it's equal to the

1240
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,880
overall partial Energy

1241
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:19,760
savings the question

1242
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:22,280
is what reference values should the the

1243
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:27,000
the authority

1244
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:29,760
select okay one method is to Simply uh

1245
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,800
do it arbitrarily or maybe do it by some

1246
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,480
logic you publish it and it stays there

1247
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:39,480
for some years then maybe you update

1248
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:42,480
that uh those reference

1249
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:46,199
values The Other

1250
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:50,480
Extreme is you

1251
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:50,480
select uh the

1252
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:56,280
exergy

1253
01:10:52,520 --> 01:11:00,159
reasoning so you say well let's use as

1254
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:04,679
reference values the best you could

1255
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:07,679
do namely the reversible

1256
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,679
processes

1257
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,719
yes earlier didn't

1258
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,400
reques efficieny

1259
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,440
of proding

1260
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:34,239
yes uh yes at the beginning uh certainly

1261
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,199
it was an easy way of reasoning it

1262
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:40,600
didn't require an authority to Define

1263
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:43,320
and also you didn't have the

1264
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:47,440
motivation the motivation came and this

1265
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:50,440
is how we came with this uh question and

1266
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,920
this is how U uh I'll give you the

1267
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:54,719
reference to a paper with with your

1268
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,840
advisor Professor gonan we worked

1269
01:11:54,719 --> 01:12:00,679
together on this

1270
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:03,159
problem because uh the utility which

1271
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:06,199
produces District Heating in braia came

1272
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:09,280
uh to us and asked okay we have a

1273
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:13,639
problem now because we are giving these

1274
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:17,320
numbers but with these numbers uh uh

1275
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:22,360
every apartment uh goes into the top

1276
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:24,760
class we are signing so low uh um

1277
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:27,440
consumption of of fuel to the heat that

1278
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:30,400
we are providing them that they are so

1279
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:32,840
happy they they are in class A Plus even

1280
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,800
with the windows open no so it doesn't

1281
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,480
make sense that's why they came and so I

1282
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:40,320
said we need something more and so they

1283
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:42,040
also after these discussions they also

1284
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:45,920
went to the European community and

1285
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:48,920
change the and have them change the uh

1286
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,920
regulations

1287
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:57,480
yeah um so the exergy the exergy uh idea

1288
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,199
is let's take as reference the best we

1289
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,760
could

1290
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:05,239
do and the best we could do is the

1291
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:09,800
reversible uh the reversible case

1292
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:13,440
so so what is the the best we could

1293
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,560
do in terms of

1294
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,760
uh

1295
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:21,239
efficiency for work

1296
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:25,760
production so if I

1297
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:28,400
have uh to produce this much work

1298
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,600
and I'm using a

1299
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:35,920
fuel with an

1300
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,920
xergy that is this much

1301
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:44,600
X well if there are no irreversibilities

1302
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,520
in my Machinery so it's irreversible the

1303
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,520
exergy gets all transformed there is no

1304
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,520
loss of exergy so the exergy of the fuel

1305
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:55,920
goes all into exergy of the product so

1306
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,480
it's one to one so w Max

1307
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:01,920
or let say

1308
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:04,040
rev is equal to the exergy of the fuel

1309
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,440
but the exergy of the fuel we said is

1310
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:09,800
approximately equal to the heating value

1311
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,800
let's call it qf to

1312
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:16,239
simplify so that means that this

1313
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,360
Machinery uh reversible Machinery that

1314
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:22,440
would do that has a first low efficiency

1315
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,679
which is what we call AA

1316
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:27,800
W ref

1317
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,800
which is the

1318
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,800
work

1319
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:43,040
produced uh first law so it's uh divided

1320
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:45,920
by the the heat the heating value of the

1321
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:50,120
fuel the energy that has been consumed

1322
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:53,600
but this is also approximately equal to

1323
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:57,000
uh to the exy of the fuel and as you see

1324
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,000
here this is approxim

1325
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:09,400
one

1326
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,400
whereas the same story if I use my

1327
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:17,679
fuel and I want to produce

1328
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:17,679
heat uh at the temperature

1329
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,840
TQ the

1330
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:28,239
exergy of that heat is this and if I

1331
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:32,639
have no

1332
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:36,320
reversibility all that goes into

1333
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:36,320
this so the

1334
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:41,440
AA um let's call it

1335
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:48,199
cop would be the would be the the

1336
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:55,520
Q divided by the

1337
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:59,280
energy of the fuel because cop is a

1338
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,280
first law idea so uh the energy of of

1339
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:07,560
the

1340
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:07,560
fuel and the energy of the fuel is um is

1341
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:18,000
qf but

1342
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,719
qf again is

1343
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,719
approximately

1344
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:23,719
x f

1345
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,960
so this is

1346
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:32,400
Q divided by the the ex the exit gets

1347
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:37,080
all transformed in that so here in the

1348
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,080
denominator I put q1 minus t over

1349
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:46,239
TQ okay so the cop is one of the over

1350
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,239
the caral

1351
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:53,960
coefficient calculated at the

1352
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:56,840
temperature of our uh production heat

1353
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,840
production

1354
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,080
so you certainly can do that so I'll

1355
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,280
give you a numerical example for this in

1356
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,280
a

1357
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:11,800
moment so here is uh here's the

1358
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:19,040
paper with Professor Gan and another

1359
01:17:15,719 --> 01:17:22,520
colleague of mine in bracia Pao

1360
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:25,159
yora with which we sort of addressed the

1361
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:28,120
issue

1362
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:32,600
and acknowledge that there is

1363
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:37,520
no correct way to do it you have to

1364
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:39,440
uh uh it's hand waving and it's um it's

1365
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,440
arbitrary in some

1366
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,440
sense

1367
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:48,639
but

1368
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:51,080
uh the idea that we introduced was this

1369
01:17:48,639 --> 01:17:54,600
uh

1370
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,920
okay suppose even suppose this this this

1371
01:17:54,600 --> 01:18:00,960
Lo local

1372
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:03,960
Authority uh has to decide what uh

1373
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:08,120
efficiencies to reference efficiency to

1374
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,880
to to set uh what what Criterion should

1375
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,440
they

1376
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:15,080
use well they would

1377
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:17,679
look at their local area and by local

1378
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:22,080
area it could be a small District it

1379
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:25,400
could be a town uh it could be State

1380
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,320
could be a nation it could be uh

1381
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:30,840
uh Europe no it could it could do this

1382
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:34,199
at various levels because there are

1383
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:37,080
standards local standards and so

1384
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:41,120
on in in the homework I'll give you

1385
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,880
reference to a an European Standard

1386
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:47,560
which was

1387
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:51,120
2007 uh which had the the the issue

1388
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:54,920
so I frankly I didn't follow up but I'm

1389
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:57,320
sure that they've improved a lot with

1390
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,320
recent

1391
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,840
standards so that means that the problem

1392
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:05,560
is of Interest also at the European

1393
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:10,840
level which is

1394
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:10,840
congregation the community of several

1395
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,159
Nations okay so you you do

1396
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:21,639
take take the data that come from

1397
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:25,480
various facilities in your local area

1398
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:29,080
every facility is always um um obliged

1399
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:31,239
to uh communicate to to some energy

1400
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:35,639
Authority their consumptions and their

1401
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:35,639
Productions yearly at least

1402
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:43,719
yearly and and so take those

1403
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,520
data and look at your um

1404
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:48,719
overall

1405
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:52,760
system as a cogeneration system because

1406
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,760
after all it produces work and

1407
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:01,639
heat and therefore

1408
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:01,639
and you know how much fuel has been uh

1409
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:08,040
used for each of

1410
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,199
them so

1411
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,280
uh if

1412
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:29,639
I okay so if I have a

1413
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:32,280
assigned a value for the allocation

1414
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:34,440
factors like Alpha W and Alpha Q so if

1415
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:36,600
I'm the authority I decided these

1416
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:40,480
numbers with these

1417
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:42,480
numbers those who have combined heat and

1418
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:46,400
power facilities have used them in order

1419
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:49,960
to to compute their own um partial

1420
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:53,760
efficiencies so they will tell me how

1421
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:58,360
much fuel they have used or his behind

1422
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,360
this work and how much is behind the

1423
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,719
heat so I compute the overall uh

1424
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,920
efficiency for the heat production and

1425
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:11,800
for the work production for the local

1426
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,800
facility I mean for the local

1427
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:21,400
area but then I can also apply my

1428
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:24,199
same uh rules or or allocation

1429
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:26,000
coefficients allocation fractions to the

1430
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:27,560
local

1431
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,719
area

1432
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:34,800
viewed overall as an overall com

1433
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:36,679
combined heaten power

1434
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,120
facility

1435
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:43,360
and if I have

1436
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:47,480
given the correct values of

1437
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,480
alpha I should get the same

1438
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:53,310
number whether I look at it locally with

1439
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,639
small

1440
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:58,320
[Music]

1441
01:21:54,639 --> 01:22:03,000
facilities or the overall facility or

1442
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:05,679
overall local area system okay so that

1443
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,679
was

1444
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:14,480
uh uh that was the method that we

1445
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:17,920
have provided and here's an

1446
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,920
example with some

1447
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:24,760
numbers so suppose we have a local area

1448
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:27,000
and suppose that we have a separate

1449
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:30,679
production

1450
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,679
facilities that have a

1451
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,120
52% efficiency for energy for

1452
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:40,719
electricity

1453
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:44,719
and 90% so 0.9

1454
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:47,639
cop for the production of heat like

1455
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,639
industrial

1456
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:56,560
boilers and here is a the combined heat

1457
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:00,199
and power plant is a is a combined

1458
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:03,600
cycle this is also a back back um

1459
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:06,040
pressure steam turbine data but I'm I'm

1460
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,000
going to discuss only this one and these

1461
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,840
are two parameters that characterize a

1462
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,760
combined cycle so it's the ratio of the

1463
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:15,560
work to the heat that is

1464
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,560
produced and

1465
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:19,360
the first LW

1466
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,800
efficiency so 778

1467
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:32,600
so suppose

1468
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:37,639
that the reference volumes are taken

1469
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:42,040
uh as the values of the uh separate

1470
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:44,800
Productions in my local area 52 and

1471
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:46,920
90 here are the numbers that so look at

1472
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:50,159
just the first line here are the numbers

1473
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:52,400
that come out with the three methods

1474
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:56,120
that we discussed so far so the

1475
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,120
electricity centered

1476
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:04,199
gives H keeps uh essentially the same

1477
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:06,920
efficiency for the electricity as

1478
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:08,800
separate production because and it gives

1479
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,159
all the advantage to the heat so it

1480
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:15,080
would make it appear that you are

1481
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:20,040
producing heat with a cop of

1482
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:25,600
354 that created that problem that uh I

1483
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:28,280
told you of um and um

1484
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,840
unfair

1485
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:34,600
and

1486
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,600
unacceptable to much advantage to to the

1487
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,800
heat in a sense if you kept that

1488
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,440
everybody would want the district

1489
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:49,000
heating so it will be a fight uh to have

1490
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:52,280
the your houses to be District

1491
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:56,119
heated if you do the exergy which is the

1492
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:56,119
Other Extreme

1493
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:02,320
method okay the electricity

1494
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:05,679
efficiency goes

1495
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,199
down and the cop is still very

1496
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:10,840
high if you use this the separate

1497
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:15,520
production method with these

1498
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,520
references this gets more

1499
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:22,719
reasonable what's reasonable is that um

1500
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:25,040
there is an increment in the separate

1501
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:28,600
production I mean in the partial

1502
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:30,639
efficiency for work and

1503
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:35,040
also the same

1504
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:36,679
increment uh for heat so if you if going

1505
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:41,440
from 52 to

1506
01:25:36,679 --> 01:25:43,560
63 uh is say an increment of um maybe

1507
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:47,920
what

1508
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:55,239
20% uh well also going from 90

1509
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:58,480
to 10 109 109 is 20% so you have uh

1510
01:25:55,239 --> 01:26:01,840
evenly distributed youve treated equally

1511
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:06,000
work and heat so you gave to both work

1512
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:11,159
and heat the same um weight or the same

1513
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,159
advantage of U the co

1514
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:18,560
generation but the problem what the

1515
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:20,239
problem yeah a problem is that when you

1516
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,080
now

1517
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:25,639
compute for your local

1518
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:30,679
area uh

1519
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:30,679
the uh local average of the

1520
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,239
efficiencies you don't

1521
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,360
find the same

1522
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:47,920
values for in this example here suppose

1523
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:50,360
you have uh so you have to Define uh how

1524
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,679
important is cogeneration is in your

1525
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:56,119
local

1526
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:59,560
area and so you you have to Define an

1527
01:26:56,119 --> 01:27:04,360
electric index which is 50% in this

1528
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:06,639
case that means that heat

1529
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:08,960
is like

1530
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:12,520
twice the

1531
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:15,080
work and also that your cogeneration

1532
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,440
facilities cover 40% of the heat

1533
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:20,199
production in the local area okay with

1534
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,320
these numbers you you can compute the

1535
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:24,719
local

1536
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:27,119
averages and uh these local average are

1537
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,760
62 for work and

1538
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:30,760
96.8 for

1539
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:39,360
heat for work it's not too far but for

1540
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:41,239
heat it's far because 109 is very far

1541
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,880
from

1542
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:46,719
96

1543
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:50,840
so what we proposed is simply to say all

1544
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:54,400
right let's use the local areas numbers

1545
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:56,600
and use them as reference

1546
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:02,800
so if I use them as

1547
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:02,800
reference I get uh of course numbers

1548
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:12,400
change and the local numbers get

1549
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:16,920
closer but not yet I have to keep doing

1550
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:18,840
so if I iterate at a certain stage I get

1551
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:25,800
oops I get

1552
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:25,800
to a place in which um

1553
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:33,880
yeah in principle I should get that

1554
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:37,199
these these two numbers become

1555
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,199
equal and

1556
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:43,920
also so there's no more Improvement and

1557
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:46,840
so the the local area so the

1558
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:49,440
the yeah the local areas and I'm not

1559
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:52,239
sure um these numbers are really correct

1560
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:55,320
because this 90.8 is is

1561
01:28:52,239 --> 01:29:00,560
92 uh so there may be something wrong in

1562
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:03,360
this uh numbers because the idea was I

1563
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,560
believe but I may be wrong now so you

1564
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:09,679
check it check check on me because uh

1565
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:11,119
that this should become almost equal in

1566
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:15,239
the long

1567
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:16,239
run all right so that's that's the uh

1568
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:17,960
that's the

1569
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:22,040
idea

1570
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:25,280
uh but story is not finished because now

1571
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,280
this same

1572
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:32,239
uh issue of allocation comes up also

1573
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,840
when you have a

1574
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:37,199
hybrid

1575
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:39,760
uh facilities hybrid power

1576
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:42,560
plants for

1577
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:45,679
example you know that

1578
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,480
um we could use solar

1579
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:50,040
energy

1580
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:55,360
for

1581
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:58,679
uh for heating water

1582
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:03,400
and one way of course so you have solar

1583
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:03,400
energy and suppose you have one of

1584
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:17,159
those parabolic mirrors that uh Focus

1585
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,159
the solar energy onto a

1586
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:26,239
pipe and in this pipe you run

1587
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:29,199
um water or you r run a mixture of

1588
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:32,560
molten Souls so that you can go higher

1589
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:36,119
temperatures or you got you run dimal

1590
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:40,119
oil so that it doesn't boil so you R run

1591
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:43,280
a fluid that takes up that that

1592
01:30:40,119 --> 01:30:46,159
heat depending on what fluid you use you

1593
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,159
can reach different

1594
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:52,639
temperatures for example

1595
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:54,480
with air and

1596
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:57,679
water uh

1597
01:30:54,480 --> 01:31:01,040
you can you can go uh

1598
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:03,920
maybe if you pressurize it you can go

1599
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:07,920
120 degrees

1600
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:11,040
C maybe higher but you have to go higher

1601
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,360
pressures with dimal oils you can go up

1602
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,920
to

1603
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:19,000
300 350 because then the at higher

1604
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:22,360
temperatures the oil disg gregates and

1605
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:24,600
so you reach some technological limits

1606
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:27,760
there molten Souls you can can reach

1607
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:33,560
maybe 500

1608
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:35,920
550 so people have built uh power plants

1609
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:37,000
with this idea of concentrating solar

1610
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:42,520
energy

1611
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:45,239
these mirrors follow the Sun so that you

1612
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:48,040
use it

1613
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:51,920
efficiently there are other um

1614
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:57,440
architectures of similar ideas like you

1615
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:59,159
have lots of uh mirrors on on your field

1616
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:05,080
and there is a

1617
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:05,080
tower and your pipe is there so the

1618
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:13,520
sunlight with the mirrors hits this uh

1619
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:17,560
hits up this

1620
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:19,800
um this pipe that is up there and there

1621
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:21,639
way that way you concentrate and you get

1622
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,000
high

1623
01:32:21,639 --> 01:32:25,320
temperatures and then the rest one once

1624
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
you have these high temperatures you can

1625
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:31,520
use your standard thermal cycle and

1626
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,600
convert thermal energy into mechanical

1627
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,600
and then electrical

1628
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:43,840
work so no problem about that uh this

1629
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:47,560
belongs to the realm of renewable

1630
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:50,280
facilities that uh obtain important

1631
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,600
incentives from States governments and

1632
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:54,480
uh

1633
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,760
um and so

1634
01:32:54,480 --> 01:33:00,159
uh those are very important because they

1635
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:02,159
allow you to pay for the uh equipment

1636
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:06,400
and some some of

1637
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:09,719
these uh helps are in for example here I

1638
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:13,760
gave examples of tax

1639
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:15,880
credits uh cash grants loan programs all

1640
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,880
sorts of different uh things and this is

1641
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:21,239
just only uh something in the United

1642
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,719
States all every country has his own way

1643
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:24,719
of doing this

1644
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:31,560
it's

1645
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,840
similar to what you do for photovoltaic

1646
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:36,960
uh

1647
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:39,239
um so the photovolatic is is a direct

1648
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:42,040
conversion of solar energy into

1649
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:46,520
electricity this is a less less direct

1650
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:48,679
it goes through heat uh and then you

1651
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:51,080
have a power plant and in the end you

1652
01:33:48,679 --> 01:33:52,719
also produce

1653
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:57,520
electricity

1654
01:33:52,719 --> 01:34:00,840
okay so what is the uh uh what is the

1655
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:04,719
problem the problem is that

1656
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:11,119
sometimes when you do these um power

1657
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:14,800
plants it is also uh useful to hybridize

1658
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:18,639
it in other words uh use this heat

1659
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,199
yes in your facility but you use also

1660
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:23,320
some

1661
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:25,719
fuel use that heat but use also some

1662
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,719
fuel

1663
01:34:26,679 --> 01:34:32,320
because that allows you to use the the

1664
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:35,400
facility more hours per year for example

1665
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:40,040
or maybe it allows you to increment the

1666
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:44,400
temperatures and improve on the overall

1667
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:48,719
efficiency or and so uh it's either that

1668
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:52,960
you start from a solar facility and

1669
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:54,600
hybridized using fuel or sometimes which

1670
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,760
also happen

1671
01:34:54,600 --> 01:35:01,040
very often uh you start from a

1672
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:03,679
traditional facility fuel based and you

1673
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:06,880
hybridize it by putting a solar field on

1674
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,880
the side to for example provide the low

1675
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,760
temperature heating that the fuel does

1676
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:16,080
in a less efficient way or do some other

1677
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:20,119
kind of integration okay so in all these

1678
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:20,119
hybrid uh uh

1679
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:27,440
problems uh the

1680
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:32,000
important aspect is that the important

1681
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:34,520
question is all right I I produced work

1682
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,520
electricity the question is how much of

1683
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:42,000
that electricity that I produce can be

1684
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:45,199
said to be renewable and how much is not

1685
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:50,320
because the renewable fraction gets the

1686
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:54,000
incentives the other not doesn't so even

1687
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:57,480
here we have a problem which is entirely

1688
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,760
dual to the one that we have discussed

1689
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:01,280
and that's that's why I'm going to go

1690
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:08,400
fast on

1691
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:10,800
this but uh I will ask you uh in your U

1692
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:13,280
homework which by the way this is a a

1693
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,760
heavier homework so is more is also more

1694
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,760
work at

1695
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:23,880
uh it's so it will have two parts two

1696
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:26,840
videos one with a with a problem on

1697
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:31,280
cogeneration and the other is uh put

1698
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:33,320
words in these slides about uh uh this

1699
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,159
part of the hybrid

1700
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:39,960
facilities

1701
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:42,480
so uh in any case the The Duality stands

1702
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,560
on the fact that in the previous problem

1703
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:47,880
we had the alphas on the left hand side

1704
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:51,320
here we have the betas on the uh right

1705
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:53,320
hand side which which so beta R is the

1706
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,119
renewable fraction of electricity so

1707
01:36:53,320 --> 01:37:00,880
beta R is the key is the number that

1708
01:36:56,119 --> 01:37:03,840
will give you access to these economic

1709
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:07,320
incentives uh also here you can uh talk

1710
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,159
about primary energy uh savings and also

1711
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,920
talk

1712
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:14,679
about um partial efficiencies where you

1713
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:19,560
put up

1714
01:37:14,679 --> 01:37:21,440
there um you see f is the fuel is the

1715
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:24,840
it's the hydrocarbon that you're using

1716
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:30,159
and R is the solar energy

1717
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:32,280
okay so um you again you you sort of

1718
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:35,760
think once you have this betas you can

1719
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:39,199
think that your um hybrid facility has

1720
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:41,840
two lines one is the one that produces

1721
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:43,199
electricity starting from the fuel and

1722
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,760
the other that

1723
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:47,599
starts produces other electricity

1724
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:50,599
starting from

1725
01:37:47,599 --> 01:37:54,159
solar and you want to do this

1726
01:37:50,599 --> 01:37:56,719
splitting so

1727
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:58,760
uh you can Define the primary Energy

1728
01:37:56,719 --> 01:38:00,400
savings with respect to separate

1729
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:04,159
production so separate production would

1730
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:07,119
be I only have one solar facility and

1731
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:09,800
one fossil fuel facility

1732
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:12,599
separate apparently they it is better if

1733
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:15,639
you combine them you get higher

1734
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:17,920
efficiencies um I don't have experience

1735
01:38:15,639 --> 01:38:21,320
so I don't have the numbers of uh if it

1736
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:24,639
is of the same order maybe 40% is is is

1737
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:27,920
too much but uh uh for sure there is a

1738
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:31,920
some improvement in some uh in in the

1739
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:34,360
overall efficiency also

1740
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:36,440
here uh again at the beginning and

1741
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:41,040
perhaps even still now because I don't

1742
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:42,679
know if this problem is evolved uh

1743
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,920
enough

1744
01:38:42,679 --> 01:38:49,719
um there is

1745
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:52,920
a there is one way uh that we call

1746
01:38:49,719 --> 01:38:56,360
incremental fossil Center where you give

1747
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:59,719
priority to uh to the renewable and so

1748
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:02,800
you said all right I use that fuel with

1749
01:38:59,719 --> 01:39:05,360
that fuel I usually produce this much

1750
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:09,840
electricity fine so the extra

1751
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,840
electricity is attributed to the

1752
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,719
solar but that's

1753
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:19,239
unfair because it gives a it doesn't

1754
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:21,960
distribute evenly the the primary Energy

1755
01:39:19,239 --> 01:39:23,920
savings so again you can use a a

1756
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:28,159
separate production

1757
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:33,119
um method like uh like we did for the

1758
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:33,119
other case and again you could use

1759
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:39,840
exy here only one point I need to uh um

1760
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:44,639
to to explain is

1761
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,639
that I use uh what's the

1762
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:50,080
exergy of solar energy that's a chapter

1763
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:54,320
in

1764
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:56,119
itself uh but if you You could argue

1765
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,520
that there are some papers I can give

1766
01:39:56,119 --> 01:40:03,800
you references to those papers

1767
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:07,560
um we also contributed some

1768
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:11,960
um a good number is this of course there

1769
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:11,960
there are formulas that get you to this

1770
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:18,000
one

1771
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:20,560
and meaning that you know energy coming

1772
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:25,320
from the Sun comes from a very high

1773
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,320
temperature Source the order of uh

1774
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:32,400
this many k

1775
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:34,920
Kelvin that so the photons that come

1776
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:37,320
from the Sun carry not only energy but

1777
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,320
also

1778
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:46,440
entropy but then uh there is a problem

1779
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:49,480
that you it gets to the

1780
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:53,639
atmosphere and you get to the surface of

1781
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:58,560
the Earth you get some direct lights and

1782
01:40:53,639 --> 01:41:02,199
some rays and some indirect

1783
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:05,159
through def fraction

1784
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:09,440
and

1785
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:12,119
yeah so so from the sky uh the sky has a

1786
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:15,440
certain temperature so there are lots of

1787
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:19,199
of reasoning that go behind the number

1788
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:22,000
like this and so again this is a chapter

1789
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:25,520
in itself but in any case the the

1790
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,520
problem here is is

1791
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,920
that

1792
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:36,239
H with the exergy

1793
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:38,480
method yeah uh you're using the

1794
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:41,440
reversible uh you're using the

1795
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:46,159
reversible heat engine as a as a

1796
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:48,400
reference and that is uh not feasible

1797
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:50,920
actually I see that the time is over so

1798
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,960
maybe we'll return just with few words

1799
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:55,280
at the beginning of next lecture about

1800
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,599
this because I there's still something I

1801
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:00,440
want to say that I didn't and it is

1802
01:41:57,599 --> 01:42:03,800
important also so hold on don't do the

1803
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:07,760
homework yet okay all right so I'll see

1804
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,760
you next time see you Tuesday
