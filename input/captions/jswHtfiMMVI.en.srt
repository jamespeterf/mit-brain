00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,319
Hello everyone and welcome to MIT

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,880
Startup Exchange demo day. Thank you for

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,040
being with us wherever you may be today.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm Marata Rodenstein, program manager

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
with MIT Startup Exchange and shortly

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760
you will hear from eight exciting

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,240
startups. They're among those that have

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
more recently joined our program and so

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
you can meet them all here right here

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,439
right now.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,279
Next,

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,359
um I will give a brief overview of our

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,719
program and then you will hear from the

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,800
startups. So as you might know MIT

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,280
startup exchange was created to support

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
MIT connected startups as they grow

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
expand and help solve some of the

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,399
world's greatest challenges and we do

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
this by fostering partnerships and

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
collaborations between the startups and

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
industry primarily members on the

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,600
industrial leazison program or ILP and

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,840
also the MIT innovation ecosystem and

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
beyond.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,680
The startups in our program have a

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
strong connection to the institute. They

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
may be based on MIT licensed technology

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,640
or founded by MIT faculty, staff or

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
alumni. And they also may be vetted by

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
some of our MIT peers including the

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,760
engine, start nano or CEL startup

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,760
connect plus.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,479
We have around 800 startups in the

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,799
program and they usually join at pilot

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,680
stage or beyond and they may represent

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,520
any sector and any geography. Here you

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
can see the breath of solutions of the

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,320
MIT startups and I've noted in bold

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,159
those that represent the startups here

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
with us today. Of course, we start with

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,200
AI and ML, big data and analytics,

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
sustainability and renewable energy and

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,960
life science and healthcare among

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
others.

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,040
So when it comes to value, everything

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,200
that we do is for the exposure of the

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
startups and for opportunities for

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
connection with industry. And we do this

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
in a variety of ways listed here and

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,880
also in a customized approach. For

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,280
example, we launch calls for startups.

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,079
We call these opportunities and they're

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,239
based on a corporate's priorities and

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,319
internal challenges. and startups can

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,239
apply on our website and if selected

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,239
they could work with you as an ILP

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,360
member to help you solve a problem that

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,319
you may be facing in your industry.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,720
We also host one-on-one meetings, demo

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,520
days like today, other webinars and

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,879
conferences that have a um component of

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,959
a startup lightning talk segment and and

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,640
an exhibit. And we also host workshops

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,920
and trainings sometimes in conjunction

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,920
with our MIT peers.

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
And so what is demo day? So it's a

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
virtual forum to facilitate corporate

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,120
interactions with the industry ready

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
startups in our program with the goal to

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
explore potential collaborations and

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
partnerships and that this can happen

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,480
sooner rather than later. It's a short

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,959
and sweet approach. And so the format

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
today will consist of eight startups for

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,840
four minutes um presenting followed by a

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
couple of minutes of Q&A and then we'll

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
jump right into breakout rooms. So

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,200
please join us for that where you can

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,599
engage further with the startups. For

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,640
the Q&A part, I ask that you please post

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,800
your questions to the Q&A button at the

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,319
bottom of your screen indicating which

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,560
startup the question is for. And

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,640
throughout we want to keep this dynamic

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,599
and interactive. Please use the chat to

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,319
connect with the startups as well. So,

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,319
and as always, of course, um connect

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,400
with us if you need help uh reaching out

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,319
to the startups. My email is right there

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,239
and also it could be via your ILP

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,080
program director. We have several of

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,040
them joining today. So, thank you as

93
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,560
well for being here. And a couple of

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,159
final reminders before we start. The uh

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
presentations of the startups are being

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,000
recorded. And also at the end of the

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,400
event, you'll see a brief pop-up survey.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
So, please help us with your feedback.
