00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm here today to answer a question the

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,640
question is why don't we use all our

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
brain cells well guess what we actually

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,080
do we just don't use them all at the

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,040
same time there are two major types of

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,719
brain cells the first are neurons these

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,800
cells are the ones we traditionally

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,480
think of as existing in the brain now

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,359
there's another type of cell in our

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,560
brain that we don't think about as often

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,560
those cells are called glea these Gia

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,439
are there to help the neurons do their

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,480
daily tasks so when neurons are talking

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,759
to each other they'll sometimes create

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,399
waste and Gia will help clean up that

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,079
waste the second example is we need lots

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,680
of different parts of our brain because

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,879
we do lots of different things with our

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,200
brain to help us walk we need our motor

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,000
cortex to learn and form a memory you

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,840
need a totally different brain area

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,160
called the hippocampus it's actually a

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,320
rumor that we don't use all our brain

24
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,000
cells we use them all we just don't use

25
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
them all at the same time for more MIT

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
