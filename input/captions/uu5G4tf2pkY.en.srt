1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,559
Hello everyone. Uh my name is Praimnat

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,080
Shari and I'm a post-doal associate at

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,759
the MIT Media Lab. And today I'll talk

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,960
about something that I'm sure none of

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,680
you have ever thought talked about

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,480
before. AI agents. Uh just kidding. So

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,039
uh uh I'm going to talk to you about

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
this project that we're working on uh

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,120
out of the MIT media lab that we call

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,440
Nanda Na Nda. It stands for AI agents in

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,880
a decentralized architecture. And

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,280
basically the question we are trying to

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,960
ask is how can we build the next open

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,399
agentic web? Uh so next slide please. Oh

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,399
actually uh how do I

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,000
this.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,239
>> Okay, perfect. Thank you. Uh initial

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,280
hiccups, but uh today I think uh I'm

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,080
sure like all of us have experienced the

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,479
magic and beauty that are these large AI

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,280
models. uh uh maybe worryingly so, we

22
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,439
are spending increasing amounts of time

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,720
trying to get Chad GPT and Claude and

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,040
Gemini to answer mundane to complicated

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,439
questions about everything in our lives

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:33,360
from how do I make that uh brownie to

27
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,000
how do I refine this uh letter for a

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,000
promotion or something like this. But uh

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
we are moving to a future with these big

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,520
centralized models uh that could

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,079
potentially if if sort of the status quo

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,960
reigns uh we'd likely move to a future

33
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,840
where there is one best model for every

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,640
particular task. One perfect model to

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
solve diabetes problems. One perfect

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,759
financial adviser or one perfect math

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,799
teacher. But the future we are excited

38
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,640
about is slightly different. that future

39
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,560
is decentralized and we are inspired by

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,360
what uh we as a collective experienced a

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
couple of decades ago when the web and

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,480
the internet developed. So on the left

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
side is the progression of the web and

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,360
on the right side is what we are seeing

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,640
with AI agents. So uh a couple of

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,840
decades ago uh we went from what we call

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,680
mainframes or PCs which are uh sort of

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
computers but that don't really talk

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,519
with each other to the intranet which is

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,920
a local trusted network of computers

51
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,760
that really know of each other so can

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,879
talk with each other already to the

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,440
internet and finally to the web the

54
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,120
amazing web that has made so much

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,519
possible. uh we see an analogy with how

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,879
AI is developing uh albeit at a much

57
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,920
much faster rate. uh we've gone from uh

58
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,640
sort of these AI models uh like chat GPD

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,159
that came up uh just a couple of years

60
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,959
ago uh to what we call agentic AI today

61
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,200
which is uh a bunch of these models

62
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,000
talking to sort of instances that are

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,239
already known to them uh in like other

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,400
agents other tools and collaborating

65
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,720
with them to what we call decentralized

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720
AI uh which just basically means it's

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,040
becoming increasingly easy for folks to

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,959
deploy their own AI agents using the

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,760
simplest possible tools like crew AI or

70
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,519
lang chain uh so that anyone really can

71
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,159
have their own AI agent doing a specific

72
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,599
task but these agents don't know of each

73
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
other don't know of the existence of

74
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
each other and cannot collaborate with

75
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,400
each other and that's where we envision

76
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,799
this future of an open agentic web which

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,959
we call Nanda how can how can a large

78
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
number of agents millions billions

79
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
trillions whatever eons you're most

80
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,599
excited by uh how can a large number of

81
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,400
AI AI agents that may exist in the very

82
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,239
near future uh collaborate across

83
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
organizational silos, communicate

84
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,840
seamlessly, navigate autonomously,

85
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,439
socialize, learn, earn and transact on

86
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,439
our behalf. Uh this future is not that

87
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
far-fetched. Uh if you recall the

88
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,759
previous side slide, I showed you the

89
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,479
progression of uh the internet and the

90
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
web which took a few decades. And on the

91
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,840
right column, I showed you where we are

92
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,880
at with AI, which has taken maybe 3 four

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,520
years. So we uh this agentic web may

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,280
seem uh ambitious to you but may not be

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
that far-fetched. So it's important to

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,759
start thinking about what it means to uh

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,759
have this future of an agentic web.

98
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
Uh I'll talk about more of these but we

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,320
think there are three critical pieces to

100
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,880
think about uh as we are trying to build

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,520
this open agentic web. The first is what

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,320
we call foundational pieces. What does

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
it take for an agent to exist on this

104
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,440
agentic web? Uh infrastructure like

105
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,680
registries, search, discovery,

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,000
protocols. Uh I'm sure all of you are

107
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,000
familiar with A2A from Google, MCP from

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,320
Anthropic. Critical components like

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,880
those uh uh security, authentication,

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,880
identity, important pieces that I'm sure

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,280
a lot of you here are actively thinking

112
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,520
about that are very critical for agents

113
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,400
to exist on this agentic web. Second

114
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,320
piece is what we call agentic commerce.

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,320
Once these agents exist on an agentic

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
web, what does it take for them to

117
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,880
complete a transaction with each other?

118
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,280
So, how do we establish trust and

119
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,080
reputation? How do we do discovery? How

120
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,240
do we do routing of agents? And finally,

121
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,759
how do agents value each other's

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,400
knowledge? How do I ask Jim's agent a

123
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
question without knowing whether Jim's

124
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
agent can answer that question

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,400
beforehand? Because remember agents are

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,320
very different from web pages. I can

127
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,800
read a web page and know what the web

128
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,000
page contains. I cannot read an agent to

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,840
know what it knows already. So knowledge

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
valuation is what we call it. And

131
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,319
finally, agentic society. How do a lot

132
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
of the agents come together and

133
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
collaborate to become bigger than the

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
sum of their parts? These are sort of

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,720
the research questions that we are

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,120
thinking about uh as we are thinking

137
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,160
about this open agentic web. Today I'll

138
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,560
touch upon three uh points uh very

139
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
briefly about this open agentic web. We

140
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,680
can talk about this a lot but I'll touch

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,840
upon why do we think this is a viable

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,039
future. Why do we think we are heading

143
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,199
towards this? What are the risks uh that

144
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
prevent an open agentic web and why

145
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,080
should you care about it? And finally

146
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,319
what we are doing at uh as part of our

147
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,919
group to make this uh slightly more

148
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,479
probable

149
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,479
uh of happening.

150
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,520
So first why do we think this uh egentic

151
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,880
web is likely to happen. So today uh

152
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,360
most of us use uh rightfully so uh

153
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,000
centralized big models like uh GPTs or

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,440
claude or Gemini uh to do many different

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,840
tasks. Uh most agents are wrappers

156
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,240
around API calls to these types of

157
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,880
models. uh and uh that that is one train

158
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,840
of thought bigger and better centralized

159
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,240
models uh that are general purpose

160
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,360
learners but can also be gotten to do

161
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,080
specific tasks. But uh we like to think

162
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,599
about an alternate uh potential path

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,720
which is the uh future of what we call

164
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,599
small language models. So instead of

165
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,199
having one large model that is generally

166
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,720
good at doing everything, uh uh recent

167
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,919
research is showing uh promise uh in the

168
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,440
future of many small specific models.

169
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,319
what what are called small language

170
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,879
models that can do specific tasks uh

171
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,680
with much much fewer parameters and be

172
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,759
deployed on smaller devices like cell

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,599
phones and other edge devices uh to do

174
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,840
their specific task that they are

175
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,919
intended to solve. uh these small

176
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
language models have already shown uh

177
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,520
pretty good promise and at specific

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
domains like code generation uh

179
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,160
working at much much smaller parameter

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
counts much much smaller footprints

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,639
while performing well at their specific

182
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,319
domains. Uh they of course have narrow

183
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,639
functionality but they allow for better

184
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
alignment capability, better sort of

185
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,440
guardrails to safety and all that kind

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,320
of stuff. And so with the advent of

187
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,080
small language models, oops, uh, with

188
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,440
the advent of small language models, it

189
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,040
is not uh, far-fetched to think about a

190
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
network of small language models

191
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,800
deployed on edge devices doing specific

192
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,560
agentic tasks building this future of

193
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,800
what we call an agentic web. So uh with

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,600
this sort of contextualization of why we

195
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,519
think this is not that far-fetched, the

196
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,640
next question is what are the kinds of

197
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,600
risks for this for this egentic web to

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,760
remain open? Uh and I'll explain what I

199
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,279
mean by that. But really again we need

200
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,519
to look at history. So uh not too far

201
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,800
from here where we are sitting right now

202
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,200
uh uh important work was done to build

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,640
what we call today the worldwide web by

204
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,120
the W3C consortium led by Tim Bernersley

205
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,440
uh and uh they did a lot of amazing work

206
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
of course not just them uh around the

207
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,040
world a lot of very important

208
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,920
technologies were developed to make the

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,760
worldwide web possible these core

210
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,040
components like HTTP HTML URLs browsers

211
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,560
uh these foundational scaffolding pieces

212
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,279
that have led to all of the revolution

213
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,800
uh from web 1.2 to web 2.0, cloud

214
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,720
services, APIs, uh everything has been

215
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
made possible by these fundamental

216
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,519
pieces. But really maybe the most

217
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,880
incredible feat was that this web

218
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,320
remained broadly open. Uh it did not

219
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,640
become uh part of some sort of walled

220
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,480
garden. Anyone can deploy a web page

221
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,680
when they want and of course uh there

222
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,760
are a sort of uh major players doing

223
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
certain sort of tasks like search or

224
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,680
transactions but the web itself is

225
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,800
largely open. This is not the norm. This

226
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,480
is as we have learned uh over time, this

227
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,880
has turned out to be the exception

228
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,160
because uh if you think about all of the

229
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,279
revolutions that came after maybe the

230
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,920
mobile sort of app ecosystem or the

231
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,360
cloud provider ecosystem, the tendency

232
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,880
is for it to become sort of a few major

233
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,320
players uh controlling access,

234
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,040
controlling uh services and that

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,560
certainly has its positives uh including

236
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,200
doing things like security or uh uh

237
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,200
associated aspects but also it makes it

238
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,519
less open and less vibrant. So as we uh

239
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,519
sort of move towards this idea of an

240
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,000
open agentic web or an agentic web

241
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,880
indeed the question is what can we do to

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,360
keep the agentic web open and what will

243
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,079
happen if we don't think about these

244
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,240
efforts. So an open agentic web is one

245
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,519
we define it as one with sort of open

246
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,519
standards uh uh open sort of discovery

247
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,720
authentication payment protocols that

248
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,920
folks can build on top of uh and does

249
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,120
not have barrier to entry for anyone to

250
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,720
sort of uh come on top of this. Whereas

251
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,959
a closed platform which is uh also a

252
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
possibility that can happen uh likely

253
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,240
what will happen is somewhere in between

254
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
the two where we'll end up but a closed

255
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,040
platform is one where access to agents

256
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,600
access to services access to platforms

257
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,560
is controlled by uh front-end agent

258
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,959
store vault gardens start coming up uh

259
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,200
opaque algorithms start showing up that

260
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:07,120
we don't really have much control over

261
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:09,600
uh and uh sort of uh this leads to uh

262
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,800
things that were maybe not envisioned.

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
For example, if you think about the

264
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,440
traditional web uh aspects such as SEO,

265
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
search engine optimization. I'm sure Tim

266
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,680
Berners Lee did not think about it when

267
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
he was setting up the world web and the

268
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,120
fundamental protocols because really

269
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
this is not something they thought

270
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
about. But with the benefit of

271
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,440
hindsight, as we build the agentic web,

272
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,839
these are things we should think about

273
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,480
to ensure the agentic web remains as

274
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,519
open as possible.

275
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,200
So really the call to action on this

276
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:45,519
front is the the non the tendency is for

277
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,040
these uh technologies to become closed

278
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,200
and uh as part of world gardens uh and

279
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,200
for a few major players to show up as

280
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,760
opposed to it becoming open and vibrant.

281
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,680
But uh at least it is worth putting in

282
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
the effort and thinking about what it

283
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,480
means to keep these open. what are the

284
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,639
benefits of keeping the agentic web open

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,079
and uh the as I mentioned b earlier uh

286
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
we don't have much time because this

287
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,440
technology is moving very very fast and

288
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
we need to keep up with it uh if uh we

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,800
care about keeping this open agentic web

290
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,760
open and with that I'll come to sort of

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,079
the uh third piece which is what we are

292
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,040
doing here as part of our project to

293
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,720
build this agentic web and think about

294
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,680
what are the components that are nec

295
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,839
necessary to make it possible, make it a

296
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,399
viable future and what are the research

297
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,279
problems that we are thinking about. So

298
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,680
uh the first sort of problem that we are

299
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,639
thinking about is uh interoperability

300
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,120
across enterprise silos across different

301
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,480
kinds of data silos for agents from one

302
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,480
place to talk to another. Uh

303
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,959
uh it's it's good to think about again

304
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,440
uh technology from before and we like to

305
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,680
think about telephone exchanges and how

306
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,399
telephone technology developed in the

307
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,839
past and what it means to build a

308
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,040
telephone exchange for the agentic web.

309
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,199
Today the agentic web already exists.

310
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,920
There are a lot of different types of

311
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,120
agents and agentic players out there. uh

312
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,760
MCP servers, A2A agents that talk via

313
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,839
Google A2A, agents on other enterprise

314
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
platforms. Your enterprise may have

315
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,800
internal agents to do certain specific

316
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,199
tasks. All these agents exist on the web

317
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,040
on the agentic web but don't really have

318
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,120
a way to talk to each other to

319
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,440
interoperate with each other and make

320
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,440
this sort of worked agentic web a viable

321
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,160
future. So uh to to solve this problem

322
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,160
to make this interoperability possible

323
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,040
we think of Nanda the project we're

324
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,120
building as sort of a quilt in this post

325
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,959
AI world a quilt that brings together

326
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,440
all of these critical components that

327
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,279
are necessary for agents to interoperate

328
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
across silos components such as

329
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,760
foundational pieces like registries

330
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
protocols uh trust components

331
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,519
communication protocols like A2A and MCP

332
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,079
that you may be already aware of

333
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,760
transaction pieces uh if you have heard

334
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,040
about AP2 that Google came out with

335
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,600
recently. Uh and uh of course more

336
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,399
fundamental things like agent builders,

337
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,160
uh data and tools, compute, all of these

338
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,839
things need to come together and work

339
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,920
together uh and fit in together to make

340
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,480
sort of agents interoperable across this

341
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,880
open agent web. And this is where we

342
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,240
view our role to ensure that all of

343
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
these pieces come together and think

344
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,480
about the problems at the intersection.

345
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
What does it mean to build the DNS for

346
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,880
the internet of agents? What does it

347
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,199
mean to build an agent passport, a

348
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,040
metadata schema for agents so that they

349
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,880
can autonomously communicate across the

350
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,440
agent equip? What does it mean for

351
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,360
agents to interoperate across silos?

352
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
What does it mean to build an adapter

353
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,160
for these kinds of these are the kinds

354
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,240
of problems that we think about to make

355
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,800
this interoperability feasible? So four

356
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,320
critical choke points that we are most

357
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,680
uh interested in at this stage to make

358
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,880
this uh possible. The first is what we

359
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,360
call registry. How can agents uh

360
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,880
communicate across silos across reg sort

361
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,199
of uh organizational boundaries uh to

362
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,759
ensure collaboration across these kinds

363
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,440
of silos while maintaining privacy and

364
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
sovereignty of data and all of those

365
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
important things. Second is what we call

366
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,639
passports. Uh what kind of verified

367
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,360
credentials or metadata schemas do

368
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,839
agents need for them to interoperate

369
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,920
across these uh organization silos on

370
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
the agent equipment. Uh third is the

371
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,560
interoperability piece building the

372
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,040
telephone system or the exchange for

373
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,839
agents uh across enterprise silos and

374
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,839
fourth is at a stationation. Once agents

375
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,160
exist, how do you benchmark them? How do

376
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,959
you certify them? How do you uh verify

377
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,639
their capabilities to ensure they can be

378
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,440
good actors on the agentic web or at

379
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,759
least deterministic actors as much as

380
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,520
much as possible on the agentic web. So

381
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,520
we are working and focusing on all four

382
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,760
of these components. Uh I won't get to

383
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,679
talk about all of this in detail but uh

384
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,199
you can I'll link you to our web page.

385
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,559
You can head to that uh you can check

386
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,400
out all of these links that talk about

387
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,880
each of these components. But really all

388
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,480
of this goes back to uh those core

389
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,160
research problems that I talked to you

390
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,319
about uh up top. Foundational pieces uh

391
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
the agentic economy, how do agents

392
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,039
transact with each other and the agentic

393
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,440
society. How can agents build something

394
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,600
bigger than the sum of their parts and

395
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,360
learn collaboratively together to build

396
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,697
a a sort of big emerging system across

397
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,760
this uh network of agents.

398
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,000
>> [snorts]

399
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,080
>> So uh as part of our group we've been

400
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
working on uh a lot of these core

401
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,679
technologies for the for building this

402
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,240
internet of agents before even these AI

403
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,080
agents existed. Uh a decade ago we

404
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
pioneered what we call autoML. We've

405
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
been working on privacy preserving

406
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,880
machine learning this notion of

407
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
knowledge markets as well as

408
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,080
decentralized agentic system for many

409
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,160
years now. And uh we are most excited to

410
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,799
bring all of these technologies and

411
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,320
capabilities to this idea of an agentic

412
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,200
web and put it all together to uh make

413
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,200
this a viable future. So the research

414
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,440
road map uh what are the problems that

415
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
we are most excited about and focused on

416
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,640
working on uh as I talked to you about

417
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,360
already foundational infrastructure like

418
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,320
indexes and registries uh decentralized

419
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,960
compute and storage interoperability

420
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,960
uh adapters and teaming. How can agents

421
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,240
form teams and discover other agents

422
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,559
across organizational silos? AGI what we

423
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,200
call knowledge pricing uh as I touched

424
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,559
upon briefly before which is how can

425
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,240
agents uh uh value other agents

426
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
capabilities before talking to each

427
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,240
other some kind of benchmarking for

428
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,960
agents mainly collaborative learning

429
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,799
learning across silos and marketplaces

430
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,200
all of these are we think very very

431
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
important problems to solve to make this

432
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,080
agentic web viable and this is a massive

433
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,840
endeavor there is like we are in no

434
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,760
under no illusion that we will be the

435
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,360
one to solve all of these problems. In

436
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,280
fact, we'll be the one to solve a

437
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,120
minority of these problems. But the goal

438
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,720
is to build a broad collaboration to

439
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,480
ensure folks like you from industry and

440
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,880
uh folks like us from academia work

441
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,280
together to solve these problems in a

442
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,600
way that they fit well together and so

443
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,679
that all of our work moves in the same

444
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,120
direction.

445
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,840
Uh we are uh excited to work with bunch

446
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,840
of collaborators across uh major players

447
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,039
already in the space. uh and uh uh in

448
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,679
industry uh uh and we are thankful for

449
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,799
their guidance. So that again we build

450
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,760
together and build uh collectively to

451
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,640
make this a viable future. uh as part of

452
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,480
our project uh we run many many events

453
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,720
uh and are fortunate to have had uh many

454
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,440
important speakers uh in different sort

455
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
of aspects of this field to talk about

456
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,280
their thought process on what it means

457
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,640
to build an open agentic web and we are

458
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,679
very passionate about keeping this

459
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,240
process open and collaborative and we'd

460
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,320
be very happy to have all of you here

461
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,640
join us think about some of these

462
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,080
problems tell me what you agree with

463
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,200
more importantly tell me what you don't

464
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,000
agree with and uh build towards this

465
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,919
together. Uh we also run research groups

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,080
uh uh uh constituting of members uh

467
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,440
across academia and industry. We've

468
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,159
written a bunch of sort of uh tech

469
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
technical uh reports and papers that

470
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,440
help us think about some of these pieces

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
like what does it mean to build a

472
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,360
registry for the internet of agents?

473
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,679
What does it mean to build a sandbox to

474
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,760
attest agents on the agentic web? What

475
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,039
does an agentic passport look like? All

476
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,600
of these are things that we've thought

477
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,760
about, talked about, and uh we'd be

478
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
excited to have you uh join us to

479
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,559
contribute to this.

480
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
Uh before finishing, I'll just give you

481
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,360
a glimpse of two of the things that

482
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,400
we've worked about worked upon. Uh uh

483
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,240
first is what we call the DNS for the

484
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,159
Internet of AI agents, the agentic

485
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
registry, and the second is what we call

486
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,039
a sandbox. The first question to answer

487
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,880
is as I touched upon the agentic web

488
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,240
already exists. There are so many

489
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,400
different agentic entities like MCP

490
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,400
servers, AI agents that already exist

491
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,799
out there on the agentic web but don't

492
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,440
really talk to each other. an agent for

493
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,159
example within Salesforce's agent force

494
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:42,000
platform may not be talking to another

495
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,039
agent within HCL's uh like agent core

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,120
agent sort of their agent platform or uh

497
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,840
such types of interoperability platforms

498
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,679
problems and so the question is how do

499
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,840
we build discoverability for this agent

500
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,000
there are two broad options one is what

501
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,600
we call a centralized registry a

502
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,159
registry that is similar to DNS

503
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,320
a a single source of truth that is easy

504
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,960
to maintain that lists out all of the

505
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,559
agents that exist out there. Uh and this

506
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
other option on the other end of the

507
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,320
extreme is a decentralized discovery

508
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,919
platform where there is no single source

509
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,799
of truth. All the metadata is

510
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,880
distributed and discovery happens across

511
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,240
this distributed ecosystem. Both of

512
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
these have their strengths and both of

513
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,360
these have their weaknesses. And we've

514
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,880
come up with our own solution for this

515
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,400
registry architecture for the internet

516
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
of AI agents that we call the Nanda

517
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,600
index. The goal of the Nanda index is

518
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,600
not to be the one registry for the

519
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,559
internet of AI agents. Think of this

520
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,840
more as a lean central switchboard. Uh

521
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,840
so we uh envision and we are supportive

522
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,880
of all the important players having

523
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,600
their own agent registries uh sort of

524
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,039
listing out their own AI agents uh

525
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,960
controlling their access controlling

526
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,120
their capabilities. Our goal is to

527
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,919
ensure that these are all interoperable.

528
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,679
Registry A can find and discover agents

529
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,360
in registry B, set up that

530
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,280
communication, and once that handshake

531
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,880
has been established, these agents can

532
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,679
talk with each other without ever having

533
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,840
to come to the index or our sort of

534
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,440
switchboard ever again. So that's the

535
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,960
interoperability goal with the Nanda

536
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,080
index. Uh we're excited to collaborate

537
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,840
uh with many uh academic players. uh

538
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,120
just like DNS had uh 12 core registries

539
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,120
uh that allowed for global

540
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,960
interoperability, we are excited to work

541
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,640
with top AI universities around the

542
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,280
world uh to focus on hosting and

543
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
building this distributed Nanda index to

544
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,520
ensure AI agent registry

545
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,840
interoperability.

546
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,840
Uh we are also interested in uh ensuring

547
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,760
interoperability across protocols. Today

548
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,080
there are many different communication

549
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,400
protocols that exist out there. All very

550
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,240
important A2A, MCP, NL web, NLIP, many

551
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
many important agentto agent

552
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,679
communication protocols that today don't

553
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,919
really talk with each other. And so

554
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,919
we've put in some effort to build what

555
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,400
we call the adapter that allows agents

556
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,280
from protocol A to talk to agents with

557
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,760
protocol B and ensure interoperability

558
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,520
across silos in that way. So it's not

559
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,200
just about agents being able to discover

560
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,320
each other. Once they discover each

561
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,760
other, they should also be able to talk

562
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,039
in the same language and that's what the

563
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,440
adapter aims to do. The third is what we

564
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,600
call nest or nanda sandbox and test

565
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,559
build. This addresses the last piece

566
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,760
that I talked about which is

567
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,840
addestation. Once an agent is built and

568
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,919
becomes let's say a citizen of this open

569
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,320
agent equip. There are so many things

570
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,320
that need to be verified. Uh what are

571
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,200
the capabilities of the agent? How does

572
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,600
it communicate with other agents around

573
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,679
the world? what does it mean to host and

574
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
resolve AI agents on this agentic equip

575
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,480
and many many more important problems

576
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,200
for this we've built this sandbox which

577
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,200
is uh an ecosystem of live deployed

578
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,039
agents on this dashboard every dot that

579
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,120
you see is an actual agent that is

580
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,520
deployed in that particular part of the

581
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,240
world across cloud providers across

582
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,360
agent builder platforms and these agents

583
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,840
actually actively talk to each other so

584
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,240
today if you go to nest.pronanda.org

585
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,919
or the dashboard for this uh sandbox.

586
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,799
You can see these agents talking to each

587
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,520
other every few seconds building traffic

588
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,520
and communication on this sandbox for an

589
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
agentic web. And with this sandbox, we

590
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,919
are very excited because we can start

591
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,720
thinking about many many uh sort of

592
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,520
problems that we need to solve as we

593
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
build this open agentic web. Uh how what

594
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,520
does it mean for this agent web to

595
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,279
scale? How well does it scale? Uh what

596
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,520
what kind of protocols do we need to

597
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,240
build for AI agents? both communication

598
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,440
and coordination. How can we solve

599
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,520
problems at the infrastructure level to

600
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,400
ensure AI agent interoperability? For

601
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,960
example, resolving AI agents, serving AI

602
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,720
agents across geographies and latency

603
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,000
problems for orchestration across large

604
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,159
agentic teams. All of these problems are

605
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,720
ones that can be thought about and

606
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,720
evaluated on the live sandbox. You can

607
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,720
actually uh this sandbox is live today.

608
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
Code is open source. You can take your

609
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,080
own agent and deploy it on the sandbox

610
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,480
and see how it talks with other AI

611
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,039
agents on this open agent equip. So it's

612
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,799
very exciting. Uh today as I said it

613
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,960
hasund a few hundred AI agents. Uh these

614
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,320
agents can talk across communication

615
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,360
protocols A2A slim few others as well.

616
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,880
Uh it hosts different index and registry

617
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,080
architectures. It is distributed

618
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,000
globally and really it's a means for you

619
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,080
to uh experience the agentic web without

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,240
uh having to deploy our agent out there

621
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,320
in the uh real world. So uh as I

622
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,240
conclude my talk uh I hope uh if there's

623
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
one thing you've taken away from this uh

624
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
presentation it's that there are so many

625
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,880
different problems to think about as we

626
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,440
embark on this journey from individual

627
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,799
distributed agents to this idea of

628
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,480
aworked agentic web registries discovery

629
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,720
intent mapping adaptive routing

630
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,200
observability safety control plane and

631
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
many many more things I'm sure a lot of

632
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,799
you are thinking about all of these

633
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,880
important problems so are

634
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:17,679
And uh it is important to uh work on

635
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,240
this together. Work on this with uh

636
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,320
urgency and work on this in a manner

637
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,640
that retains uh sort of uh openness as

638
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,440
much as possible of this agentic web so

639
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,200
that we can uh build this next agentic

640
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,600
web together. Uh usually in my

641
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,760
presentation we also have this platform

642
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,440
if you're interested to build your own

643
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,760
AI agent quickly. So you can go to

644
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,919
jointhreadn.org just to experience what

645
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,760
it means to have your own AI agent. It's

646
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,679
a very simple platform. You can loging

647
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,600
in via Google Oath and then uh build a

648
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,240
quick AI agent that's a digital turn off

649
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,799
yourself and talk to it and see what it

650
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,320
means to have this magical AI agent for

651
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,880
if there is anyone who's not really

652
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,000
worked with AI agents. But really uh

653
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,679
that's about project number uh we are

654
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
focused on building this open agentic

655
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,559
web. Uh I talked to you about our

656
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,600
three-phase research road map. uh what

657
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:15,520
it's not is some kind of agent builder

658
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,919
or one registry architecture or one sort

659
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,399
of communication protocol or something

660
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,000
like that. It's more about bringing

661
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,600
together this agentic web bringing

662
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,240
together all those critical pieces and

663
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,840
ensuring they work together. Uh most of

664
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,200
the things that I've talked to you about

665
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,880
is open source GitHub code uh documents

666
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
and reports everything is open source.

667
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,080
You can go to projectna.org and check

668
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,120
those out. Uh we also work on many

669
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,200
algorithmic novelties uh uh that you can

670
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:47,039
check out from our web page. Uh we also

671
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,880
run uh a lot of these seminars. We have

672
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,600
weekly meetings every Friday. If you're

673
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,159
an engineer and wants to test out our uh

674
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,159
sandbox and registry we run weekly

675
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,760
technical office hours every Friday. We

676
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,840
run bunch of regional chapters for

677
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
people to get together and think about a

678
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,880
lot of these problems because really

679
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
that's the goal to get all of you

680
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
together all of us together and think

681
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
about these problems together to ensure

682
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,000
we uh don't miss anything because again

683
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,760
as I touched upon initially this

684
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,840
technology is moving much much faster

685
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,480
than the traditional web did and it's

686
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,960
very important to think about both the

687
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,880
strengths and the challenges today with

688
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:29,230
that I thank you uh for your time and

689
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,230
have you take questions. [applause]

690
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,919
>> Do we do we have any questions

691
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,960
right here?

692
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,919
>> My let me know.

693
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,320
>> You're audible. So given that again

694
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,799
presentation was phenomenal but given

695
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,799
that you're speaking

696
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,679
I'll just do a quick for our virtual

697
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,320
audience. uh the the question was about

698
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,919
regional standards for interoperability

699
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
between these agents.

700
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,240
>> Absolutely and this will be a challenge.

701
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,399
So I think it's a bit of a chicken and

702
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,480
egg problem right now because uh as

703
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,159
you're aware uh if you think about

704
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,960
governmental organizations or regulatory

705
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,919
bodies there is no real regulation as

706
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,640
yet for uh agent interoperability or

707
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,919
what uh agents can talk about how they

708
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
communicate with each other. So it's a

709
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,200
bit of a chicken and egg problem. We

710
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,880
certainly anticipate uh uh there to be

711
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,679
interoperability challenges or

712
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,360
interoperability uh aspects that need to

713
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,640
be considered. Today we don't face them

714
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,159
as you touched upon uh because actually

715
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
there is one chance even before that

716
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,600
even if we don't think about like

717
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,279
regional interoperability challenges

718
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,679
there is already like let's say

719
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,399
organizational interoperability but even

720
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,520
intraoperability challenges today uh

721
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,960
like uh big organizations uh as all of

722
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,799
you may already know I may be speaking

723
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,799
to the choir here but uh big

724
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,039
organizations may have their own agents

725
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,279
within their company but across like

726
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,600
verticals that don't talk to each other

727
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,760
at that level. So those are the sort of

728
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,760
challenges that we are seeing today and

729
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,200
trying to solve and of course there are

730
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,760
many aspects to solving those

731
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,480
challenges. first is forget about all

732
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,960
the security risks and uh all of those

733
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,399
types of problems but first enable that

734
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,320
discoverability and communication right

735
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,279
and that's what I talked about with the

736
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,200
uh registry switchboard and A2 uh sort

737
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,080
of protocol interoperability then come

738
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,399
the security challenges the guardrails

739
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,919
all at the intraorganizational level and

740
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,000
then we'll think about the inter and

741
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,600
then certainly at some point we'll have

742
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,159
to think about the regulatory challenges

743
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,399
as well but uh it's a bit of a moving

744
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,640
target right now and we are moving up

745
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,880
the levels if that makes sense.

746
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
>> Uh we have a question in the back here.

747
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
>> Quick question regarding community

748
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,200
alignment. How are you thinking on on

749
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,919
gain alignment from the community to

750
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,080
start using

751
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,799
>> I have to be quick Mario here to start

752
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,880
using the the

753
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,679
all these project the the network system

754
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,600
because at the you have on on one side

755
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,399
you could have chaos with a lot of

756
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,000
individual efforts creating a agents

757
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,080
without a particular framework or

758
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,132
protocol but you're you're trying to

759
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,840
build this network with a

760
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:24,000
[clears throat] order framework. How do

761
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,080
you how are you seeing to bring them on

762
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,039
board to to get gain adoption and make

763
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,840
it a standard board?

764
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,320
>> Yeah, I think uh it's exciting because I

765
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,000
think as you know a lot of the big

766
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,000
players are also thinking about these

767
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,480
problems in tech. For example, Google is

768
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,120
building this A2A protocol for agentto

769
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,039
agent communication. Cisco uh as part of

770
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,039
their agency project whom we collaborate

771
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,480
a lot with as well are also thinking

772
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,799
about some of these pieces like how to

773
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
build registries how to ensure agent

774
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,799
discovery and interoperability across

775
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,200
these large networks. So and we talked

776
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,120
to a bunch of bunch of companies as well

777
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,840
some of them were listed on the slides

778
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,840
and uh I think what we are hearing is

779
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,919
it's not a question of if but a question

780
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,760
of when. Of course there are a lot of

781
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,159
challenges to solve along the way. I

782
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,519
know a lot of uh organizations are also

783
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,399
currently thinking about things like

784
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,000
guardrails or intraorganization agent

785
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,799
interoperability as I was touching upon

786
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,600
here but really it's a question of when

787
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,039
not if uh if I said that the other way

788
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,360
around earlier but it's a question of

789
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:28,399
when not if and so uh people are sort of

790
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,760
excited about this uh and which is why

791
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,120
it's sort of important to build

792
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,360
collaboratively so ensure that agent

793
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,559
builders are working together with

794
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,399
people who are building communication

795
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,559
protocols or registry architectures and

796
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,000
ensure they all work together properly.

797
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,600
>> Okay, we're out of time, but we're going

798
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,240
to squeeze in one more quick question.

799
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,039
>> Okay. Uh how much of the architecture is

800
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,880
based on the assumption that the AI will

801
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:56,799
go towards a tiny agent and will it work

802
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,000
with with independent agents build on

803
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,760
bigger AIs?

804
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,159
>> Yeah, none of the architecture is

805
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,519
predicated on that assumption. uh the

806
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,039
only thing that is predicated on that

807
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,240
assumption is let's say our estimation

808
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,079
of scale for example let's so if you saw

809
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,359
my slide was very ambitious at the

810
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,760
beginning and it said there'll be

811
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,879
trillions of AI agents so if that h that

812
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,320
is predicated on there being edge agents

813
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,560
and actually that's not very farfetched

814
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,960
for example my phone today has it's like

815
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,919
a Google pixel and it has some AI model

816
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,760
that it runs locally I've been told so

817
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,119
it's not that farfetched but none of the

818
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,000
architecture is predicated on that

819
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,119
assumption for sure Great. Well, let's

820
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,520
hear it for Prauma.

821
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,520
>> Thank you so much.
