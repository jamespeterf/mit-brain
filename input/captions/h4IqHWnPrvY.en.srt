1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
Yes. So, I'm very excited uh today to

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,639
introduce a speaker, Jennifer Lipinot

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,719
Schwarz. Um Jennifer is currently the

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,440
senior group lead and head of 4D

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,000
cellular physiology at the HHMI's

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,640
Genealia Research Campus and her group

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
focuses on using live cell imaging to

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
study spatial temporal behavior of

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,000
molecules and organels across cells

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,800
across live cells. Um but before Janilia

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
she did her PhD at John's Hopkins um

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,719
where she looked at subcellular

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,960
localization of lysosal proteins and

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,360
then during her posttock at the NIH she

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,840
looked at novel dynamic interactions

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,920
between molecules and organels and their

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,719
structures um specifically the

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,399
endoplasmic reticulum and the GGI. Um

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,680
and then she established her own lab at

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,719
the NIH which has pioneered the use of

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,960
GFP fluorescent proteins um for tracking

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
molecules and structures in live cells.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,600
This is using FRAP techniques um

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,240
photoactivatable GFP super resolution

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,560
microscopy um to study a variety of

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,680
phenomena from protein dynamics to cell

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,520
cell fusion um yes so for all these

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
contributions she's been recognized by

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,479
many institutions um so she is the

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
president of the American society for

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,880
cell biology she was an elected member

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,479
of the national academy of sciences um

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,799
she's an academy of arts and sciences

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,880
fellow and uh she was awarded the EB

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,439
Wilson medal uh of the American American

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,960
Society for Cell Biology just to name a

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,479
few of the accolades. Um so with that I

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,560
just want to say thank you to Jennifer

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,840
for speaking today and uh I'll turn it

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,840
over to you. Thank you.

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,960
Thank you very much Tara for that really

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,600
nice introduction and thank all of you

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,439
for joining us today. Um it's very

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,200
exciting to be here. Um, I really

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,560
resonated with what Todd um spoke about

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,479
a couple minutes ago, um, in terms of

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,400
we're really being at a pivot point, um,

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,599
in, uh, in biology, in science, um,

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,120
with, uh, really, uh, I think what we

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,239
can all describe as an AI revolution. Um

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,760
certainly I've experienced it in my own

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,760
world of imaging as a cell biologist. I

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,080
will be telling you a little bit about

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
the way we're trying to incorporate

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,440
machine learning and AI into what we're

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,720
doing in my presentation today. But I

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,840
also want to uh just uh uh draw your

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,720
attention to at at

59
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,959
Geneia we really recognize this need for

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,840
computational um power in analyzing data

61
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,560
sets. Um so we're hoping you know all of

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,200
you who are postocs or uh moving on to

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
your next career after spending

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,239
wonderful time here at Broad and the

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,440
Schmidz center please consider um Geneia

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,080
because we are basically launching a

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,560
10-year huge effort in AI uh all aspects

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,480
of AI in terms of experimental

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,879
interrogation of um you know various

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,959
biological uh pathways uh to structural

71
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,360
work. Okay. So, today I'm going to be

72
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,159
talking about um exploring life

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,959
structures across scales through

74
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:34,319
imaging. And um I want to get right to

75
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,319
the thick of it, which is cells. Cells

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,040
are the fundamental um entities,

77
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:44,080
structures that all life is comprised

78
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,959
of. What's quite remarkable is the

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,080
ukareotic cell which as you can see is

80
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,840
this intricately organized system of

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,159
many different organels can give rise to

82
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,280
all of the life forms complex life fors

83
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,280
that we have on earth and what's

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
incredible is that this system is

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,799
conserved the internal organization of

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,599
the ukareotic cell is conserved across

87
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,760
all kingdoms

88
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,840
kingdoms of ukarotic uh

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,040
systems. A confederacy of subcellular

90
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,240
structures um that each have specific

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,000
cell activities really define those

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,479
membrane bound structures that I just

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,360
showed you in that EM image in the prior

94
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
slide. Uh this includes organels like

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
the ER and the gold sheet that are

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,440
involved in secrettory activities of

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,320
these cells. organels like the endoome

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
and lysosomes that enable these cells to

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,639
take up nutrients and other

100
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,400
macroolelecules from the outside to be

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,639
degraded and recycled. Um mitochondria

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
which are the energy powerhouse of the

103
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,520
cell, the nucleus where DNA replication

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,680
and storage has occurred. Perox

105
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,520
peroxomes where um molecules are

106
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,479
detoxified uh and finally this lipid

107
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,360
droplet where fats are stored. All of

108
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,600
these organels are interacting with each

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,440
other, communicating with each other.

110
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,600
And if we want to understand life's

111
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,880
programs, we need to understand how

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,680
these organels are working in different

113
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,639
contexts. So this is um basically one

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,800
attempt to really start digging into the

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,880
dynamics of these organels. Maybe if we

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,600
had the lights down, it would be great

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,360
for you to see some of these movies. But

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
um what we're doing here is

119
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,199
simultaneously visualizing six of these

120
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,520
organels um uh using a lattice light

121
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
sheet multisspectral imaging approach.

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,680
Um one of the things that you can see

123
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,320
from this movie is that these organels

124
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
are highly dynamic and they are all

125
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,960
interacting with each other in one way

126
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
or another. Now because these are this

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,479
is a three-dimensional

128
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
um movie uh where we have uh very high

129
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,360
res we have basically isotropic

130
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,319
resolution across all of those different

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,319
organels. We can come in and map out how

132
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,680
these organels are interacting with each

133
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,520
other uh at different times um across

134
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,440
the the um you know any particular

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,400
interval in the and the length of time

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,560
of that cell. Um and from that we can

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,319
create what what we're described here as

138
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,639
a matrix representation of the organel

139
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,560
interactum. Basically um the extent to

140
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
which these organels are interacting

141
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
with each other over time. And what's

142
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
interesting is that even though these

143
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,680
organels are highly dynamic where you

144
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,840
can see these contact sites um forming

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,960
and dissolving um dynamically at steady

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,840
state over long periods of time um you

147
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,919
have a conserved type of interactum

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,600
among these uh organels. And um those

149
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
interactions are playing critical roles

150
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,880
for these organels to communicate not

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,280
only lipids but also small metabolites

152
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,440
as well as um uh ions like

153
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,759
calcium. Now we can go from the micron

154
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,360
level which that lattice light sheet um

155
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,720
movie was showing you um to the nano

156
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,880
nanocale um using electron micro u

157
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
electron microscope approaches. What

158
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,520
you're looking at here is a whole cell

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:33,520
EM volume across a helila cell where we

160
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,960
are acquiring um we're basically milling

161
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,000
across this cell at four nanometer

162
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,880
slices if you will so we can and then

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,919
we're imaging each one of the um regions

164
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,240
that we've milled off um with structure

165
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,840
illumination I'm sorry with scanning

166
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,400
electron microscopy. Um so when you do

167
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,479
that you now start you now have the

168
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,120
ability to basically three-dimensionally

169
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:03,639
interrogate this the entire cell at the

170
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,400
nanog uh nanoscopic

171
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,560
level. So this is a one cubic micron

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,639
region of that heliloc that you just

173
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
saw. So it's the center of the cell. Uh

174
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,280
you can see there's the centrial. Um

175
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,560
what we we're looking at is just we're

176
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,840
just scanning through this one micron a

177
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,240
one cubic micron region. Um you can see

178
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,680
all of the individual uh slices

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,080
basically that we imaged. Um and if we

180
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,719
then reconstruct all of the objects that

181
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,640
we see in that cubic volume, uh you now

182
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,680
have the ability to divine define many

183
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,040
um bio uh cellular structures including

184
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,839
microtubules, the GI apparatus, the

185
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,920
endoplasmiculum. This is the nuclear

186
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,399
envelope. This is the nucleus. All of

187
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,560
these structures become visible at this

188
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:58,480
nanoscopic level. Now this was not an

189
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,880
easy task. um each one of the four

190
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,760
nanometer slices is only a a tiny part

191
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,200
of any particular structure. You have to

192
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,000
stitch them all together and that

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:16,399
requires hand annotation. So basically

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it took a single person um 7 to 10 days

195
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,320
to reconstruct this one cubic micron of

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,200
all of these membranes. uh and the way

197
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,920
they lay out over the over this this

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,839
volume. So

199
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,800
that led to an immediate problem. You

200
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,279
know, the cell is actually 7,000 times

201
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,040
this size. If you want to see all of

202
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,200
these organels at this scale of imaging,

203
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
um you're going to we estimated a single

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,760
person would take you 50 years to do

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,120
this type of manual segmentation. So

206
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,279
instead um at Genealia we set up a team

207
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,920
to do this using machine learning. Uh

208
00:09:52,279 --> 00:10:00,240
basically individual um annotators would

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,959
go in and annotate small subp parts of

210
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,120
the cytoplasm and then feed that

211
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,760
information uh to a a larger machine

212
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,320
learning um algorithm algorithmic

213
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,160
program which then would um basically

214
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,279
automatically search for the objects

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,279
that it had been trained on. Um so

216
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,640
basically as a consequence of that we

217
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,800
could uh really uh reconstruct very

218
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,839
quickly um up in this case up to 32

219
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,160
different structures within this heliloc

220
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,160
and we could compare as a consequence we

221
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,720
could do it with different cell types.

222
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,640
You can compare volumes uh organization

223
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,320
uh the way these organels are contacting

224
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
each other across many different cell

225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,680
types. And currently at Genealia, we're

226
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,240
doing this in much larger volumes, whole

227
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,000
tissues uh from uh various uh organisms

228
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,959
uh to uh look at interrogate cellular

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,120
organization um at this nanoscopic scale

230
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,880
across um cells within particular

231
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,399
tissues. Now this all sounds really

232
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,360
cool. Um, but it turns out that when you

233
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,160
look at these images, there are many

234
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,200
structures that are unrecognizable.

235
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,959
Like, what the heck is this? Um, and

236
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
there's also hard to find structures.

237
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
You know, there should be a structure,

238
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
but you don't know what it looks like.

239
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,399
And so, how are you going to find it in

240
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,320
these data sets? And so, that's where,

241
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,160
um, basically we're sort of trying to

242
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,640
push uh, new approaches. Um, so here's

243
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,519
an example where um just of a weird

244
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,839
looking structure that if you were going

245
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,200
through these data sets, you could see,

246
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,959
okay, I don't know what that is. That

247
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
doesn't look like a gold sheet. It

248
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
doesn't look like a loome. Doesn't look

249
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
like an ER. The only way that we have

250
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
been able to annotate all of the

251
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,320
structures that I showed you is because

252
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,160
we already know what those structures

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
look like. We have a hypothesis for what

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,399
they look like. This is something we

255
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,880
don't know what it looks like. Um and

256
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,959
the problem with our traditional

257
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,200
supervised uh learning strategy is that

258
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,200
uh the way we go about doing our

259
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,120
analysis is we manually annotate things

260
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,399
that we're interested in uh in a and

261
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,560
these things have to be fairly abundant

262
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,760
in order for the machine learning

263
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,279
program to learn it. Um so basically you

264
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,720
annotate something you're interested in

265
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:35,240
Eey or mitochondria losses uh and then

266
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,320
you uh use a machine learning to uh

267
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,959
basically interrogate the entire sample

268
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
and it will very nicely pull out all of

269
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,560
the objects that look like a

270
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,959
mitochondria or look like an ear. But

271
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,880
you cannot train it uh when you see a

272
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,000
weird object that's infrequently um it's

273
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,680
not abundant. Um so it doesn't you first

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,880
I mean you can manually annotate it but

275
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,800
you don't have enough examples of it for

276
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,200
the machine learning to be able to see

277
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
it within the system. So the approach

278
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,800
that um we're currently trying to do at

279
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,240
at Janilia is a selfsupervised learning

280
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,639
strategy where instead of um manually

281
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,880
annotating and creating training data

282
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,560
for machine learning algorithm, we're

283
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,000
basically having mach uh basically um

284
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,399
the computer train on the entire data

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,040
set. Basically put the entire data set

286
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,839
into its head. That takes a lot of

287
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,959
machine time intensity, but that's

288
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,000
better than having a human trying to uh

289
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,160
do uh do many different objects

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,720
simultaneously. But once you have um the

291
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,839
program where it has the entire data set

292
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,800
sort of uh at its fingertips, you can

293
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,920
then query it uh for different objects.

294
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,240
Uh and when you do that, it can pull out

295
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,560
weird looking structures um that are at

296
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,639
very low abundance. Now once you have um

297
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,760
once you've been able to identify where

298
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,360
those structures are across a cell or

299
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,199
across um cells under different

300
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,920
perturbation conditions in this case uh

301
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,680
this structures being generated when we

302
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,480
stress cells um you can then come in and

303
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,440
apply other approaches. In this case um

304
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,760
we're um uh using cryo correlative

305
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,160
electron microscopy to show that this

306
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,600
structure is actually an autofagosome

307
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,959
that has engulfed an ER exit site. Now

308
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,880
this cryo cororlative electron

309
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,839
microscopy is really really important we

310
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,920
think uh for really pushing our

311
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,639
understanding of the organization of

312
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,040
these cells because it's also valuable

313
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,360
for trying to look at the structure of

314
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,720
hard to find structures. One of those

315
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,040
hard to find structures are sites where

316
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,519
all secretatory and membrane proteins

317
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,279
exit the the ER. Um proteins secrettory

318
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,880
membrane proteins are synthesized in the

319
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,199
ER and they exit the ER at very

320
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,199
specialized sites that are created

321
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,560
through this machinery COP 2 coat

322
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,440
machinery. Um and the COP 2 coat in

323
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,680
vitro can create vesicles. So everybody

324
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,079
thought oh well let's look for vesicles.

325
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,920
Um maybe we can see uh uh COP 2 vesicles

326
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:29,680
in our in these big EM data sets. Not so

327
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,959
easy to find. Um but if you do cryo

328
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,920
cororlative um basically you introduce a

329
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,519
fluorescent probe for a component of

330
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,600
this COP 2 coat which you know is

331
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,560
defining that your exit site. You can

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,720
then at the light level image where all

333
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,160
those exit sites are localized in this

334
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,040
cell. And then what you can do and this

335
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,440
is uh we're imaging at cryo

336
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,440
temperatures. So we can now take and

337
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
this has been high pressure frozen this

338
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,399
cell. So we can now take this cell and

339
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,399
do our fibsim milling through the entire

340
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,800
cell uh and look at interrogate

341
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,199
individual areas where we have the COP 2

342
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,279
signal. And when we do that, uh, what

343
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,440
you can see, uh, this is, so this is a

344
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,360
little cubic volume here. We're we're

345
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
going to go up and down through the

346
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,839
different, um, four nanometer sections,

347
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,720
uh, that we've acquired through scanning

348
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,000
EM. Uh, and here's the spot where we're

349
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,440
getting this, uh, sect 13, uh, SEK 31

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,079
signal, I'm sorry, sect 23 signal. And

351
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,440
if we then interrogate that spot uh and

352
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:40,519
basically stitch together all of the

353
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:43,279
individual um uh uh images uh we can

354
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:46,240
reconstruct what these ER exit sites

355
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,639
actually look like and surprise surprise

356
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
they are not uh vesicles that are sort

357
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
of randomly uh butting off the surface

358
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,839
of the ER they are very discrete

359
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,480
structures this is the endoplasmic

360
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,160
reticulum uh there's a tight neck where

361
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,800
this sect 23 uh uh coat complex is is

362
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,480
operating and then spling out from that

363
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,160
neck are uh is a membrane labyrinth uh

364
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,919
sort of like a grape-like cluster of

365
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,600
membranes uh that have a very

366
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,319
characteristic uh uh diameter of these

367
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,039
uh sort of grapelike tubial extensions

368
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,280
as well as the entire structure. So once

369
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,919
we have knowledge of what this looks

370
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,120
like, we can then go back into our data

371
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,760
sets to be able to find your exit sites

372
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,080
in any cell now that we have the

373
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,000
signature of what this structure looks

374
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,520
like. Okay, in the remaining few minutes

375
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,360
I want to move to the atomic scale. So

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,760
we've looked at the micron scale, we've

377
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,039
just looked with EM at the nano scale.

378
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,880
Now we're going to go to the atomic

379
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,240
scale. and how uh imaging is

380
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,360
dramatically improving in this area but

381
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,440
also this is a total area where we

382
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,360
definitely need help through

383
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,160
computational biologists and uh machine

384
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:09,520
learning. Okay, so this is an archa

385
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,760
cell. Um but like every other cell on

386
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,679
earth it is loaded with these small

387
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,000
little structures uh that we call

388
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:24,400
ribosomes. So this is just highlighting

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,440
um ribosomes uh in a archa cell. Uh but

390
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,720
they are found in every ukareotic cell

391
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,919
on the planet because they are what

392
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,960
drive protein synthesis. So the ribosome

393
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,760
is the core machine of translation. This

394
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,320
is how proteins are being made. Um so

395
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:47,200
it's a macromolecular complex um that is

396
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,320
comprised of a large subunit a small

397
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,919
subunit uh and it's bringing together

398
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,200
mRNA

399
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,559
um that will be decoded uh and uh

400
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,720
converted into a polyeptide chain um as

401
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,960
a result of recruitment of these tRNAs

402
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,080
that are charged with various amino

403
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,320
acids.

404
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,799
Now, this structure has been studied for

405
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,679
decades in terms of what it looks like

406
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,840
at the atomic scale. What we're going to

407
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,640
try to do is to ask whether we can

408
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,919
actually identify these structures in an

409
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,720
intact cell that's been

410
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,799
cryofen and basically get enough

411
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,280
snapshots of this structure to actually

412
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,679
make a movie of translation at the

413
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,640
atomic scale.

414
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,880
Okay. Now this has at some level been

415
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,320
done from in vitro from um uh uh work

416
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,039
prior work where uh various structures

417
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,240
of the ribosome have been identified um

418
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,320
through single particle averaging. Um

419
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,280
what that has shown us is that the

420
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:59,280
ribosome indeed undergoes confirmational

421
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,720
changes uh during this elongation cycle.

422
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,640
the cycle for moving the mRNA through

423
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,640
that ribosome to allow a polyeptide to

424
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,679
form. What we want to do is to get a lot

425
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
more of these intermediates and stitch

426
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,360
them together to see if we can see a

427
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,480
movie of this

428
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,440
process. So the approach that we're

429
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,080
going to be taking is called

430
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,360
highresolution template matching. And I

431
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,160
want to uh shout out Peter Rickau who uh

432
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,200
was one of the pioneers of this approach

433
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,559
um together with uh Winfred Denk uh and

434
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,320
Niko Guggger at Genealia. Basically what

435
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,960
this approach does is um it uses a

436
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,280
highresolution noise-free template of a

437
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,120
macroolelecule and you search for that

438
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,880
macroolelecule exhaustibly in an image

439
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,200
um that's been acquired with minimal

440
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,799
electron beam exposure.

441
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,360
Now key things here one is we have lots

442
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,679
of highresolution templates I mean the

443
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,640
field is exploding alpha fold you know

444
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,600
millions of templates um let's find them

445
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,080
in a cell can we see these things in a

446
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,200
cell um so this is what this approach is

447
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,360
going to be doing now the the approach

448
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,720
is not dependent on the abundance of a

449
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,679
target or averaging which is what

450
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,600
traditional single particle

451
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,919
cryotomography approaches are using

452
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,480
those approaches. Basically look at

453
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,480
abundant structures, pull them out, and

454
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,960
then do single particle averaging to

455
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,799
look at various states of that

456
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,679
structure. We're not going to be doing

457
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,000
that. Um, we're going to just look at

458
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,039
the all of the structures we can see

459
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
using the template. Um, and then

460
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,799
basically we're going to use the high

461
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,799
resolution signal in the noisy images to

462
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,159
gain insight into the structural states

463
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,440
of the molecules. So here's the approach

464
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,080
that we're taking. Um cells are grown on

465
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,159
gold grids. Um they are then

466
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,840
high-pressure frozen. And so you can see

467
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,480
here are individual cells that are on

468
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,440
that grid. Um these are the cells that

469
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,480
are going to be examined. Um and uh

470
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:12,720
we're going to examine them with a

471
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:18,640
single image uh on our Creos electron uh

472
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:21,039
uh uh crym uh system. Now this is a uh

473
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,880
an image from the periphery of the cell

474
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:28,640
where the cell is about 200 nanometers

475
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,799
thick. So we are viewing everything our

476
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,799
electron beam is moving through moving

477
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,200
through that 200 that entire 200

478
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,200
nanometer section. This is the image

479
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,640
that we get. Okay. So you're going to

480
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,720
say wow what what kind of image is this?

481
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,559
I don't really see much in this image.

482
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,960
which is exactly what I told Peter when

483
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,000
I first saw this. Um, but he said,

484
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,880
"Look, the key thing here is that this

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,200
image has information. We have not

486
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
destroyed information with the electron

487
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
beam." One of the problems with

488
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,679
cryotomography is you're hitting your

489
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,520
sample many many times uh with your

490
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,280
electron beam. Every time that electron

491
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,720
beam moves through this tissue, it

492
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,600
destroys information. So, we have a one

493
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,360
one image we've acquired right here and

494
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,039
we're going to search it for a target.

495
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,039
And the target we're going to be looking

496
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,840
for uh is a ribosome subunit. This is

497
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,559
the large subunit of the ribosome. We're

498
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,120
going to search for it in every or

499
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,760
possible orientation that we can find.

500
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,880
This is what this uh ribosome uh

501
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,120
template would look like in our EM

502
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
image. If electron beam is moving

503
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
through this, this is what this thing's

504
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,679
going to look like. So, we're going to

505
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,000
uh simulate uh this structure. We're

506
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,600
going to rotate it uh in every

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,039
orientation and see if we see any

508
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,000
crossorrelation with anything in our

509
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,280
real image. And sure enough, we get

510
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,120
hits. Uh so that spot right there is

511
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,159
precise in here is where this um this

512
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,240
structure is. Um we are very confident

513
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:11,039
of that. This is the signal to noise. Um

514
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,120
showing that in this image right here is

515
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:18,640
this structure. Um now we can do this

516
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,720
across our entire data set. And so what

517
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,120
we're doing here and we can do it not

518
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,640
only for the large subunit of the

519
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:30,720
ribosome. We can also do it for the the

520
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,440
small subunit spec in in particular the

521
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,919
body and the the head of that small

522
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,760
subunit. So each one of these are

523
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,400
different uh molecular weights as you

524
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,080
can see. Um with that large subunit we

525
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
have much better signal to noise because

526
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,039
it's a bigger target. Uh we go down to

527
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,640
the body signal uh small subunit body.

528
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,039
It's um we still see very significant uh

529
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,960
hits signal to noise. The head is a

530
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,279
little bit harder. It's only 350

531
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,559
kilodolans, but we can still get um

532
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,919
signal. Um and we're doing this

533
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,080
independently. Um these are separate

534
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,320
parts of the ribosome that we are trying

535
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,960
to look for. And this is just a decoy

536
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,080
where we just put in a 2000 KD structure

537
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,039
that we know is not in in this cell. Uh

538
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,120
and we don't see any

539
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,640
anything. So this is where all of these

540
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,559
um subunits are localized in that image.

541
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,039
Uh here are all the the uh our peaks of

542
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,000
uh correlation crossorrelation. And if

543
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,720
we fit in uh the position of the large

544
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,240
subunit that we're detecting

545
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,000
independently of the head and the body,

546
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,880
you can see where all of these guys come

547
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,840
together in complete ribosomes. Some of

548
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,720
these ribosomes are not fully assembled

549
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,360
and we can actually see that. Um others

550
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,320
are fully assembled, but we're seeing

551
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,120
all of the ribosomes in this data set.

552
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,760
Okay. Well, what can we do with this?

553
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,760
Well, um, and this is just showing, um,

554
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,919
uh, how these things are arranged. I'm

555
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,039
just going to move very quickly to, um,

556
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,919
you can just correlate it onto the, uh,

557
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,480
image. So, what can we do to this? Well,

558
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,279
during translation,

559
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,520
um, the key, first off, the ribosome is

560
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,240
a machine and the way it works is by

561
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,919
rotation of the large subunit relative

562
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,559
to these small subunits. The small

563
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,799
subunits are swiveling. Large subunit is

564
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,360
rotating. The swivel motion is moving

565
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,200
the transcript forward by one codon

566
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,919
during polyeptide synthesis. Um, so we

567
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,120
want to look at all of the ribosomes

568
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,320
that we've seen. We want to know what

569
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,200
rotation swivel angle of these subunits

570
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,039
each of those ribosomes are in. And

571
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,320
that's what this is showing right here.

572
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,000
So this is a um plot uh where basically

573
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,760
we're looking at um the rotation um

574
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,480
we're we're positioning all of the um

575
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,840
ribosomes in a swivel to rotation um

576
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,960
plot. uh each one of these dots uh to

577
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,880
the far left uh is a individual ribosome

578
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,200
in that data set uh where we can map out

579
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,240
what its swivel angle is relative to its

580
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,640
rotation angle. And we can then fit all

581
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,039
of those ribosomes uh in a in a path. Um

582
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,960
and we're just arbitrarily dividing all

583
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,000
of these guys up into 10 different

584
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,760
states of that path.

585
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,320
um

586
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,120
which reflects the elongation cycle. So

587
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,400
basically we can from the data um

588
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,159
basically look at um the populations of

589
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,840
the ribosomes in each one of these

590
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,240
different states um uh we can also uh

591
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,960
look at their relative abundance um and

592
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,679
we can interrogate what these uh states

593
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,279
are uh during this elongation cycle.

594
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,320
Now some of the interesting things that

595
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:00,399
have come out of this is um

596
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:03,679
individual oftent times uh individual

597
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:06,080
transcripts shown here mRNA transcripts

598
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,279
um have many ribosomes associated with

599
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,120
them. These are called polyomes um that

600
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,679
enables efficient translation of this

601
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,520
mRNA. What we found was that the

602
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:22,000
ribosomes that are attached to this mRNA

603
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,919
which we call polyomes many of them are

604
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,919
actually in the same state of this

605
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:33,360
elongation cycle path. Um and uh that

606
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,760
was very very interesting um to see this

607
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,880
uh you can see that there um many of

608
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,919
these adjoining ribosomes are all in the

609
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,720
same uh elongation stage of the

610
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:49,279
elongation cycle. This is not

611
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,279
um colliding of these ribosomes because

612
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,960
we can actually go in and interrogate

613
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,559
the structure um of these ribosomes that

614
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,520
are neighboring each others that are in

615
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,399
the same uh cycle state. Uh they do not

616
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,039
fit with what has been described from in

617
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,679
vitro studies of ribosome colliding.

618
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,679
We're seeing a very different type of

619
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,480
interface of contact between these

620
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,960
ribosomes. So, what that's led us to

621
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,000
speculate is that these ribosomes

622
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,559
aligned along the mRNA are actually

623
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,720
synchronized in terms of their um their

624
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,200
movement. Much like um if you were on a

625
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,799
rowing team, you have if you're going to

626
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,559
row effectively, you're going to be

627
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,919
synchronized with these motions. And

628
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,559
that's what we think these ribosomes

629
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,919
might be doing. Okay, I only have a

630
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,320
couple more minutes, so I'm going to go

631
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,559
really fast to get to um the movie. Um

632
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,320
but basically uh one of the things you

633
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,880
can do is and this is really important

634
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,840
is you can reconstruct molecules that

635
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,840
are around these ribosomes at different

636
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,679
states of the elongation cycle. And this

637
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,640
is I'll just show you this right here.

638
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,000
Uh this is a uh ribosome that we're

639
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,120
looking Whoops. Um so each one of all of

640
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,200
these structures that you see uh in gray

641
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,360
here uh and that are colorcoded

642
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,840
represent molecules that we have been

643
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,240
able to see associated with these

644
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,120
ribosomes um that we can see at

645
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,720
different states of this cycle. Uh so

646
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,840
this these were not any we we were not

647
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,399
interrogating we're not doing template

648
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,559
matching on these structures. they came

649
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,799
out uh because they were electron

650
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,000
densities that were associated with the

651
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,679
ribosome that we had uh uh identified.

652
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,880
Um and this is just showing we can

653
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,360
actually see uh mRNA we can see the mRNA

654
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,440
tunnel. We can actually see um peight

655
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,919
bases uh in this system uh in terms of

656
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,520
the resolution capacity. Okay. Now I

657
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,120
want to just quickly show you a movie

658
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,799
where we're trying to stitch all of

659
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,159
these guys together.

660
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:56,960
um we have 41 different ribosome states

661
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,799
that we can fit in this elongation cycle

662
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,919
pathway. And so what we're going to do

663
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,480
is just um we can align them based on

664
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,320
what we know in terms of the ch the

665
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,120
changes in the confirmation of the

666
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,880
ribosome and we can then play it as a

667
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,520
movie and that's what we're doing right

668
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,200
here. Um so we have um this is the large

669
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,440
subunit. These this is the small subunit

670
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,520
the head and the and the body. Uh these

671
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,120
are associated stuff. Um right here

672
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:30,240
tRNAs uh syntheses that are uh carrying

673
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,159
amino acids into this pocket where a

674
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,480
polyeptide is going to be pulling off

675
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,519
from it. These are other molecules that

676
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,640
are associated uh with the ribosome

677
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,080
during this elongation state. So this

678
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,440
clock right here is just running uh to

679
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,799
show the whole cycle. Um so this is just

680
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
different types of motions that we're

681
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,760
seeing. This is 20s RNA that's basically

682
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,440
showing rigid body motion. It's clearly

683
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,440
it's tightly associated with that large

684
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,840
subunit. We can also see um a uh

685
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,840
interbridge protein that's undergoing a

686
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,399
type of bending motion that's never been

687
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,080
seen before. um but we can pull it out

688
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,080
from these data sets because we can

689
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,279
we're basically aligning all of these

690
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,760
ribosomal states uh in a movie. And then

691
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,039
finally we can look at these tRNAs

692
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,799
syntheses as they come in and move um

693
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,240
across uh these code the the

694
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:28,240
the EPA sites uh for stitching together

695
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,120
uh the polyeptide. So this is just

696
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,640
summarizing um the outlook uh for this

697
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,919
approach as well as other uh

698
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,880
cryotomography approaches. This can be

699
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,600
very much integrated uh together uh with

700
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,399
the system. Um I want to point out that

701
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,679
um I think it's super exciting in terms

702
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,440
of um what what we can do with

703
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,600
structures that are coming out alpha

704
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,960
fold uh other types of structures that

705
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,279
we know um it has the potential to be

706
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,919
used in this type of uh system to be

707
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,799
able to uh more fine-tune the way these

708
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,279
molecules are actually behaving uh

709
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,840
within a cell. So with that, I'm going

710
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,159
to end and thank all the people at

711
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,000
Chanelia who've participated in this. Uh

712
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,039
Peter Rickau, I want to call out again,

713
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,440
is the guy who was um critical for this

714
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,679
high resolution template matching. Um

715
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,320
but uh other people in my lab have been

716
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,720
heavily involved in all of this um

717
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,480
imaging at at these different scales.

718
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,679
Um, none of this would happen uh without

719
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:34,880
incredible support teams from uh crym to

720
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,640
light microscopy uh to computer support

721
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,600
as well as um other uh group leader uh

722
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:45,000
uh uh interactions at Genealia. Thank

723
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,000
you very much.

724
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,760
All right, I think Oh, yes. Okay, we

725
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,279
have time for one question maybe. Well,

726
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,120
I'm going to really use it as a long

727
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,120
question. First of all, this was a a

728
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,679
really fabulous talk and a great way to

729
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,399
open uh this meeting. Very inspiring.

730
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,320
What can be done now? You know, in in an

731
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,399
attempt to show how cool everything is.

732
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,200
I'm being the, you know, forever skeptic

733
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,000
are always like how accurate is this?

734
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,560
Does it know when it go fails? Where

735
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,560
does it fails? And again, to the this

736
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,520
wonderful audience of brilliant trainees

737
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,520
behind me, where do you need them? Okay.

738
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,399
Okay. So, I'll tell you exactly where we

739
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,599
need you. So, you know, you would think

740
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,320
that there's a we have a lot of X-ray

741
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,599
crystalallography structures. Um,

742
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,839
they've been purified, crystallized. Um,

743
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,000
if you take those structures and you try

744
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,480
to find them in our data set, most of

745
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,720
them we cannot find. What does that tell

746
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,480
us? it tells us that structure is not

747
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:55,119
the structure that is the abundant form

748
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:58,400
in this intact cell. Um so the issue is

749
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,520
how do we go about trying to um use the

750
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,839
information from these cryo images and

751
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,000
alpha fold is the same. Alpha fold has

752
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,040
lots of parts of it that you're not

753
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,520
going to see here. The issue is can we

754
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,000
um can we find parts of these structures

755
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,560
that we are pretty confident are going

756
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,119
to be stable are going to be static and

757
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,000
then what we can do is we can actually

758
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,960
just use that as our template forget the

759
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,119
rest of the the protein let's find that

760
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,800
as a template and as I showed just

761
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,720
quickly go I'll just quickly go back

762
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,079
here sorry because this is pretty

763
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,720
significant um this is um we've done

764
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,280
this Here this is the ribosome. Okay,

765
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,480
the large subun of the ribosome. If we

766
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,599
scale it down to only 700 kilodolans, we

767
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,680
basically shaved off um a huge part of

768
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,680
this ribosome and we're going to search

769
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,680
for it within our sample. We can find it

770
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,760
through its we find it and then we look

771
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,359
at the reconstructed density. We get the

772
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,359
ribosome. Uh and we can do this down to

773
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,560
uh this is this right here is where

774
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,800
we've got a um a 700 KD target where

775
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,119
we're successfully doing that. Uh in

776
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,599
comparison cryotomography and spa

777
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,560
approaches you don't get anywhere near

778
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,000
um that in terms of identifying um the

779
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,800
structure within an intact cell. So this

780
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,599
we really need help from people who can

781
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,400
sort of help us. Um well first the

782
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,160
compute time is huge. Um we need we need

783
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,800
to figure out ways to very make this

784
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,839
refined to do the searching uh took us

785
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,480
two months to search um pulling out

786
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,040
those ribosomes in just one simple case.

787
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,800
Um so having better you know

788
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,920
computational sort of uh uh pairing etc

789
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,839
could speed this up. Uh but also um you

790
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,359
know being able to understand what these

791
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,480
structure how to deal with these

792
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,520
structures I think would be really

793
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,079
important. Great

794
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,520
question.

795
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
Okay, great. Thank you. So,

796
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,720
unfortunately, we will just do the one

797
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,480
question and I'll pass it over to

798
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,480
Sebastiano to introduce our next

799
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,480
speaker.

800
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,320
[Applause]
