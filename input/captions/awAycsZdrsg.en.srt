1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,000
So with MITHIC, we have four
different funds to support

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,680
research of different types.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
And what research means
means different things

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,720
for different faculty.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,480
So for our next
presentation is actually

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
a partial screening of a film.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,680
So this is a film by Vivek
Bald from comparative media

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,718
studies and writing.

10
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,760
And he's going to come
give a little introduction

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,260
to the movie.

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,885
And then, we'll watch
about 15 minutes.

13
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,220
So, Vivek, are you here?

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,820
Yes, you are.

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,340
Here you go.

16
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,812
[APPLAUSE]

17
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:38,280

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,140
Thank you.

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,180
Thank you so much.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,920
I feel honored to be here to
present some of this work.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,080
Before I start, of
course, I'd like

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,040
to express my sincere gratitude
to Provost Chandrakasan, Dean

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,940
Rayo, Associate Dean
Makan for their vision

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,660
and leadership in bringing
the MITHIC initiative to life,

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,740
To Jen Dalton and Elena Nosiglia
for organizing today's event,

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,700
and to President Kornbluth for
her commitment to humanities,

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,220
arts, and social
sciences at a moment

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,260
in which critical thinking,
creativity, and social analysis

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:29,060
are both more endangered
and more needed than ever.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,340
As some of you know, I am
a historian and documentary

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,740
filmmaker.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,780
And my work combines
scholarship and media production

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,820
to illuminate the past
and present stories

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,700
of people of
Indian, Bangladeshi,

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,220
and Pakistani descent
in the US and Britain.

36
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,220
I focus particularly
on the lives

37
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,980
that South Asians have
built with and alongside

38
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,760
other immigrant communities
and communities of color.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,520
For the past several years, I've
been documenting a previously

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,160
unknown history of
South Asian Muslim men,

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,120
men from colonized
British India,

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,880
who came to New York in
the 1920s, '30s, and '40s.

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,560
This was at the height of what
is known as the Asian Exclusion

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,920
Era, a period stretching
for more than 80 years, when

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,240
the United States passed a
series of race-based immigration

46
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,760
laws that barred the entry of
the vast majority of people

47
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,640
from Asia.

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,040
These men, undocumented
and unwelcomed

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,800
by the larger US nation,
found refuge and respite

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
in Black and Puerto
Rican communities

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,400
on the Lower East
Side and in Harlem.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,480
They found jobs, married, and
started families with women

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,320
from their adopted
neighborhoods and crafted

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,180
new multiracial lives.

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,380
Together, these South Asian
Muslim immigrants, their Black

56
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,540
and Puerto Rican partners,
their children and grandchildren

57
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,460
have been an unacknowledged
part of the fabric of New York

58
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,260
City for over 100
years and forging

59
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,100
a kind of long
prehistory, now I can

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,020
say, to the first South
Asian Muslim immigrant mayor

61
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,220
of New York.

62
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,660
As someone who worked in
documentary film for more

63
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,740
than a decade before
pursuing a PhD,

64
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,820
I'm still driven by
the goal of making

65
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,100
my scholarship
accessible and meaningful

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,980
to broader publics
outside the Academy

67
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,260
and especially to the
communities whose histories I

68
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,020
document.

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,520
I'm just going to put that over.

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,780

71
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,860
It is for this reason
that I continue

72
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,480
to work across multiple
media forums norms,

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,120
producing written scholarship,
film, and digital oral histories

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,880
for the web.

75
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,360
It is also for this reason that
I treat each of my documentaries

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,960
not as an endpoint, as a
finished product to be marketed,

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,320
but rather as a starting
point, an opportunity

78
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,279
to bring people together in
the collective act of viewing

79
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,680
to cultivate discussion and
dialogue about shared histories

80
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,760
and experiences and
to forge understanding

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,840
and new connections across
our supposed differences.

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,800
This public-facing
work is a key aspect

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,840
of my work as a
scholar, entwined

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,080
with my more traditional
writing and research.

85
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,000
So I was understandably
excited to hear

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,200
about the initial round
of MITHIC funding,

87
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,740
not just as a new
stream of funding

88
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,340
within the institute,
but as an initiative that

89
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,060
values and supports
bridge-building internally

90
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,740
across disciplines as well as
externally between the academy

91
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,380
and the public.

92
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,740
As part of the first cohort of
recipients of the Humanities

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,380
Cultivation Fund, I partnered
with South Asian and other

94
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,020
community-based organizations
locally in the Boston area,

95
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,540
as well as internationally
in the United Kingdom,

96
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,620
on a series of public
screenings and discussions

97
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,100
of my documentary In
Search of Bengali Harlem,

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,340
focusing on three of
the film's key themes--

99
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,540
xenophobia and
anti-immigrant violence;

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,820
Black South Asian
intimacies, solidarities,

101
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,060
and community-making; and
intergenerational trauma

102
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,900
and healing within
immigrant families.

103
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,740
In London and Birmingham--
and I'll show you a few

104
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,480
of the slides here
from those events--

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,000
in London and Birmingham,
I collaborated

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,040
with four organizations.

107
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,640
Rich Mix, a community
arts organization

108
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,840
grounded in the
historically Bangladeshi

109
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,960
immigrant neighborhood of
Tower Hamlets in East London.

110
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,200
Brown girl in the
Ring, which showcases

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,240
spoken-word literature,
music, and dance

112
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,760
by British South Asian women.

113
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,400
Soul City Arts, an arts
organization and performance

114
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,520
space in the heart of Britain's
second largest Bangladeshi

115
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,840
neighborhood in Birmingham.

116
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,600
And the BlindianProject, an
online community of more than

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,290
30,000 black and South Asian
families in the US and UK.

118
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,920

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,680
These are just a few
slides from these events,

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,500
which I've just returned from.

121
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,260

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:05,020
The Boston-based event was
at Bartos Theater in October

123
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,300
and was a collaboration
with the Cambridge-

124
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,580
and Boston-based South Asian
arts organization Subcontinental

125
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,940
Drift, who some of you might be
familiar with from the Diwali

126
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,450
celebration that
they do at the MFA.

127
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,780

128
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,500
Along with MIT student groups,
the Asian-American initiative,

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,020
South Asian Association
of Students,

130
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,980
and the Bangladeshi Student
Organization, both at MIT

131
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,060
and the BSA of Wellesley
as well, and featured

132
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,700
its discussants, two
of my former students,

133
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,920
the president of MIT BSA, and
a Bangladeshi American student

134
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,600
from Cambridge's high school,
CRLS, where my own daughter just

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
started.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,100
So this was a really
rich discussion.

137
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,340
Also, we brought up my
editor, Beyza Boyacioglu,

138
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,840
who is an alum of the
CMS master's program

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
and has become a very
sought-after editor in New York

140
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
City.

141
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,480
So In Search of Bengali
Harlem itself, the film,

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,800
is 84 minutes
long, so I can only

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,960
show two short segments
totaling about 10 minutes.

144
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,720
But I hope it will give you
a sense of the film as a film

145
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,039
but also as a catalyst for
the kind of collective work

146
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,000
that I've described.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,280
All right, let's roll.

148
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,480
Thank you.

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,940
[APPLAUSE]

150
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,440

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

152
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,320
- --part of some larger history
that hadn't been recorded yet.

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,400
I started the process
looking at the indexes.

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,240
- These look like ATRAX.

155
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,060
- Yeah.

156
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,380
- [CHUCKLES]

157
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,465
- Grooms index, all
boroughs, 1928 to 1932.

158
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:05,310
- Right.

159
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,720
- So I started looking
through these for those names.

160
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,660
Ali, [INAUDIBLE],
[INAUDIBLE], Mia,

161
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,780
surnames that were common
among Bengali Muslims.

162
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,520
So over in these cabinets are
microfilms of the actual--

163
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,580
- Marriage certificates?

164
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,110
- Marriage certificates.

165
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,700
- OK.

166
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,240
- Yes.

167
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,510
- 29364, Muhammad Abdul is
married to Sadie Simmons.

168
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,706
- Yeah.

169
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:33,020
- Wow, 1923.

170
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,880
Can you imagine what
their wedding was like?

171
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,460

172
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,600
Most of them says India.

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,720
Right, because, back then,
It wasn't Bangladesh.

174
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,940
It was India.

175
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,640
- When they came here,
first they were Indian,

176
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,100
then they were
Pakistani, then they

177
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,765
were Bangladeshi because of
the independence movements

- So in a lifetime, my
father had three identities.

- All right, so here we go.

reference to history

185
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,710
is the history of the New York--

But I feel their one degree of
separation away from my dad.

191
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,990
- So let's take a look
at the one from 1939.

192

This, can you read that?

197
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,740
- Ali Habib, Maria
V. Echavarria.

198
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,770
- That's your father.

199
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,290
And this is Victoria.

200
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,930
So he went by Habib Ali.

201
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,500
- Ali, right.

202
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,000
- Right?

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,140
Color or race, it
says Indian white.

204
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,396
- What's Indian white?

205
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:01,330
- Sometimes they're referred
to as white, sometimes colored,

206
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,310
sometimes black.

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,680
- Cook, age 28.

209
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,010
- Age 28.

210
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,750
- Wow.

211
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,150
- So this was a pattern that
there were a lot more men

212
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,350
than just your father and
his small circle of friends.

213
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,630
They were almost all marrying
either African-American

214
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,970
or Puerto Rican women.

215
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,830
They were almost all working in
these service-type jobs, which

216
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,590
were all also occupations that
other men of color in that era

217
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,690
would have been doing.

218
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,830
And we know that they were
settling in the Lower East Side

219
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,890
and in Harlem.

220
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,610
- I didn't realize
there was that many.

221
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,950
- So then the next thing
that I started looking at

222
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,570
was ship's passenger records.

223
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,270
I didn't find any
passengers with these names,

224
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,230
but I found lots and lots
and lots of ship workers.

listed as firemen.

229
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:11,770
And those were the
people who shoveled coal

230
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,090
into the furnaces,
the stokers who

231
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,290
also kept the fire at a
particular temperature, cooks

So, then, it started
to make sense.

234
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,050
So they were actually men
who had come as ship workers

235
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,430
and jumped ship.

something on board their ship.

them up on meat hooks

I felt a freedom.

358
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,670
He opened the
restaurant in 1958.

359
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,860
And shortly after
that, he got married.

360
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:46,330

361
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,650
He lived to get
up and go to work.

362
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,130
He loved it.

363
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,170
That was him in the kitchen.

364
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,990
There was a counter in
the front, very American.

365
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,750
There was four of us--
my brother, my mother.

366
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,070
We worked-- chop
up, peel carrots.

367
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,010
I'd stand on the soda crate
and watch him butcher the lamb,

368
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,270
or the beef, or the
chicken and cut it up.

369
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,310
And I had chicken curry just
about every day of my life,

370
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,970
as far as I can recall.

371
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,050
She would cook on Friday nights.

372
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,777
We'd have our Southern
food on Friday nights

373
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:18,610
up in the apartment.

374
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,550
- But he liked it.

375
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,070
He liked it.

376
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,770
- We had our birthday
parties there.

377
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,750
Miles Davis used to come in.

378
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,430
I used to serve
him all the time.

379
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,670
I remember Cicely
Tyson sitting there.

380
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,300
- Morgan Freeman came.

381
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,180
- Mark Breland, a boxer;
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

My father passed away in 1982.

385
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,190
She ran it for another
15 years without him.

This little black woman
from Pawleys Island,

South Carolina, you know what?

388
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,570
That's why she went after him.

389
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,230
Because she had to carry
on the legacy of running

390
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,370
this Indian restaurant
17 years after he died.

391
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,520
- Wow, he's no joke.

Oh, well, I was going to
say we should applaud Vivek,

398
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,310
but I can't find him.

399

Oh, there he is.

Thanks so much.

And as you can imagine, as a
multiracial child of a South

Asian immigrant, this
resonates strongly for me.
