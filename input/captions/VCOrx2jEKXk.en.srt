1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,599
Okay. So remember that projection theory

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,039
works differently over uh if you look in

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
finite fields it works differently over

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,039
a prime field or a notp prime field. And

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,039
here was the key example.

6
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,559
Um, so we're going to do projection

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,399
theory in FQ and Q is P ^2 and our set

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,920
of points is going to be FP^2 which is a

9
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,039
subset of FQ ^2 and our set of

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,120
directions is going to be FP which is a

11
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:57,120
subset of FQ. So remember that uh if

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,960
theta is in fq then pi theta is going to

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,719
be a projection a linear map from fq ^2

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,680
to fq

15
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,799
which is given by pi theta of x1 x2 is

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,680
x1 + theta x2.

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,360
So this is our set of directions

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,000
and then s which is the maximum size of

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,000
the projection of x over all these

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,479
directions

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,360
um is uh is is p um because pi theta of

22
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,240
x is just fp

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,240
uh for theta and d.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Okay. So if you uh just write down the

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,479
sizes of all the things in this

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,399
important example, x is p ^2 which is q

27
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,600
and s and d are p which is q to the

28
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,520
half. So in in particular notice that

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,960
the size of each projection is the

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,960
square root of the size of the set.

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,960
Okay. Um so

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,479
so nothing like this is supposed to

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,280
happen over FP and there's a hard open

34
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
conjecture that um that gives bounds

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,360
that are much stronger than this

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,080
example. Um but the techniques that

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
we've talked about for most of the class

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
do not depend on the field. So the

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
double counting does not distinguish

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,680
prime fields from not prime fields and

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,520
the 4A method does not distinguish prime

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,599
fields from not prime fields.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,040
Um the summer ready trotder theorem

44
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,120
proves that this numerology cannot

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,800
happen for a set of points in R2. Um but

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
the proof has the proof is very

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,560
important but it has some limitations in

48
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,680
how it could apply. It certainly won't

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,760
apply over FP. Um and it also doesn't

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,120
seem to help very much from the point of

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,879
view of uh sets of balls in R2 with some

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
kind of spacing condition. It depends

53
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,840
what spacing condition but for the most

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
interesting spacing condition it doesn't

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,120
help very much.

56
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,879
Okay. Nevertheless, we know that this

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,879
cannot happen over finite fields

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,400
and the main theorem that we'll so this

59
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,879
week we will prove a theorem that says

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,480
that this cannot happen. So this is the

61
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,480
theorem of Ban Kats and Tao.

62
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,840
So again cat's tow projection theorem.

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay it says the following thing. So if

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,120
we have x in fp^2

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,519
and let's say that the size of x is p to

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,560
the s where s is uh somewhere between

67
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,640
zero and two.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,319
Okay. And then we have a set of

69
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,159
directions

70
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,120
in FP

71
00:03:52,159 --> 00:04:01,720
and the set of directions will be p to

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,720
the t and t is uh bigger than zero.

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Okay. So then if you look at the maximum

74
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,840
size of a projection,

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,200
[Applause]

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,519
it's significantly bigger than half of

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,440
the the square root of the of the size

78
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:26,120
of of X. So this is bigger than P to the

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,120
S over 2 plus epsilon

80
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,560
where this epsilon only depends on S and

81
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,280
T.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,280
It's bigger than zero.

83
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,919
Okay. Um, so some remarks about the

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
epsilon. It's it's an explicit function.

85
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,960
I just don't write it down because it's

86
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
a little bit messy. For example, it's

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,759
continuous. It's not that hard to write

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,040
it down, but it is also pretty small.

89
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,320
Pretty disappointingly small.

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,919
Okay.

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
Um

92
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,360
there's also something called Bans's

93
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
projection theorem which is what publish

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,080
MKin is going to talk about today which

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,440
is the analog of this over the in the

96
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,919
setting of the real of balls in R2.

97
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,320
Um so there's an analog of this example

98
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,000
using C2 instead of R2 and then BN's

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,000
projection theorem is the analog of this

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
theorem that rules out that example.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So

102
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,560
this is an analogous theorem

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,000
for balls and art.

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,600
Okay. And these two theorems in spite of

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,800
the fact that this epsilon is very small

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
are very important sort of landmark

107
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,680
results in the field of projection

108
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,440
theory and they play a key role in many

109
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,440
applications. Um uh this ban projection

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,800
theorem it plays a key role in getting

111
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,280
the sharp projection estimates in R2 the

112
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,400
recent work uh that publish mkin and

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,919
others were involved in. Um this banan

114
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,840
projection theorem also plays an

115
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,520
important role in the solution of the ka

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,919
problem.

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
Um and this finite field projection

118
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,759
theorem as well as this one have some

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,319
have a important role in some

120
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,039
interesting applications about um how

121
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,280
fast different processes mix. Like if

122
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,479
you take some generators of a finite

123
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,440
group like SL2 over FP

124
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,600
um and then they make a random walk. How

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
fast does this random walk become evenly

126
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
distributed in SL2FP?

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,479
This is an important ingredient in

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,319
studying that.

129
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,759
Okay. Um so okay. So in spite of the

130
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,360
fact that the epsilon is small, these

131
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,800
theorems are are very important and

132
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
they're also qualitatively different

133
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,479
from the other theorems because they're

134
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,759
sensitive to what kind of field we're

135
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,880
working. Yeah.

136
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,520
>> What is the analog of P for ball or R2?

137
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,039
>> The analog of P. So we would have uh the

138
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,840
setting would be you'd have unit balls

139
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,479
and a ball of radius r and r is the

140
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,479
analog of p.

141
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,440
So all the sizes of things we would we

142
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
could think of them as powers of r.

143
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Yeah.

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,759
>> Do the proofs use kind of similar

145
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,680
arguments or they completely

146
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
>> the question is do these two proofs use

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
similar arguments or are they completely

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,000
different? Um there are multiple proofs

149
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,560
of this um but at least one of them is

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,599
very similar to this with one sort of

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,479
layer of additional ideas

152
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,160
and so yeah so my plan is that we'll

153
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,520
we'll do this and then we'll talk about

154
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,520
the additional ideas to do this.

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay cool. Well so the key difference

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,000
between FQ and FP is that FQ has a sub

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,759
field and FP has no sub field. Now, it's

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
elementary to check that FP has no

159
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,240
subfield, but because we're proving some

160
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,440
kind of quantitative estimates, we need

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,919
some quantitative lema that that says

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
that FP not only has no subfield, but it

163
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,479
doesn't have anything that's kind of

164
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,479
approximately a sub field. Um, so the

165
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:24,479
main goal for today will be to uh to to

166
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:27,199
prove to develop uh lambas like that.

167
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,879
And let me show you. So, so here's the

168
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,879
first version of a lema like that.

169
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,719
level one. Actually, let me do I think

170
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,719
we need a little notation.

171
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,399
Okay, so suppose that A is a subset of

172
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,880
FP.

173
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:54,240
If I write a + a, then that means the

174
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:59,040
set of all the sums a1 plus a2 where a1

175
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,360
and a2 are a and we could write a * a.

176
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,399
That's the set of all the products a1 *

177
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,160
a2 a1 and a2 and a

178
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,880
and so on. So there you can write a lot

179
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,800
of similar things like this and um I

180
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
think it'll be clear what they all mean

181
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,279
but if it's not of course we we'll talk

182
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,000
about it. Okay, so here's the lema. It's

183
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,080
a quantitative lema that says that um

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,560
that no subset behaves too much like a

185
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,120
sub field.

186
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,680
So it says if A is a subset of FP

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,680
then either

188
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:44,279
one option is that A minus A over A

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,279
minus A is all the death P

190
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,540
and the second option

191
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,160
is that

192
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:57,120
[Applause]

193
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,760
if you multiply try and add stuff in a

194
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,200
and subtract stuff. A lot of times it

195
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
will get bigger. 1 2 3 4 5 six. Six

196
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,090
might be enough. I think it might be

197
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,289
eight.

198
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,289
[Applause]

199
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
Okay. So, one possibility is if you

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,760
multiply, add and subtract elements of A

201
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,240
lot of times, then you get a lot more

202
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,880
stuff than just a. So this says A is not

203
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,640
too close to a sub field. And the other

204
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
options is if you do this you get all of

205
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
FP.

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
Now of course A could have been almost

207
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,959
all of FP already. So then it is kind of

208
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,240
almost a field. But if A was originally

209
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,600
a lot smaller than FP then in this case

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,600
this thing is a lot bigger than A.

211
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,959
Okay.

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,959
Um,

213
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,959
cool.

214
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,279
All right.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,240
[Applause]

216
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,000
So, here is the proof.

217
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,000
Um, observation one.

218
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,880
So if uh c is not in a minus a over a

219
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,000
minus a

220
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,279
um then

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,079
a + c a

222
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,079
has size a squ.

223
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,279
Okay. Let me make sure it's clear what

224
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,760
all the notation means. So if I write

225
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,480
this thing, I have four copies of A. So

226
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,640
you take A1, A2, A3, A4, any four guys

227
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040
in A and sort of plug them in for the

228
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,079
capital A. All the things you can get.

229
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,480
That's what this set is. And similarly

230
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,360
over here the lowerase C is a particular

231
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,360
element of FP and this means take any A1

232
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:12,240
and A2 and and do this.

233
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Okay. Um so the proof of observation one

234
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:20,079
is quite simple. So suppose that I have

235
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,600
two different uh ele uh elements in here

236
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,600
but that are equal to each other. So

237
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:29,839
suppose a1 + c a2 is the same as a1

238
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,600
prime plus c a2 prime.

239
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, if I do a little algebra, I can

240
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:40,320
solve this for C. And I discover that C

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:48,079
is um A1 prime minus A1

242
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:50,320
/ A2 - A2 prime, which is in A minus A.

243
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,800
So if C is not in A minus A, sorry,

244
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:58,160
which is in A minus A over A minus A.

245
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,600
So if C is not in here, then all of

246
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,360
these different representations are

247
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,320
actually different numbers. So the size

248
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,320
of this set is A^ squ.

249
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,880
Okay. Now if you want to be really

250
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
careful, maybe we should worry about

251
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,079
whether I have divided by zero. But if

252
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,079
a2 is equal to a2 prime, then the only

253
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
way that the top equation could be true

254
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,800
is if also a1 is equal to a1 prime and

255
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,240
then I just had the same thing. Okay.

256
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,880
All right. Great.

257
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,079
Okay. So,

258
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,000
so if I can locate some C that is in um

259
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,720
you know the ring of stuff I can make by

260
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,399
adding and multip maybe the if I can add

261
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,120
and subtract and multiply and divide a

262
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,639
bunch of elements of A and I can locate

263
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,000
some C which is not in here then I can

264
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,320
use this observation and I can get some

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,839
I can show that I can build out of A

266
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,279
many different things.

267
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,920
Okay, cool.

268
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,760
Okay,

269
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,440
now somewhere in our proof, we have to

270
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,120
use that FP is a prime field.

271
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,199
It wouldn't work in FQ and we haven't

272
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,279
used it yet. Well, how are we going to

273
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,320
use it? Well, let's just remember how we

274
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,199
would prove that FP is a prime field.

275
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,199
Um, sorry, how would we prove that FP

276
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,720
has no sub fields? How are we going to

277
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,600
prove? Well, um, if it had a sub field,

278
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,279
it would have to contain one

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,480
and then it would have to contain then

280
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,600
it would be closed under addition. So,

281
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
it would have to contain two and three

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,839
and four and so on and then it would

283
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,040
have to contain all of FP.

284
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,120
Okay. Um,

285
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,639
so we we're basically going to use that

286
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,639
argument in observation two.

287
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,469
[Applause]

288
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay. So observation two if a minus a

289
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:31,279
over a minus a is not everything

290
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,560
um then there exists some b in a minus a

291
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:39,760
over a minus a

292
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:42,160
so that b + 1 is not in a minus a over a

293
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,160
minus

294
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Right.

295
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,240
Right. Okay. So why is it um so so zero

296
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,680
is an a minus a over a minus a. It's a

297
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
proof of observation too.

298
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,880
zero is in there because you could

299
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,560
choose these to be the same and you can

300
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:25,279
choose those to be different.

301
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:28,399
Um okay if one is not

302
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,959
uh yeah okay so then then we just if

303
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,199
okay either everybody in FP is in A

304
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:38,320
minus A minus A minus A or somebody's

305
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,639
not and so then we take uh B + one is

306
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,000
the smallest

307
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,440
number which is not

308
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,079
an A minus A over A minus A

309
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,079
and there we go.

310
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,120
Okay. And the special thing that we're

311
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,680
using about FP we've used that we have

312
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,120
it's a prime field is just we're using

313
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,519
that if you start at zero and you keep

314
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,199
adding one you get all the elements.

315
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,880
Okay. So that's the proof of observation

316
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,480
too.

317
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,919
Um

318
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,439
and so now we are basically done. So now

319
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,039
we have seen that if a minus a over a

320
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:23,600
minus a is not fp

321
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:27,520
then if you take a and you add this b +

322
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:31,039
one. So b is an a minus a over a minus

323
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,160
a. I'm going to add one to it. So b +

324
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:37,160
one is in here. There is bigger than a

325
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
square.

326
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,360
So if I take six elements of a and I do

327
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,880
this uh the number of different guys I

328
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,880
will get is is really much bigger than

329
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,080
okay and then this doesn't look exactly

330
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,440
like my two but I just like clear the

331
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,440
denominator and expand things out.

332
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,919
So when I clear the denominator, I'll

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
get

334
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,280
a * a minus a * a from this guy. Inside

335
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,320
of here, I'll have a minus a plus a

336
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,799
minus a all multiplied by a. Okay, I

337
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,799
have a bunch of stuff.

338
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,720
Okay.

339
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,240
So, I know so Nets Katz and I are old

340
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,720
collaborators and I remember talking

341
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,400
with him about this and and uh that

342
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,919
it it took quite a while for them to

343
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,440
figure out how to get started on this

344
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,200
problem.

345
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,679
Um okay, now looking back at this this

346
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,120
this proof is really clean. this lema is

347
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
perhaps not the the statement of the

348
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,530
lema is perhaps not the nicest thing

349
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:09,059
that you might like. Um and um

350
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,059
[Applause]

351
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,799
so there are much there are kind of

352
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,360
cleaner things like for example later

353
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,880
today we'll show that you know just just

354
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,440
this is significantly bigger than a

355
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:28,440
um and and different variations.

356
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Okay.

357
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Um,

358
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,720
so maybe we should mention we could ask

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,600
some much simpler questions like we

360
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,039
could just say um if you have a subset

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:51,200
of FP called A, is it true that A plus A

362
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,679
is always much bigger than A?

363
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,160
That's true for most subsets, but it's

364
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,679
not true for all of them. Um, but

365
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,320
thinking about that much simpler

366
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,240
question is actually uh so that that's

367
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,160
like a a foundational question in in

368
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,960
additive combinatorics to understand

369
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,039
that um and and understanding that well

370
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,919
feeds into being able to understand this

371
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,280
this stuff better. Okay. So, let me pose

372
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,600
this on the board and we'll start to

373
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,600
talk about it.

374
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,280
So my question for us is

375
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,720
um when

376
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,720
is a + a

377
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,720
small?

378
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
So here I have in mind that A is a

379
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,760
subset of FP. Although we could have a

380
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,120
very similar conversation if A was a

381
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,520
subset of Z or A was a subset of R or

382
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,520
dot dot dot.

383
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,080
Okay. Can anybody think of a subset if

384
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,240
FP or A plus A is only a tiny bit bigger

385
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,240
than A?

386
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,640
Yeah,

387
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,960
>> is some set

388
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,960
um

389
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,360
and that includes like numbers and then

390
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,720
the negative values of those numbers in

391
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,640
F like only one 2 -2 or something like

392
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,120
that.

393
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,480
>> Yeah. Yeah. So the comment is maybe I

394
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,159
should have some numbers and negative of

395
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,159
those numbers. Let me ask you a more

396
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,039
precise question. So you have to choose

397
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,039
L numbers in FP and you want to choose

398
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,799
them to make A plus A as small as

399
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,799
possible. Who would you choose?

400
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,760
>> Yeah.

401
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,280
[Music]

402
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,799
>> Yeah, you could choose an arithmetic

403
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,760
progression.

404
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,720
So example one.

405
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,039
Um suppose A was just the numbers from

406
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,919
one up to L.

407
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:08,480
So a plus a will be the numbers from 2

408
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:10,960
to 2 l. Uh so a + a is at most 2 * a.

409
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,600
It's tiniest bit less than that but not

410
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,280
very important for our discussion. And

411
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
this is the small this is the the

412
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,039
smallest that a plus a could possibly

413
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,679
be.

414
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,520
Okay. And it doesn't have to be one up

415
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,000
to l. It would work just as well if it

416
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,039
was an arithmetic progression. So

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,960
example one prime

418
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:38,919
our set A is little a + n d where n goes

419
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,919
from one up to l.

420
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
Um and then if you think about it a

421
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,360
little bit the size of the subset

422
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,360
behaves just the same.

423
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,679
Okay.

424
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,080
Um

425
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,480
there's another example that's a little

426
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,080
bit more general than this. So this is

427
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,039
an arithmetic progression where you have

428
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,679
just one kind of difference.

429
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,840
Um

430
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,159
and you could have something uh

431
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,039
uh so you should you could visualize it

432
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,120
like this.

433
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,720
And you could have a similar thing

434
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,200
involving a two-dimensional grid or a

435
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,280
higher dimensional grid.

436
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:37,320
All right. So example two is that a is a

437
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,320
+ n1 d1 plus dot dot dot plus n r

438
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:46,039
where um n i goes from one up to l i.

439
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,559
So what happens when you take a plus a?

440
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:00,240
It is contained in two little a plus n1

441
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:03,760
d1 plus dot dot dot plus nr

442
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,080
where now the n i go in between two and

443
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,080
2 li.

444
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,159
And so we see from this and I well which

445
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,200
so it which is contained in I could put

446
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:23,360
a one um so it's contained in something

447
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:29,640
that is 2 to the r * bigger. So we get a

448
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,640
+ a is bounded by 2 to the r * a.

449
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,400
So this thing here is called a

450
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,400
generalized arithmetic progression. It

451
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:41,919
has a dimension little r and it has a

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,640
volume or cardality which is

453
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,640
L1 to LR.

454
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,799
Okay. Um

455
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,799
can anybody think of any others?

456
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
So it is hard to think of other ones and

457
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,159
in some sense and and depending on how

458
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,000
we quantify it a little bit um these

459
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,240
sets or maybe these sets and their close

460
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,640
cousins appear to be the only sets that

461
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,679
have a really small subset

462
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,960
and um this was investigated by framan

463
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,640
starting in the 60s and 70s and he

464
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,600
proved a theorem to that effect called

465
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,919
framan's theorem Um

466
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,200
and um

467
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,000
uh and this was this is a a cornerstone

468
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,000
of additive combinatorics.

469
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,600
Um Framan's

470
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,600
Framan's proof was was somewhat

471
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,080
difficult to read and Rusa thought a lot

472
00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:00,440
about it and clarified it and so this is

473
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,440
now called uh the Framan Rousa theory.

474
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,200
Okay. So it says the following thing.

475
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,200
Says that if a

476
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
um

477
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,320
so if a is in z the same thing would be

478
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,880
true in z mod p and a + a is less than

479
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,600
or equal to k a.

480
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,440
Um then

481
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,919
a is contained in a gap

482
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,840
with dimension

483
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:42,960
uh little r that only depends on k and

484
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:47,640
volume at most uh v that only depends on

485
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,640
k times the size of a.

486
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,400
So it roughly says that if a plus a is

487
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,480
small it is because a resembles example

488
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,159
two which is a generalization of example

489
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,640
one.

490
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,640
So in some sense these are the only sets

491
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,279
that have a really small subset.

492
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,200
Okay. So this is an important theorem in

493
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,080
additive combinotaurics but there are

494
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,320
two caveats about it. So one caveat is

495
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,200
that it's a it's a pretty deep theorem.

496
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,440
The proof is substantial

497
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,960
and the other caveat is that the

498
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,960
quantitative bounds are weak.

499
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,200
Um so in the original version

500
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,840
r of k was quite large. So r of k was

501
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:44,080
something like x of k to a power and v

502
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:47,960
of k was even larger. It's like x of x

503
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,960
of k to a power.

504
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:58,799
Okay. Um now

505
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,640
it is a trivial fact that any set A is

506
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,799
contained in a generalized arithmetic

507
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,039
progression of dimension equal to the

508
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,080
size of A.

509
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,640
So this is only interesting if R of K is

510
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,120
smaller than the size of A.

511
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:19,240
Um so this was only interesting

512
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,240
only meaningful let's say

513
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,880
if k was quite small.

514
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,760
Uh there's a big in um goal in additive

515
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,640
combinatorics to improve the

516
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,120
quantitative bounds in framan's theorem

517
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,080
and um

518
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,399
one benchmark is a conjecture called the

519
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,799
polomial frame and roua conjecture which

520
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,720
would say something meaningful even if k

521
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,039
was a small power of a. So there's a

522
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,000
conjecture that they would have a

523
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,000
meaningful bound

524
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:05,080
if k is a to the delta

525
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,080
for some small but universal

526
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,039
delta bigger than zero.

527
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,200
Okay. And this is still an open

528
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,919
conjecture. So it's out of range maybe

529
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,000
only a little out of range of of uh

530
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,480
current techniques. Um but if k was say

531
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,720
I don't know a to the 0.1

532
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,200
all this stuff about about framan's

533
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,480
theorem uh we we are very far from being

534
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,559
able to to deal with that.

535
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,880
Um

536
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,080
now if you look at framan's theorem what

537
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,200
we're trying to do is to give a complete

538
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,720
classification of all the sets A that do

539
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
this

540
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,799
and the complete classification is

541
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,120
something we only understand if K is

542
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,559
really really small.

543
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,559
But you could also ask for something

544
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,120
which is not as strong as a complete

545
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,120
classification but just some kind of

546
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,000
interesting information about sets A

547
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,559
with small subset.

548
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,120
Um okay

549
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,320
so if you look at this example you'll

550
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,039
notice that not only it has small subset

551
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,679
but it has uh also small a bunch of

552
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,720
other stuff like in these examples a

553
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,880
plus a is small also a minus a is small

554
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:25,840
also a plus a plus a is small

555
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,840
um and and and those so those for those

556
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,480
things we have much simpler proofs and

557
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,200
the quantitative bound s are much better

558
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,679
and they come from some lemmas that I

559
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,000
think originally were designed as uh

560
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,960
lemmas for this theorem but which have

561
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,960
lots of independent applications.

562
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Okay.

563
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,120
So this theorem we I don't plan to prove

564
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,360
in the class but I wanted to mention it

565
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,000
for historical context and and these

566
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,960
lemmas are are really important and have

567
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,120
reasonable short proofs and I think are

568
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,240
worth for a wide range of people uh

569
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:09,329
knowing about.

570
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,329
[Applause]

571
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Okay,

572
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,799
so the first of the lemas is called the

573
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,799
rusa triangle inequality.

574
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,360
Okay, so it says if Z is an Aelian group

575
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,360
and A and B and C are subsets of Z,

576
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:48,000
then

577
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:51,200
size of A times the size of B minus C is

578
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,320
bounded by the size of A minus B times

579
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,320
the size of A minus C.

580
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,159
Okay, so this might uh take a little

581
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,399
digesting. Have all of these letters

582
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,799
feels a little bit like alphabet soup.

583
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,880
Um the fact that we have can put three

584
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,640
different sets

585
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,159
makes it a little harder to digest but

586
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,320
it you know of course it makes it more

587
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,240
flexible in general and by plugging in

588
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,559
different choices for these three sets

589
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,840
you can prove some simpler things. Let

590
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,840
me illustrate this with an example.

591
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,440
As a correlator of this we will see

592
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,720
that if the if the sum set is small then

593
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,720
the difference set is also small.

594
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,519
Okay.

595
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,519
So correlary

596
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,640
if a + a is smaller than k * a

597
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,600
then

598
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,480
a minus a is smaller than k^ 2

599
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,720
k^ 2 * a.

600
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,399
So this lema is meaningful as long as k

601
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,240
is slightly smaller than the square root

602
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,880
of a.

603
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,480
So in a in a much wider range than than

604
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,640
the um uh frame and rusa theorem this is

605
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,480
a meaningful statement.

606
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,559
Okay. So proof um we're just going to

607
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,120
use roua and I have to tell you who are

608
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,720
a and b and c. So A will be A and then I

609
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,720
think

610
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,720
B

611
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,799
uh

612
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:50,799
yeah B and C are both negative A.

613
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,640
Okay. So if you look at B minus C that's

614
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,279
there's a lot of minus signs. This is a

615
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,279
little bit silly looking.

616
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,360
Um,

617
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:10,240
so that's just a minus a.

618
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,839
Okay. And a minus b or a minus c.

619
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,079
They're the same as each other because b

620
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:19,639
is the same as c. That's a minus a. So

621
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,639
that's a plus.

622
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:28,399
Okay. So now if we just plug in ra it

623
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:34,000
says a * this guy a minus a is less than

624
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:37,040
this guy times this guy that's a + a 2.

625
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,399
And by hypothesis that's smaller than k

626
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,800
2 a 2.

627
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,800
And if you cancel the factor of a that's

628
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,800
it.

629
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,480
Okay. And this has a a very simple proof

630
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,240
that will fit on this board and which is

631
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,680
already says something interesting and

632
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,320
non-trivial about how sums and

633
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:15,599
differences and stuff fit together. So

634
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:19,359
here's the proof. uh we will construct

635
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,880
a map fee that goes from a cross b minus

636
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,680
c

637
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,680
into a minus b cross a minus c which is

638
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,680
injective.

639
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,040
So this is the cardality of this set and

640
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,040
this is the cardality of that set. And

641
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,400
the reason that that this set is bigger

642
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,920
than that set is that we have an

643
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,480
injection from one into the other.

644
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,200
How does the injection work?

645
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,280
For every D in B minus C, we can choose.

646
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,839
So by definition, this D can be written

647
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,880
as somebody in B minus somebody in C.

648
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:04,640
Let's pick them. We choose B of D and B.

649
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:07,200
C of D C so that D is B of D minus C of

650
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,320
D.

651
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,599
Okay. Now what's our map?

652
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,400
V takes an A and a D. A lives here and D

653
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:22,160
lives there. We need to output somebody

654
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:26,640
in A minus B. So we take A minus B of D

655
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:30,079
and then A minus C of D.

656
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,680
So that is a map from here to here.

657
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:38,280
Why is it injective?

658
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,280
So to to check that it's injective.

659
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,839
So we're going to suppose

660
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:53,599
that v of a d is given to us. It's xy.

661
00:36:49,839 --> 00:37:00,720
And then we're going to find

662
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:04,680
A and D from X and Y

663
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,680
and from this choice.

664
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,160
So the choice we made once and for all,

665
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,400
we used it to build the map. And now we

666
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,480
have to prove that there's only one A

667
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,640
and D that give a certain X and Y here.

668
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,720
Okay. So how do we recover them? Well,

669
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:36,480
if you if this is X and this is Y, we

670
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:41,520
see that Y - X is B of D minus C of D,

671
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:44,400
which is D. So that's how we find D.

672
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,320
And once we find D, it's easy to find we

673
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,079
once we find D, then we know B of D and

674
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:59,320
C of D. And now it's easy to find A. Um,

675
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:59,320
so uh X uh minus X plus B of D is A.

676
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,200
It's very short. It feels a teeny bit

677
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,040
like a magic trick to me.

678
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,119
But so on this board and this board we

679
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,560
have seen that if the sum set is small

680
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,560
then the difference set is also small.

681
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Okay.

682
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Yeah.

683
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,320
uh you

684
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,800
like divide

685
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,160
by *

686
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,880
you get like something that looks

687
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,880
exactly like a triangle

688
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,880
way.

689
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,530
[Music]

690
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the question is

691
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,560
it's called Ruse's triangle inequality

692
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,480
and it sort of looks like if we take the

693
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,920
logarithm and play with this then

694
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,680
something will look like the triangle

695
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,280
inequality.

696
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,280
Um and uh yeah so Russa did have that in

697
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,920
mind when he named it that way. So he

698
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,320
produced a pseudo distance between

699
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,520
different sets say you know between A

700
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,000
and B or B and C or whatever. And this

701
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,400
um this translates into saying that the

702
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,079
rud rou pseudo distance obeys the

703
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,240
triangle inequality. The distance from B

704
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,280
to C is bounded by the distance from A

705
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,200
to B plus the different distance from

706
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,040
from B to A plus the distance from A to

707
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,880
C.

708
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,760
Um I'm not sure whether that is helpful

709
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,520
or or not. Um it's his pseudo distance

710
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,200
is a little bit funny. Like it's not

711
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,839
true that the distance from A to itself

712
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,400
is zero. So it's not quite like

713
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,240
distances that I'm used to. Um so that

714
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,240
intuition I don't know may or may not be

715
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,240
helpful.

716
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,800
Um I guess we will see tomorrow that

717
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,160
sometimes you use this many times like

718
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,640
how you know how how would you use the

719
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,040
triangle inequality? Well the distance

720
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,880
from A to Z is bounded by the distance

721
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,560
from A to B plus the distance from B to

722
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
C plus the distance from C to D D D D D

723
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:02,800
D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D

724
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,440
D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D

725
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,040
D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D and

726
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,320
maybe each of those things is easier to

727
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,320
understand and by the triangle

728
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,599
inequality, we can put them together. So

729
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,920
you can use this inequality in that way.

730
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,119
Um, and we'll see that tomorrow.

731
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:21,079
Tomorrow, Thursday.

732
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,079
Any other questions or comments?

733
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,839
>> Can I ask about the previous removing

734
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,839
denominator?

735
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:38,560
Just not sure how that works out. Does

736
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:41,119
it require something like this?

737
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,920
Um the question is about the removing

738
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,920
the denominator trick.

739
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,640
>> Um like when we had we had an a minus a

740
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,599
in the denominator and we multiplied it

741
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,599
out.

742
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,599
>> So that that was just um

743
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,599
algebra.

744
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,440
Um it's not it's not something fancy

745
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,359
like this.

746
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,680
Um

747
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,960
we'll u yeah let me bracket that we'll

748
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,599
see a little later something else with

749
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,079
removing denominators and and let's come

750
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,079
back to it then

751
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,319
do do you think did I understand your

752
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,160
question or

753
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,880
>> yeah I'm just not sure how that how how

754
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,720
that was actually

755
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,720
>> I think you only need six instead of

756
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,960
eight

757
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,200
Yeah, let's check in about it at the end

758
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,599
of class. Okay, the other important um

759
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,599
lema from from this field that went into

760
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,160
the proof of framan's theorem is called

761
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,160
Plunka inequality.

762
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,200
Plunka inequality allows us to say

763
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,240
things like if a plus a is small then a

764
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,240
plus a plus a is small.

765
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,560
So if A and B are subsets of Z in a

766
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,560
billion group

767
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,800
um and A + B is bounded by K * A

768
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,400
then

769
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,240
um okay let me make a little notation.

770
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,480
So sometimes we might want to talk about

771
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:39,760
b + b many times

772
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,960
um so let's say this is n times this is

773
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,240
sometimes written as n * b um although I

774
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:51,040
feel like that is slightly confusing um

775
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:55,400
so I have decided to adopt this notation

776
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,400
b like sum n times

777
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:10,920
okay so I could take b + m * - b + n *

778
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,920
and that's bounded by k to the m + n *

779
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,160
okay so let's do a few corlaries of this

780
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:24,160
um so just by plugging in a equals b we

781
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:29,760
see that if a + a is less than or equal

782
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:32,240
to k a um then a minus a is less less

783
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,720
than k^ 2 a. Uh that's actually the

784
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,720
correlary we already proved. Um but also

785
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:42,119
we could say a + a + a is bounded by k

786
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,119
cubed a

787
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,960
uh just plugging in a b and this is m is

788
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,079
three and n is zero and you can see you

789
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,960
can put higher powers here.

790
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,040
Also another corlary we can get is we

791
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,800
can switch the role of these guys in the

792
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:04,200
first corlary. So we can say if a minus

793
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,200
a is small

794
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,400
then a a plus a is also small.

795
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,640
So

796
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,640
proof is that b is negative a. So this

797
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,960
is a plus b and then this is basically b

798
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,960
plus b.

799
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,079
Okay.

800
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,599
Okay. Um,

801
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,280
we can also use this. So, we'll prove

802
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,599
this. That'll be our last big goal of

803
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,520
the class. Um but using

804
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,599
so this rera inequality and plunic

805
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,359
inequality have many many uses and one

806
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,200
simple use is we can use it to sort of

807
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,520
clean up and improve the statement of

808
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,960
our lema that fp if that has no

809
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,720
quantitative approximate sub fields. So

810
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,839
let me recall what we proved so far and

811
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,839
then we'll improve it a little bit.

812
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:33,040
Um so lma one was uh

813
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,520
if a is in fp

814
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,520
then either

815
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,240
um

816
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,240
a minus a over a minus a is all of fp

817
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,280
or

818
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,359
uh a * a min - a * A.

819
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,480
Okay. So now I can write this better. We

820
00:45:53,359 --> 00:46:00,960
have three or four of those

821
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:04,160
minus three or four of those

822
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,800
as it is.

823
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,560
Okay. So we can improve this in a way

824
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,040
that you don't need to have so many

825
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,200
different expressions floating around.

826
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:18,640
So we can say that if a is in fp

827
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,640
and the size of a is p to the s where s

828
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:28,240
is strictly less than one then the size

829
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:32,079
of a * a minus a * a is at least p to

830
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,680
the s plus epsilon of s.

831
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,240
And here you could you could put either

832
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,240
plus or minus.

833
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,359
And this epsilon of s is bigger than

834
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,599
zero.

835
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,200
So again it's continuous it's explicit

836
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,640
but it's a little bit messy and it's

837
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,160
it's a little bit small.

838
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,599
You take any subset which is

839
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,920
significantly smaller than the whole

840
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:59,520
field. If you do take a * a minus a * a

841
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,839
it will be significantly bigger than you

842
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,839
started with.

843
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,480
So, you know, if you just took a minus

844
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,040
a, that wouldn't be good enough because

845
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,560
a could be an arithmetic progression. It

846
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,960
might so that might have almost the same

847
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,960
size as a. If you just took a time a

848
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,480
that wouldn't be good enough because a

849
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:26,240
could be a geometric progression. Two 2

850
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,040
1 2 the 2 up to 2 to the l.

851
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,440
Um, but if you take both sums and

852
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,960
products, then you have to end up with

853
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,359
significantly more stuff than you

854
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,200
started with. Okay, so that's why this

855
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,880
is called sum product theory. If you

856
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
have both sums and products interacting

857
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:46,960
with each other, then something happens.

858
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,960
Okay, so uh proof

859
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,960
um

860
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,920
okay so if

861
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,839
um

862
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,200
okay so there there are two cases case

863
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,319
one and case two but I'm actually going

864
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,040
to do case two first.

865
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:08,040
So case

866
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,040
um

867
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,440
okay so it could be that a * a is

868
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,960
already much bigger than a then we just

869
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:25,200
declare victory. So if

870
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,280
a * a is bigger than a to the 1 + delta

871
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,640
then we declare victory and here delta

872
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,640
is going to be much smaller than epsilon

873
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,400
um

874
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,400
or maybe we could say okay otherwise

875
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,480
otherwise

876
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,480
um

877
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:53,680
uh otherwise a * a is basically the same

878
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:00,319
size as a.

879
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:03,359
Okay. Now, if a * a um plus a * a is

880
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,359
much bigger than a, then we declare

881
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,359
victory.

882
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,359
Uh where is I writing? Yeah, here. I

883
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,359
guess let's just put this

884
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,319
and we declare victory. Um otherwise

885
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:41,040
we would have a * a + a * a is smaller

886
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:43,440
than k a * a where k is like uh p to the

887
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,480
epsilon

888
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,480
and then we can use plunker

889
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:54,559
and that would tell us that a * a to a

890
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,400
big power

891
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,880
minus a * a to another big power

892
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:04,319
here. We could put

893
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:08,160
four. Um that would be bounded by k to

894
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:12,160
the eth a * a.

895
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,520
Um and so that would be bounded by maybe

896
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,079
um a * p to the tan epsilon or something

897
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,440
like that. And this contradicts the fact

898
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,440
that this we know this set is bigger.

899
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,920
Okay. And case one is similar but I

900
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,079
think maybe I'll make that an exercise.

901
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,480
You can just practice using pluna and

902
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,480
rua things.

903
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,760
Okay. And I'm going to do one more

904
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,839
correlary. Um so suppose you you know

905
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,440
you start with the set A and you start

906
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,680
multiplying and adding and subtracting

907
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,480
and see what you get and we've proven

908
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,520
that after you do after you do this

909
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,400
operation it gets a bit bigger

910
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,559
but suppose you don't just yeah

911
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,960
>> one question about this so you said that

912
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,240
kind of the idea is that if you have

913
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,599
sort of arithmetic progression or

914
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,160
geometric progression it can be small

915
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,559
but with both it has to be large. Is it

916
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,520
possible to prove that instead of the

917
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,400
the difference of a * a and a * a you

918
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,920
can just say a * a is large or a plus a

919
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,000
is large.

920
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,640
>> Okay. Yes. Great question. Okay. So the

921
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,480
question is so so in the theme of lema 2

922
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,960
is we tried to simplify as much as

923
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,119
possible the expression that we put here

924
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,079
and there is a suggestion um how to make

925
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,520
it as simple as possible. Um, so let me

926
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,839
I'm going to erase this proof and write

927
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,200
that as a as a I'll write it as a

928
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,800
theorem. It's a theorem.

929
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,119
So

930
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,119
even better

931
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,720
there is a theorem

932
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:09,280
um ban cat's towel.

933
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:13,280
So if a is subset of fp

934
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:17,359
uh a equ= p to the s0 less than or equal

935
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:22,480
to s less than 1 then

936
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:27,520
you could take um the maximum

937
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:30,160
of a + a and a * a

938
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:33,680
and that is bigger than p to the s plus

939
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,760
epsilon of s.

940
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,760
So this is better than this

941
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,760
qualitatively.

942
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,280
And actually the word sum product

943
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,040
inequality it could refer to a lot of

944
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,079
things but the the the inequality it

945
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,640
most often refers to is this one. So

946
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,920
either either the sums or the products

947
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,160
grow. Yeah, that's right. Okay. So all

948
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,079
the stuff we've seen are steps towards

949
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,240
the proof of this theorem. But there is

950
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,119
actually still some more ideas to get

951
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,880
all the way down to here. And we may or

952
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,480
may not end up doing it in the class.

953
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,079
It's unclear to me if getting all the

954
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,839
way down to there is actually uh

955
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,400
important in in projection theory.

956
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,559
Yeah. Cool.

957
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,960
Okay. So, one goal you might have in in

958
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,040
in simplifying and clarifying this story

959
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,720
is to make this expression as simple as

960
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:29,280
possible and get some gain. But another

961
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,559
goal that you might have is to make this

962
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,280
gain really large and perhaps this

963
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,680
expression will be more complicated and

964
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,200
you can also do that.

965
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,200
So let me make some uh notation.

966
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:50,720
Let's say poly k of a some sort of

967
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:54,240
polomials of complexity k. So I take a

968
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:57,599
to the k. So that's means I multiply

969
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,440
uh k different elements of a together

970
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:04,160
and then I add k things like that

971
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,160
together and then maybe I also want some

972
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,160
minuses

973
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:18,359
right so a a to the k is a * a * a k *

974
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,920
okay so these are polomials in A of

975
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,559
complexity

976
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,359
and uh another corlary which is at the

977
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,559
same level follows easily from this one

978
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:38,079
is that if we have zero less than s less

979
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:41,680
than t less than one and a is in fp. So

980
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:46,400
okay then there exists some k that only

981
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:50,880
depends on s and t. So that for any set

982
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:55,920
A in any FP where the size of A is P to

983
00:54:50,880 --> 00:55:00,040
the S, the size of poly K of A

984
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,040
is at least P to the T.

985
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:16,680
Okay. And the proof of this is is easy.

986
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,680
The proof is use lema too many times.

987
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:24,960
So I start with the set A. A * A minus A

988
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:28,559
* A is a bit bigger. Called this B. B *

989
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,800
B minus B * B is even a bit bigger.

990
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,119
And if you think about what B * B minus

991
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,200
B * B means, it would fit in like

992
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,920
probably four again.

993
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,920
And you keep doing this.

994
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,680
Okay, cool.

995
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,960
Cool.

996
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:55,040
Um so these these lemas theorems and

997
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,880
stuff they are important because um

998
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:59,440
and plumac's inequality and ruse's

999
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:04,079
inequality they are important

1000
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:07,440
um because um

1001
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,440
you so once we once we see so if we see

1002
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,599
something like a plus a is small that

1003
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,920
then that tells us that a has some

1004
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,920
structure and all these inequalities

1005
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,240
then imply that lots of other things are

1006
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,400
small. So it's sort of like a contagious

1007
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,000
structure like we start we input some

1008
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,720
structure but we find out more and more

1009
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,880
structure and that's a very useful tool

1010
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,000
and so lots of problems that we see in

1011
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,760
projection theory uh it seems to be

1012
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,440
helpful to try to phrase them in the

1013
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,760
form that some subset is small because

1014
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,960
then we can use Pluna's inequality and

1015
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,960
we can find out lots of other things.

1016
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,280
Okay. So in the last part of the class

1017
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,799
we will prove this inequality. This is

1018
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,799
the trickiest thing that we will prove

1019
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,799
today.

1020
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,200
All right. So the original proof of the

1021
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,920
pluna inequality was somewhat difficult.

1022
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,720
Um and there was a short proof that was

1023
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,079
given by Jorgus Petritus

1024
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:29,839
um about 10 or 15 years ago which is the

1025
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:32,839
one that I'll that I'll show.

1026
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,839
Okay.

1027
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,920
So it's based on a key lema.

1028
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:48,720
So the key lema says that if a + b is at

1029
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:53,359
most k * a

1030
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:57,200
then there's a subset x contained in a

1031
00:57:53,359 --> 00:58:00,799
so that for any set c

1032
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:07,799
x + c + b

1033
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:07,799
divided by x + c is also at most k.

1034
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,640
So okay by the way this top inequality

1035
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:16,480
of course we can divide by a. The top

1036
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:19,040
inequality says a + b over a is bounded

1037
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,400
by k.

1038
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:26,079
The lema says that if this is true

1039
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:30,400
then it's so if it's true for the set a

1040
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:32,640
then it's also true for the set x plus c

1041
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,880
where x is carefully chosen. I'll

1042
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,880
explain in a bit how it's chosen but c

1043
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,480
is a totally arbitrary set. So there are

1044
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,400
many choices for C. So there are many

1045
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,400
different you know this this is many

1046
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,400
inequalities

1047
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:53,839
right? Okay let me um tell you who X is

1048
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:58,400
which is an important idea in the proof.

1049
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:03,960
Um so first of all so x is a subset of a

1050
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,960
that we choose in order to minimize

1051
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,960
minimize the ratio x + b / x.

1052
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,200
So let me give an example that might

1053
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,400
help to motivate why you would want to

1054
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:25,119
look at this x.

1055
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,760
So suppose that a is the numbers from

1056
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:31,280
one up to 100

1057
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,520
which has a lot of additive structure

1058
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,079
together with some random number. So

1059
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,079
I've put a million

1060
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:44,799
and b is the numbers from one up to say

1061
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,400
50.

1062
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:50,400
Okay. So if you add A and B together,

1063
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,200
this stuff plus this stuff is quite

1064
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,880
small. There's a lot of structure there.

1065
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,880
Then there's this stuff plus this stuff

1066
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,319
that doesn't have any particular

1067
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,920
structure, but since there's only one

1068
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:02,480
stray element here, that's not so many

1069
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,240
of those either. So A plus B is pretty

1070
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,200
small.

1071
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,200
Now, who would X be?

1072
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:15,520
X is the subset of A which is chosen to

1073
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,400
minimize this ratio.

1074
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:21,400
and including this guy is not so

1075
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,400
helpful.

1076
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:28,520
Um so x would actually be here just the

1077
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,520
numbers from one up to 100.

1078
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,440
Okay. So I think perhaps that

1079
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,559
philosophically the point of doing this

1080
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,880
is identifying the part of A that really

1081
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,880
has the additive structure and throwing

1082
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,000
away possibly some parts of A that are

1083
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,839
not not that relevant.

1084
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,079
Okay. And then once you have found the

1085
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:55,839
heart of the matter here um then

1086
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,599
you can you can add anything else to it

1087
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:00,599
and you still have that amount of

1088
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,599
structure.

1089
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,720
Okay.

1090
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,480
All right. So, let's give a name. Let's

1091
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:30,559
say that. So, that's who X is. And let's

1092
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:33,200
say x + b / x is k lower bar which is at

1093
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:37,200
most k.

1094
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:39,119
So a + b over a is at most k and x is

1095
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,880
allowed to be all of a but we might

1096
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,839
choose a smaller set if we can make this

1097
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:47,440
ratio even smaller. So k bar is less

1098
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:49,440
than or equal to k. Okay. And really the

1099
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:56,400
key claim

1100
01:01:49,440 --> 01:02:00,040
is that x + c + b over x + c is at most

1101
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,040
k lower barc.

1102
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:13,160
Okay. So now we're going to prove the

1103
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,160
claim by induction.

1104
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,920
So we're going to prove the claim by

1105
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:23,599
induction

1106
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:28,640
on the cardality of C.

1107
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:32,720
And if the cardality of C is 1, then X +

1108
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:37,520
C + B is just X + B

1109
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:40,240
and X + C is just X. So if the cardality

1110
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,000
of C is one, I'm just shifting this set.

1111
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,240
and shifting that set doesn't change

1112
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,079
their cardalities.

1113
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,079
Okay. So now we can do the inductive

1114
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,079
step.

1115
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:06,000
All right. So let's say that C prime is

1116
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:09,680
C union one more guy. And by induction

1117
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:14,960
we know that it's true for C. So we know

1118
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:20,359
x + c + b is bounded by k lower bar x +

1119
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,359
c and we want to check for crop.

1120
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,000
All right.

1121
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,599
Okay. So the key character in this

1122
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:44,079
argument that Petrus came up with

1123
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:48,640
is a set y which is the set of x and x.

1124
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:53,039
So that x + little c + b is contained in

1125
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:57,240
big x plus big c plus b. Let's see how

1126
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:57,240
that naturally comes up.

1127
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,119
Right.

1128
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,119
All right.

1129
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:13,920
So we we we're thinking about x plus c

1130
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,079
prime plus b. We want to see that it's

1131
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,760
not too big. And we're using induction.

1132
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:22,000
So we want to see how it changes when we

1133
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:27,680
added this one guy. So this is the

1134
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,319
previous guy x + c + b plus um

1135
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:34,240
the new ones.

1136
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:34,240
And I want them to be really new.

1137
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,160
So, here are some new elements that live

1138
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,280
here. And I'm going to take out any

1139
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,280
elements I've already counted,

1140
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,799
right?

1141
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:55,760
Sorry. Um,

1142
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:59,839
how, um, I don't quite understand the

1143
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:03,520
definition of y. How can x plus c plus b

1144
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:07,599
not be a subset of x plus c plus b?

1145
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:11,680
>> Right? So this uh so c prime is a

1146
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:14,319
previous set c union with some little c

1147
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,920
>> and little c is not in big c.

1148
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:18,640
>> Okay. Now I have to write all the little

1149
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:22,799
c's and big c's really carefully. But

1150
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:25,760
this is a little c and this is a big c.

1151
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:28,400
Cool. Okay. So this X is automatically

1152
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,039
in big X but in a failure of

1153
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,839
functorality of not of notation little C

1154
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,839
is not in big C.

1155
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:41,720
All right.

1156
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,720
All right.

1157
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:49,599
Okay. Now, one thing to note about this

1158
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,039
definition that helps to motivate it is

1159
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:58,839
that y + little c plus big b is

1160
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:58,839
contained in x plus big c plus big b

1161
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,119
because for each element of y, little y

1162
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,440
plus little c plus big b is defined to

1163
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,440
be in here.

1164
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:23,240
So this is at most x + c + b plus

1165
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:23,240
x + c + b take away y + c + b.

1166
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:32,640
All of these were already counted. So

1167
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:39,680
there are at most this many new guys.

1168
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:44,799
All right. And this is x + c + b + x + b

1169
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:47,839
- y + b because this is a subset of this

1170
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:50,960
and the plus c just translates things.

1171
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:52,640
So I have so this thing is that big and

1172
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,520
I remove from it this thing which is

1173
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,720
that big.

1174
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,720
So that's the upper bound for um the

1175
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,720
numerator.

1176
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,760
Okay.

1177
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:08,480
Um,

1178
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,960
so I'm I'm trying to bound this thing

1179
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,319
with a C prime. I need I want to prove

1180
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,079
an upper bound. So I need an upper bound

1181
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,240
for the numerator and a lower bound for

1182
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,240
the denominator.

1183
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,599
Okay,

1184
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,920
so the denominator is x +

1185
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:53,280
uh c prime

1186
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:56,160
and so that's x + c plus um the the set

1187
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,760
how many x and x. So that little x plus

1188
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:02,720
little c is not contained in big x plus

1189
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:05,839
big c.

1190
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,240
So it's the guys I already had and then

1191
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:10,720
I have guys of the format little x plus

1192
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,520
little c. And I only want the new ones,

1193
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,159
the ones that aren't already counted.

1194
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:24,560
That's an equality. And I'm gonna write

1195
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:30,440
it as x + c plus x minus the x and x. So

1196
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,440
that x + c is an x plus c.

1197
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:41,960
Okay. And now key observation is that

1198
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,960
these guys are all in y.

1199
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,000
This is a subset of y.

1200
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:52,719
Right? Because if little x plus little c

1201
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:56,000
is in big x plus big c. Um so if little

1202
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:57,839
x plus little c is in big x plus big c

1203
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,920
then I can add b to both sides and this

1204
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:03,799
is in there.

1205
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,799
So those are all in y.

1206
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:10,960
So this is a subset of y. So the size of

1207
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,719
this guy is at most the size of y. And

1208
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:19,880
since I'm subtracting here, I can say

1209
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:19,880
this is at least x + c + x minus y.

1210
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,440
Okay.

1211
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,319
So now we'll just put together

1212
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,319
everything that we know.

1213
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:46,719
Okay. We know that x + c + b over x + c

1214
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:49,719
is at most k bar. We know that by

1215
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,719
induction.

1216
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:59,280
We know that x + b / x is equal to k

1217
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:03,080
bar. We know that by definition. That's

1218
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,080
just what k bar was.

1219
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:11,360
And we know that y + b over y is greater

1220
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,480
than or equal to k bar. That was the

1221
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,719
definition of x. x was chosen to

1222
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,719
minimize this ratio.

1223
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,320
Y might perhaps be equal to x, but

1224
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:24,360
that's that's okay anyway. But it's

1225
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,360
never going to be any smaller.

1226
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:35,199
Okay? And so therefore by algebra by how

1227
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:39,280
fractions work x + c + b. Okay. So so

1228
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:43,360
now I can say I I want to say x + c

1229
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:45,760
prime + b over x + c prime. And I want

1230
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:49,040
an upper bound for that.

1231
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:54,159
Okay. So the numerator is bounded by 1.

1232
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:56,719
x + c + b + x + b

1233
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:59,280
minus y + b.

1234
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:07,640
And the denominator is lower bounded by

1235
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:07,640
part two and it's x + c + x - y.

1236
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:16,360
And then because each of these ratios

1237
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,360
has the correct sign, this is at most k.

1238
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,719
Yeah. So this is short. It is a little

1239
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,400
tricky and I must admit I don't quite

1240
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,400
understand how Petrus thought to do

1241
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,400
this.

1242
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,159
Um

1243
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,840
Okay. So from the key lama we can prove

1244
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:08,719
uh plunic's inequality

1245
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,320
and then see if anybody

1246
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,480
yeah if you have room you can turn turn

1247
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,400
over in your mind

1248
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,120
why did philosophically why did this

1249
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,560
work out so nicely. If anybody has

1250
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,560
thoughts about it I would be happy to

1251
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,560
hear.

1252
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:28,240
[Applause]

1253
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:47,760
Okay. So, proof. Okay. So, say we're

1254
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,760
starting with this.

1255
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,760
Um

1256
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,719
so by the main the main we use our main

1257
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,960
lema.

1258
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:05,440
So it tells us that there exists some x

1259
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:09,760
and a and we have x + c + b at most k *

1260
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:12,239
x + c for any c.

1261
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,239
How might we use this?

1262
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,239
Um

1263
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:23,600
right. So okay, C could be empty. So we

1264
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:29,040
get X + B is at most K * X.

1265
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:33,600
C could be B. So we get X + B + B.

1266
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,239
That's at most K * X + B.

1267
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:41,239
And X plus B was at most K * X. So

1268
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:41,239
that's at most K 2 * X.

1269
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,920
Okay. And you can see where this goes.

1270
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:49,120
So I'll do one more. you'll get the

1271
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:53,120
pattern. If I add one more b, that's at

1272
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:55,040
most k x plus b plus b. Plug in what I

1273
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:00,400
already know about this. That's at most

1274
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:06,679
k cub * x. All right. So if I add x + m

1275
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,679
copies of b, that will be at most k * x.

1276
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:13,440
Okay.

1277
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:16,800
And then uh

1278
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:19,920
we'll use the roua inequality. So this

1279
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:23,040
is already you know if um

1280
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:27,440
uh this is already pretty good thing uh

1281
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:31,040
like if a equals b here then I could say

1282
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,719
a to the m is bounded by k to the m * a

1283
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,640
right because a to the a to the m is

1284
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:38,080
obviously at least as big as x plus a to

1285
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:40,159
the m. So I get a the m is bounded by k

1286
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,760
the m * a. That's a typical correlary of

1287
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:44,640
Pluner.

1288
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,199
Anyway, to get the uh advertised finale,

1289
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:51,800
we use Ruse's inequality.

1290
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:51,800
Ruser was a times

1291
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:04,000
there.

1292
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:06,560
So can plug in um

1293
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:16,239
uh

1294
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:19,520
I say so x * b + m - b + n is bounded by

1295
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:24,840
x + b + m

1296
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,840
x + b + n.

1297
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:30,320
Uh

1298
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:34,000
and then we plug in each of these and we

1299
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:37,040
get k to the m + n

1300
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,040
* x*

1301
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,040
x².

1302
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:50,239
Yeah, that's right. Okay. So then I uh

1303
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:54,640
get this by itself. So b + m - b + n is

1304
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:58,320
bounded by k m + n * x which is bounded

1305
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:01,480
by k the m + n * a because x is a subset

1306
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,480
of a

1307
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:28,239
Okay, so this proof is short. It is a

1308
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,040
little tricky, but I think it is well

1309
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:33,120
worth spending some time with uh because

1310
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,520
this inequality is really quite

1311
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,920
important. I would say that it plays

1312
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,840
really a key role in all the later

1313
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,000
developments in projection theory and

1314
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,600
the solution to the CA problem in a lot

1315
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,960
of things.

1316
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:49,040
Um and uh so as we keep going, you know,

1317
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,360
tomorrow, Thursday, and so on, we'll

1318
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,280
reflect more about why this is useful

1319
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:57,040
and important. Um and um maybe I'll try

1320
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:00,159
to come up with some homework to try to

1321
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:03,159
reflect on on uh how this proof got put

1322
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:03,159
together.
