1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
So I I decided to teach 18156 this

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
semester about something called

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,840
projection theory. Um I think that

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
projection theory although it's not

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
usually highlighted in graduate real

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,400
analysis is a fairly fundamental thing

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
in analysis a little bit like like the

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,840
isoparametric inequality or the solef

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
inequality. maybe not quite that

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
fundamental, but uh but a a fairly basic

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,680
thing that comes up in a lot of

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,879
different places. Um and um I was

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,879
excited to teach you about it this

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:46,480
semester for a few reasons. Um uh so one

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,399
is that some some of the like core basic

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,399
question one of the core basic questions

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
in projection theory was just figured

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,120
out in the last couple years and it's

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,920
something that I'm excited about

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
learning about. Um so I wanted to so for

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
so that was one reason I was excited to

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
teach about it and the other reason is

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,080
that I have gradually seen it appearing

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,720
in more and more different places. Um

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,479
and so I wanted to sort of highlight the

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,119
way it comes up in a bunch of different

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,320
parts of math.

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,400
Um so today in the first class I'm going

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
to tell you do like an overview of

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
projection theory. I'm going to tell you

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
what like what it is um what the

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
questions are and um about some of the

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
different applications and maybe a

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,640
little bit about some of the different

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,640
ways we think about it.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Okay.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
I guess it's a little crowded in the

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,520
back. Uh are we I guess the seats are

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
full. I'm going to start slowly. So if

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
you want if you want to grab a chair or

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
anything, feel free.

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,520
Okay.

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,520
So,

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,959
okay. So, the setup is that we are in RD

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
or maybe also a vector space over

46
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,200
another field later. And then we have

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,200
orthogonal projections. So V in RD is a

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,200
subspace

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,440
and pi subv is the orthogonal

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,440
projection.

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,319
Okay. Um and so so what we're going to

52
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,519
do is we're going to consider some set X

53
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,640
and RD and then you can take the

54
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,400
orthogonal projection of X in many

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,319
different directions for many different

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
V

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,480
um and we sort of study how that all

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
fits together

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,800
X and this guy

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,200
for

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,200
many different

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,280
So a slightly corny metaphor for what

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,360
we're doing is we're studying some set

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,920
and you can kind of look at the set from

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,360
many different directions. Um and we

66
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,640
want to uh sort of uh put together the

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
information from these different points

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,080
of view.

69
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,080
All right. So let me make a picture.

70
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,599
Um

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,640
red

72
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
So we'll come back to this picture a

73
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,040
bunch.

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,040
So maybe X is a set of red dots.

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,159
Okay. And then we can take the

76
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,720
projection of this set X onto different

77
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,159
planes.

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,000
So if I draw sort of a I'll draw one

79
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,319
plane over here. And if I project X onto

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,319
this plane.

81
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,349
[Applause]

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,159
Okay. Then I will get this.

83
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,519
So there is pi V1 of X.

84
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,199
Okay. But I have rigged this. So if I

85
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,520
project it onto a different plane,

86
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,330
something uh a bit interesting will

87
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,529
happen.

88
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,529
[Applause]

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
Okay.

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,440
So

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,880
here is a a different plane V2. And if I

92
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,880
project my set onto V2,

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
all of those points will kind of line up

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,720
on top of each other.

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,919
And all of those points will kind of

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,919
line up on top of each other.

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,720
And all of these points kind of line up

98
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,720
on top of each other.

99
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,880
Okay.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,880
So here are my observations about this

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,880
situation.

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,560
So x itself is eight dots. And when I

103
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,120
projected x onto v1, there was still

104
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,360
eight dots.

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,240
But when I projected it onto v2, there

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,720
were only three dots because there were

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,919
a lot of coincidences where dots got

108
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,880
pushed on top of each other.

109
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,759
Okay. Now uh intuitively v2 is kind of

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,160
special and v_sub_1 is more typical. So

111
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
most most of the v's will be like v1 but

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,960
there'll be a few exceptional ones that

113
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,960
are like v2.

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,080
So intuition

115
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:03,039
is that uh v2

116
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:06,560
uh type situation is rare

117
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,840
and one of our goals is to make that

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,759
precise make a precise question and and

119
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,080
say precisely how rare is that sort of

120
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,080
behavior.

121
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,319
Okay. So, so informally if the set X is

122
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
kind of spread out, most of its

123
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,639
projections will also be kind of spread

124
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,440
out. There could be a few projections

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,520
where X gets kind of squished together.

126
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,400
And a projection estimate means we'll

127
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,080
try to quantify how often that happens

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,840
and show that it's rare.

129
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,960
Okay. So we will u make this precise in

130
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,600
a bunch of different ways. Um and um I

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,680
think the the most uh simple to ask

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,680
question is when the set x is a finite

133
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,680
set.

134
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,240
So so now let's suppose that x is a

135
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,680
finite set.

136
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,319
Okay. And I'm going to use a notation

137
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,440
that absolute value of x is the

138
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,440
cardality of x.

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
Okay.

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Um

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,400
all right. So here's my setup. I'm going

142
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:37,840
to take X in R2

143
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,560
and E subs of X is going to be the set

144
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,479
of V. Oh, let me actually let me mention

145
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,599
another piece of notation. So, you know,

146
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,759
we're going to talk about all these

147
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,840
different subspaces V. So, there's a

148
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,840
name for the family of all subspaces.

149
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,880
It's called the Grossmanian.

150
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,759
Um so another piece of grossman is

151
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,319
notation is that the grossmanian of k

152
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:03,840
planes in RD

153
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:06,080
this is the set of uh v and rd where v

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,080
is a kdimensional

155
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
subspace

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,120
okay so e subs

157
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,319
is the set of v these are going to be

158
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,400
one-dimensional subspaces in R2

159
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,160
with the property

160
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,680
that

161
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,680
the cardality of pi v ofx is at most s.

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Okay, so going back to our basic

163
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,200
picture, if these red dots were just

164
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,240
points, um then this v2 would be in e

165
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,240
sub3 of x because pi v2 is only three

166
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,240
points.

167
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,920
Okay.

168
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,480
So the first question if you like of

169
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,640
projection theory would be estimate

170
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,519
how many of these directions there are

171
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,880
the size of E s of X

172
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:11,560
in terms of

173
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,560
S and the size of X.

174
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,399
Okay.

175
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,519
So, what would be an interesting set X

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,160
to consider? What would be a set X of of

177
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,760
points or red dots that in many

178
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,320
different directions things would get

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,320
squished a lot?

180
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,160
Do people have any thoughts? What would

181
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,959
be an interesting X to look at?

182
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
>> Grid.

183
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,760
>> A grid. Yeah. Okay. So as an example,

184
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,760
let's look at a square grid.

185
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,000
So x is going to be the set of pairs a b

186
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,800
where a and b are integers and they go

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,800
from one up to n.

188
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,640
Okay, good. So, this set has small

189
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,720
projections in a bunch of different

190
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,720
directions. Let me make a a little bit

191
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
bigger.

192
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,079
Um, okay. So, so X has n squared points,

193
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
16 points in my picture. If I project it

194
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,399
down, I only get four points. If I

195
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
project it to the side, I only get four

196
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,600
points.

197
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,959
Um, if I project it at 45 degrees, I

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,079
also get rather few points.

199
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,240
Um, I project it at 45 degrees, the

200
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
fibers of the projection will look like

201
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
this.

202
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,399
And they'll each have many points.

203
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,640
And so, the projection itself will be

204
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,640
pretty small.

205
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,920
Are there other angles as well

206
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,320
where I could project it and uh it would

207
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,320
be pretty small?

208
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,120
>> Yeah, some rational angles. Yes. Okay.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,600
So

210
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,320
if we project

211
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,320
x at a rational angle

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,560
um then uh

213
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,279
high v of x would be small.

214
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,959
I'll draw one more um which I think is

215
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,120
enough to get the to get the idea.

216
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,440
I remember when I first saw it I I could

217
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,000
see the 45 degrees and the vertical and

218
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,440
the horizontal. Um so if I project it

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,800
perpendicular to these orange lines

220
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,360
where it has slope like left one and up

221
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,360
two.

222
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Um

223
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,639
all of those fibers will will also be

224
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,880
large and so that projection will also

225
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,880
be small.

226
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,000
Right?

227
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,839
Okay. Um cool. So we will compute it

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
tomorrow in the overview class. I'm not

229
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,120
going to do computations with you. But

230
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,360
if you do that, you will find the

231
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:43,440
following thing that ES of X

232
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,519
is around S^2 over the size of X for a

233
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,519
big range of of values of S.

234
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,680
So in between X to the half and say half

235
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,680
of X.

236
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,120
Yeah, for the grid.

237
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,279
Okay. Um, Erdos did basically this

238
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,760
computation in the 1960s and he made a

239
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,160
conjecture that the grid is the shape

240
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
that makes these the biggest. He said

241
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,279
slightly different language, but his

242
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,440
conjecture implied that the grid is the

243
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,000
configuration that makes these sets the

244
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,920
largest. Um and that turned out to be

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,959
true and it was proven in the early 80s

246
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,959
by Sami and Troder.

247
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:47,959
So they proved that if X is in R2 and S

248
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,959
is at most size of X over two um then

249
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,760
the size of ES of X is at most is at

250
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,240
most 1 plus a constant times what you

251
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,240
see for the grid.

252
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
Okay, so this can be considered in a way

253
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,880
one of the fundamental theorems of

254
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,279
projection theory. Um and I'll mention a

255
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,839
couple interesting things about the the

256
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,079
proof. Um okay so one so one thing is

257
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,160
the background of these people Erid Sami

258
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,240
and Troder um the these are people who

259
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,600
come from cominatorics. So this theorem

260
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
represents a connection between

261
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
combinotaurics and and projection theory

262
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,600
and we'll talk about some other aspects

263
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,320
as we go along. Um however this proof is

264
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,680
is not a

265
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
at least at the time was not a

266
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
traditional combinatorial proof. So they

267
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
first played around with a lot of

268
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
cominatorial things double counting and

269
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,120
things like that and they couldn't prove

270
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,480
it. Um and then the proof eventually

271
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
uses in a crucial way the topology of R2

272
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,440
a sort of interesting uh connection

273
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,880
between um topology and and and this

274
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,279
stuff. Um so I I'll just put here proof

275
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,279
based on topology.

276
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,480
Okay.

277
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
So this story uh is one important story

278
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,320
in projection theory but it's a very

279
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,000
discreet story about finite sets and

280
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,839
there's another more continuous more

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,160
analytic story which will be important

282
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,480
in our class um where instead of taking

283
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,760
a finite set and projecting it we take a

284
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
function which you can think of as like

285
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,000
a density function

286
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
before I transition there actually let

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,120
me pause here and see if there are there

288
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,120
any questions or comments so far.

289
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,880
>> Yeah. Um so for that theorem that the

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,839
grid is kind of the maximizes es of x

291
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,120
like is is that like kind of the the

292
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,720
only example or a kind of big class of

293
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,079
other examples that also reach that

294
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,040
bound.

295
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,880
>> Okay cool. So the question is um is the

296
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,639
grid the only example that's kind of

297
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,519
tight for this theorem or are there lots

298
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
of other examples? Yeah. So another

299
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
actually a third thing I like about

300
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,720
projection theory is that it's it's full

301
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,959
of open questions. So it is a

302
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,880
long-standing open question whether the

303
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,240
grid is basically the only example or

304
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,759
whether there are lots of others. Um in

305
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,279
terms of other examples that we know

306
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,639
about there are a few but I would

307
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,560
describe them all as very minor

308
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,120
variations on the grid and we can meet

309
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,800
them as we go along. Um but in terms of

310
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,600
a theorem in the other direction we know

311
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,040
very little. So it could it may or may

312
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,680
not be the case that there are many more

313
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,680
examples out there.

314
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,560
Nice. Um, other questions?

315
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,079
Okay, great. So, okay. So, now let me

316
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,079
describe a much more analytic framework

317
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,240
that also involves projections and and

318
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,880
we'll see that it's sort of related that

319
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,880
it's related to this.

320
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,000
[Applause]

321
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

322
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,439
So now instead of having a set suppose I

323
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,840
have a function on R and D say complex

324
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,320
value um and um I'd like you to

325
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,480
visualize this as a density function.

326
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,280
Um, so actually a good a good thing to

327
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,520
picture is a cat scan. So inside of your

328
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,840
body there's

329
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,840
something that they'd like to scan. Uh,

330
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,720
where are the bones or something? And

331
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,320
um, uh, and so there's a like some

332
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,640
density of that thing. Um, and then the

333
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,000
cat scan will shoot rays through your

334
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,679
bodies in different in different

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
directions and it will integral of that

336
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,000
function along the ray.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,280
Um and um uh so if you you know if you

338
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
stand in front of a screen maybe you

339
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,080
just have an X-ray X-rays go through and

340
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,120
what you see on the screen is the amount

341
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,120
of stuff that that that that X-ray went

342
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,120
through. Okay. So that's what we'd like

343
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:24,400
to do with this function. Um all right.

344
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:28,240
So suppose here is our subspace V and if

345
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,520
I have a point in it Y um then the

346
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,679
orthogonal projection maps this fiber

347
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,280
onto Y. So that there is pi V inverse of

348
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,679
Y.

349
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,679
So pi v inverse of y will be an aphine

350
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,679
subspace

351
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,280
and it has a volume measure

352
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,080
which I'm going to call dv volume um

353
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,760
subf the letter f stands for fiber it's

354
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,760
just to distinguish it from dv volume

355
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,000
which might mean the volume on the whole

356
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,840
space

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,520
okay so then the way I will define the

358
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:14,120
projection of the function of y is I

359
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,120
will integrate over the fiber

360
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,919
f ofx d volume of the fiber.

361
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,080
So another way to think about this uh

362
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,000
projection of the function um is that if

363
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,720
I were to integrate

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,320
the projection of f

365
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:38,559
um on some set u in the in the fiber.

366
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,799
So maybe over here I have a subset u in

367
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,799
my fiber.

368
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,280
>> Um

369
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,799
yeah, it's a dv volume of the fiber of

370
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,799
y. Yeah, this thing you could call dy.

371
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Uh

372
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,120
is that okay?

373
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:10,840
Then this would be equal to the integral

374
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,840
over the pre-image of u of f ofx dx

375
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,200
d oh I'm sorry you are right. Yes that

376
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,720
should not be d volume of the fiber.

377
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,559
Yeah thanks l. Right. So this so yeah

378
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,200
this is just dy or if you wanted to put

379
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,400
d of something it should be dv volume in

380
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,360
the space v of y but not in the fire.

381
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,760
That's absolutely right. what I wrote

382
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,760
made no sense.

383
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,600
Yeah. So if you if you integrate uh the

384
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,520
projection of f over this region u

385
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,760
that's the integral of f over the the

386
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,760
whole parameter.

387
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,840
Okay.

388
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,640
So do you feel like you have a a an

389
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,640
image of what this means?

390
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,159
Okay. Okay. So now we can play the same

391
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
game. We start with a function and then

392
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,919
you can consider many different

393
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,480
projections of this function.

394
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,720
Um and there's a phenomenon which is

395
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,360
similar to this phenomenon.

396
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,080
Um but the way it plays out in this

397
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,880
setting of functions is that most of the

398
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,440
projections are smoother than the

399
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,000
original function. And I'll illustrate

400
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,000
that with a proposition.

401
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:37,280
So proposition

402
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,159
um if f is just an L2 function in R

403
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,360
seven

404
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:47,200
um then

405
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:52,159
for almost every V which is a

406
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,960
onedimensional subspace in R seven

407
00:21:52,159 --> 00:22:00,520
if you look at the projection of F on to

408
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,520
V uh it is a C2 function.

409
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,120
So this function on R seven is an L2. It

410
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
doesn't have to be continuous anywhere.

411
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,919
Certainly doesn't have to be

412
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,840
differentiable.

413
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,080
You project it onto various

414
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,919
one-dimensional subspaces.

415
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,480
Now not everyone there are there are

416
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,840
some bad ones where it's only L2 or

417
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,280
maybe even worse. Um but for most of

418
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,480
them the projection is C2

419
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,080
and if you play around with these

420
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,120
numbers if you make this bigger you can

421
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,440
make it even smoother.

422
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,520
Okay so I want to try to Yeah.

423
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
>> What's special about our seven here that

424
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,960
makes this true?

425
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,200
>> Uh seven is not that special but

426
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,120
increasing this number uh makes it

427
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,880
smoother.

428
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,760
>> Yeah. So it's I mean there are similar

429
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,400
theorems in any dimension.

430
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Yeah.

431
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,760
Um, okay. So,

432
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,799
so let me try to give some intuition

433
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,159
about why that is and uh to try to

434
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,240
convince you that that is a closely

435
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,760
related phenomenon to the phenomenon

436
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,799
that we started with that that appears

437
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,120
in the semary trarthur.

438
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,799
Okay. So, what's um what's the intuition

439
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,799
about this? So I have this

440
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,520
highdimensional function which is quite

441
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,120
irregular and um because it's quite

442
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,960
irregular you could picture it having

443
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,799
many peaks and valleys being very

444
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,200
jagged.

445
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,640
But then when you integrate it over the

446
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,760
fibers if you integrate both a peak and

447
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,600
a valley they cancel each other out. So

448
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
a lot of those peaks and valleys cancel

449
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,559
each other out and you could hope to be

450
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:47,440
left with something smoother. All

451
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,559
right, let's try to make a a picture.

452
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
I got a picture. I'm going to erase

453
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,080
this, but I'm going to draw a very

454
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,080
similar picture.

455
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,200
All right. So, in my picture, my f is

456
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,919
going to have it's going to have uh

457
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,720
peaks

458
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,000
on the red dots just to help me

459
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
visualize. So this function doesn't

460
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,279
exactly have valleys. It's like to

461
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,080
picture a flat landscape but with lots

462
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,919
of little peaks. Um and so here are some

463
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,919
red dots to make them a little bit

464
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,919
fatter.

465
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
Okay. So I think I'm not going to try to

466
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
draw the function, but if you what I

467
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,840
want you to visualize is like there's

468
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,760
the plane of the blackboard and then

469
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,240
there's like a peak coming out over each

470
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,400
of these things.

471
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,200
Okay. Now

472
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,039
let's try to visualize what happens when

473
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,720
I project onto this space V. And in

474
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:57,520
yellow I'm going to draw um the function

475
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:01,559
pi V of F. Okay. So um to help myself

476
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,559
draw put some little guidelines.

477
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,159
Okay. So out here pi V of F is just zero

478
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,600
because there were no peaks. And then

479
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,600
it's going to go up as I see this peak.

480
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,159
And then as I get here, there there are

481
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,159
two peaks. So that's even taller. And

482
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,600
then here a little shorter. Here a

483
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,320
little taller. A little shorter.

484
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,320
Looks something like that.

485
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,200
You might notice already that this is

486
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,039
not as jagged as the original thing.

487
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,919
Actually, probably it would be better if

488
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,919
I did something like this.

489
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,919
And because of sort of the law of

490
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
averages, if I stick these around or if

491
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,480
I stick them around randomly, then

492
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
because of the law of averages, this

493
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
will be pretty steady.

494
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
And even if I don't pick them randomly,

495
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
if I choose V randomly, there's a

496
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,840
certain amount of the law of averages,

497
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,919
and this is going to look relatively

498
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,039
steady.

499
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,240
Okay. Um,

500
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,279
cool. Okay. So qualitatively this is

501
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:12,080
kind of similar to the sum trot theorem.

502
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:14,240
It says that uh there are only a few bad

503
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,880
directions and except for those bad

504
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,240
directions when I project this down I

505
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,799
will see um I will see things kind of

506
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,799
averaging out.

507
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,960
Okay. Um, and this this proposition is

508
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
one way to make it precise, but actually

509
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,320
we'll spend some time thinking together

510
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,320
about various ways to make this precise

511
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,600
questions or comments.

512
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,600
>> Yeah.

513
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,360
>> Is it like possible to prove statements

514
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,559
like this based on the

515
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,360
versions? Yeah, good question. Okay, so

516
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,279
the question is um can we go back and

517
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,679
forth between these two worlds? Can we

518
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,360
take say the summer troder theorem or

519
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,240
something like that and use it to prove

520
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,919
some continuous estimates or vice versa?

521
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,200
Can we take some continuous estimates

522
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,919
and use it to prove things like this?

523
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,360
Yeah. Um

524
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,159
okay. So both of those things are

525
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,799
sometimes possible. Um but both of those

526
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,880
things h have some difficulties and in

527
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,919
particular there's a big story in the in

528
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,960
the field in the class um that people

529
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,200
spent a lot of energy trying to

530
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:41,120
translate this into the continuous

531
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,720
setting um and um and the the original

532
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,039
proof doesn't definitely doesn't work

533
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,520
and and and and we had to think a lot.

534
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,120
So, um, maybe we'll come back to that a

535
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,360
little later in the class, but there's a

536
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,000
a story I want to share with you about

537
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,919
how it's difficult to get from this

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,679
discrete setting to the continuous

539
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,679
setting.

540
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,679
Yeah.

541
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,559
Okay. Um,

542
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,000
actually, let me say a little bit more.

543
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,240
So you know th this example is really

544
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,480
pretty typical. So you you can suppose

545
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,640
that your function is a sum of bumps on

546
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,159
different little balls. And so it is

547
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
just a question about how how these

548
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,960
different balls small balls are

549
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,559
projecting down. And it sounds at first

550
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,799
very similar to have like a bunch of

551
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,480
delta balls and project them down to

552
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,440
have like a bunch of points and project

553
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,520
them down. But the thickness of the

554
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,559
balls is really important and it makes

555
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,559
it it it it um um

556
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,480
it makes it makes things different in

557
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,960
ways that we'll talk about.

558
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,399
>> Yeah.

559
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
>> Sorry, but you might say a bit more

560
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,080
about So if I understand correctly,

561
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,799
you're saying in the typical case

562
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,919
setting you have some in the typical

563
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,240
case in the discrete setting, you

564
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,640
recover all the points.

565
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,640
Could you say a bit more?

566
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,279
>> Yeah. Okay. Great. Great. Okay. So the

567
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,120
question is so the observation is that

568
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,840
um in the discrete setting we had a

569
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,480
theorem that says in for most directions

570
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,880
of projections the images of the points

571
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,360
are uh different from each other. They

572
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,200
they stay spread out and in the

573
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,880
continuous case we said something else

574
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,600
that if you have a bunch of these of

575
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,679
these peaks then in most directions when

576
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,559
you project things kind of average out

577
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,880
and are spaced evenly. And how are those

578
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,760
two things connected to each other?

579
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah, that's a great a great question.

580
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,480
Um,

581
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,279
uh, okay. So, so one part of it I think

582
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,880
is kind of clear. One part of it I I can

583
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,440
explain easily and then this won't be

584
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,480
everything. But if my if my balls were

585
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,480
arranged in such a way that when I

586
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
projected

587
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,200
um, they went on top of each other. So

588
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,799
right then the projection of my function

589
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,159
would be really big here and then it

590
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,840
would be zero. Then it would be really

591
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,600
big here and it would be zero and then

592
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,799
it would be really big there. So that

593
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,080
would not be smooth. It would be

594
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,159
oscillating violently. So if you have a

595
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,000
direction which is bad in the sense that

596
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,520
these balls are landing on top of each

597
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,600
other then it will be bad for this

598
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,880
analysis problem.

599
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,880
Okay. But um

600
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,840
uh but uh a set could be bad for this

601
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,880
analysis problem in another way that you

602
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,480
know there could be like two balls over

603
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,960
here and one ball over there and two

604
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,480
balls over here and one ball over there

605
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,120
and then the density would still be

606
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,679
oscillating a lot but the image wouldn't

607
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,440
be particularly small.

608
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,000
Um so okay so that that will require

609
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,240
some additional ideas. Uh but it still

610
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,399
turns out to be the case that trying to

611
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,159
prove stuff about this um the ideas the

612
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,960
ideas from ruling out this case are are

613
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,240
are related.

614
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,039
>> Yeah

615
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,039
>> probably relates exactly to the problem

616
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,840
relating these two. But is there an

617
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:12,000
analog for distributions?

618
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,320
Um yeah um yes there's an analog for

619
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,320
distributions. Um so okay so the

620
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,760
question is what if f was a distribution

621
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,720
instead of a function? Maybe it was

622
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,159
something messier than being an L2. Um,

623
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,960
so, uh, yeah, you you could still say

624
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,960
things. Um,

625
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,600
um, I wasn't planning. So, um,

626
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,120
so I I think all of those questions you

627
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,919
can reduce to something about how how

628
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,360
balls get projected and then if you if

629
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,360
you want to you can say something about

630
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
distributions.

631
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,480
Okay.

632
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,480
Okay, so the next character in the story

633
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,519
I wanted to mention to you is the Forier

634
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,519
transform that in this continuous setup

635
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,600
there's a very close connection between

636
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,080
this projection operation and the forier

637
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,279
transform. Um and that that brings fora

638
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,279
analysis into projection theory.

639
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,430
[Applause]

640
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,279
All right.

641
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,159
Okay. Um so the connection with the fora

642
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,519
transform is the following lama.

643
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,840
Well, actually, let me make a Yeah.

644
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,640
Um,

645
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,519
okay. So, here's our space RD and in

646
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,080
there we have our subspace V. So, our

647
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,679
function F lives on R to the D and and

648
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,720
the projection of F lives on V. Now, how

649
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,919
does the for a transform work? Um, so

650
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,919
here's for a space.

651
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,159
So, for a space is also R R to the T. So

652
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,440
f hat will live on r to the d

653
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,159
and um the forier transform of something

654
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,279
on v

655
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,640
lives on on v as well. So in this r to

656
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,919
the d I'll draw here I'll call it v hat.

657
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,559
Guess if we wanted to we could call this

658
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,559
r to the d hat.

659
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:52,240
Okay. So if I have this function RD to

660
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,799
C, then F hat is a function R to the D

661
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,600
hat goes to C.

662
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:02,080
The projection of F is a function from V

663
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:06,360
to C. And the projection of F hat is a

664
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,360
function from V hat to C.

665
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,679
And then the lema about how they are

666
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,280
related is that if you take the

667
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,079
projection

668
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,960
for a transform of XC,

669
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:25,480
it's just fhat xc

670
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,480
for any c and v.

671
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:52,919
Okay. So, let me write down the sketch

672
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,919
the proof of this lema. Um,

673
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:03,839
it has a simple explanation. Um

674
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:12,599
so pi vf hat of c is the integral over v

675
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:12,599
pi vf of y e the minus i c doy d y.

676
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,599
Now what is pi v of f? Well it's the

677
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:25,599
integral over the fiber. So integral

678
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:30,480
over v integral over pi inverse of y

679
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:36,760
f ofx d of the fiber

680
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,760
e the minus i c do y d y.

681
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,760
Okay. And now notice that we have a

682
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,520
double integral. We're integrating over

683
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,640
the fiber and over y. So if you put

684
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,640
those together, you just get a dx.

685
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,000
Um now what happens to this e to the

686
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,640
minus i c doy?

687
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:05,040
Um so remark

688
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:06,960
that since um x is in pi v inverse

689
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,160
of y

690
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,280
that tells us that x minus y is

691
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,440
perpendicular to v

692
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,400
inverse

693
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,400
>> goes on the pi. Thanks.

694
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,920
So,

695
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:35,119
so over here is Y. Here's the fiber and

696
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,760
in our fiber we have X. So X minus Y is

697
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,640
perpendicular to V.

698
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,720
On the other hand,

699
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:49,920
we also know that the frequency C is in

700
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:54,800
V. C is in this copy of V over here.

701
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:58,000
So x - y is perpendicular to c.

702
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:03,640
x - y x

703
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,640
- y doc is zero.

704
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,240
Okay. So that means I can change this c

705
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,480
doy for x dox and I put these volume

706
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:22,520
forms together. I have the integral of f

707
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:22,520
ofx e minus i c dox dx which is f of c.

708
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Okay.

709
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,760
Okay. Cool. So that's an interesting

710
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,320
connection between projections and for

711
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,000
analysis and it was used classically to

712
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,079
solve the problem of recovering a

713
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,520
density from the cat scan. So

714
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,400
mathematically the problem would be

715
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,119
you're given pi v of f for every v and

716
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,960
you want to recover f and the way you

717
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,800
can do it is because of this formula

718
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,640
you can recover if you're given if you

719
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,040
know all the pi v of fs then you can

720
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,160
compute their for transforms. So you can

721
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,760
compute fhat of c for all the c and v

722
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,520
hat but you have all the different v's

723
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,599
so you put it together now you have

724
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,599
computed f hat so you can find f

725
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,000
oh

726
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,320
[Applause]

727
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,960
um cool but this connection with the

728
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,280
forier transform also can be used to

729
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,440
study this continuous projection theory

730
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,079
problem and it's used to prove this

731
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,079
proposition here.

732
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,040
Yeah.

733
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
>> V.

734
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,040
>> Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. So, the

735
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,720
question is uh what's the difference

736
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,640
between V hat and um I'm not sure it was

737
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,440
helpful to put the hats. It might be

738
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,440
clear if we remove the hats. So, here's

739
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,599
another copy of R to the D where the

740
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,839
variable C lives. And here's the same

741
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,160
space V.

742
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,920
And um

743
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,640
maybe it's clear to remove all these

744
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,640
hats.

745
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Yeah.

746
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Okay.

747
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,599
Um, okay.

748
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,440
So, we mentioned before that this

749
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,440
continuous problem has something to do

750
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,520
with what happens when you take balls

751
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,680
and you project the balls instead of

752
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,599
projecting points. And it's a little

753
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,960
tricky to formulate exactly what the

754
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,960
question should be about projecting

755
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,880
balls. I want to take you through the

756
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,160
first steps um and just see why it's a

757
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,720
little bit tricky and what direction

758
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,720
we're going to go in.

759
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,579
[Applause]

760
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,800
Okay, so I have projection theory

761
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,680
for unit balls

762
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,680
maybe first steps or something like

763
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,680
that.

764
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:43,040
All right. So, let's say that X is a set

765
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,440
of disjoint

766
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,440
unit balls

767
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,280
in a big ball of radius R and R2.

768
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,280
Okay. So then um

769
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,119
uh

770
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,960
so we could consider the projection in

771
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,520
different directions and we'll have sets

772
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,480
of unit intervals more or less.

773
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,319
Um and we could ask for like the number

774
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,400
of directions where something or another

775
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,680
happens. Actually, let's step back a

776
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,800
little bit. So, okay, so we have a set

777
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,119
of unit balls. Um in in this context,

778
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,599
I'm going to use the absolute value of x

779
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,720
to denote the area of x or volume in

780
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,960
whatever dimension. And um hopefully

781
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,800
that will be helpful and not confusing

782
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,480
compared with before. If you have a

783
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,920
bunch of unit balls, its area is more or

784
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,760
less the same as the number of unit

785
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
balls.

786
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,680
Okay.

787
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,560
Um, so then if we look at pi v of x,

788
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,839
that would be the length

789
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,400
of p of x.

790
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,000
All right. So now I want to make a a a

791
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,240
question like the summar troder

792
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,680
question. So I could look at the set of

793
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,040
directions where the projection has

794
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,240
length less than s. Maybe

795
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:07,200
um maybe I'll I'll do that.

796
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,800
So x might be set of v

797
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,440
g12

798
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:16,079
so that um

799
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,319
pi v of x has length at most s.

800
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,160
Okay. But it would now be silly to ask

801
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,000
for the number of elements of this

802
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,319
thing. This thing is very likely

803
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,560
infinite if it's not empty. If you make

804
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,720
a tiny perturbation in v, it will have a

805
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,760
tiny effect on pi v of x. Um so there's

806
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,079
a natural sort of discretetization.

807
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,480
So we note

808
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:47,280
that if the angle between vub1 and v2 is

809
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:51,440
less than 1 / r then um pi v1 ofx and pi

810
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:54,000
v2 of x are basically the same as each

811
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,040
other. And so it doesn't make a lot of

812
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,040
sense to count them separately.

813
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,760
Um so um if we want to count something,

814
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:12,480
one trick we could make is we could have

815
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:16,880
this fancy V be uh a um be a set of R uh

816
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,880
V's in grass one two that are evenly

817
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,880
spaced.

818
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,400
So I just I just draw

819
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,560
sorry our different lines through the

820
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,240
origin evenly spaced at an angle about 1

821
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,560
/ r. Okay. And then my new question will

822
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,040
be

823
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,000
um

824
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,560
uh if X is a set

825
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,640
of disjoint

826
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,599
unit balls

827
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:54,599
in the ball of radius R and R2. Um then

828
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,599
estimate.

829
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,280
Yeah. So actually let's let's um change

830
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,880
this definition. We're not going to

831
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,240
count all of the V's, but we're going to

832
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,839
count the ones in this set V.

833
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,240
And that's see like a more fair

834
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,040
comparison to before.

835
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,520
So, we're going to estimate the size of

836
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,520
the S of X

837
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:22,760
in terms of S and the size of X and we

838
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,760
can compare it to the S8.

839
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,160
Okay.

840
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,720
So we could ask is it still always true

841
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,319
that this is bounded by that expression

842
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,319
there? I'll write that down.

843
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,040
Okay.

844
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:05,800
So is it true

845
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:05,800
that es of x is bounded by 1 + s^2x.

846
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,280
Okay. And this is not true. There's a

847
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,920
configuration of unit balls where e s of

848
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,359
x is much bigger than this.

849
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,119
Um what can we do with unit balls that

850
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,760
sort of wasn't relevant before when we

851
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,760
had perfect points?

852
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,680
What other example might we look at?

853
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,480
>> Um, yeah. What do you think?

854
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,319
>> Integrate functions over them.

855
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,839
>> We could. Yeah, we So, we can integrate

856
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,839
functions over them. Um,

857
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,480
>> yeah. Okay. So, here's a configuration

858
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,920
of unit balls that kind of doesn't have

859
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,520
an analog when you're just looking at

860
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,040
points. But what we're going to do is

861
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,599
we're just going to pack them into a

862
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,800
larger ball. So here's the example.

863
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,520
So here's our big ball

864
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,040
and then inside of it I have a smaller

865
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,440
ball and I pack the smaller ball full of

866
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,440
unit balls.

867
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,440
So add x.

868
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,319
All right. So the area of X or the

869
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,800
number of unit balls is around n^2.

870
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,520
And no matter what direction I project

871
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,560
this thing in,

872
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,280
it's going to kind of fill in an

873
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,280
interval of length n

874
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,000
about n.

875
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:43,599
So for every v, I'm going to have pi v

876
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,599
of x around n, which is x to the 12.

877
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,599
Right?

878
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:59,599
So if I make s equal to uh x to the 12

879
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:03,520
or a bit less um then e s of x is the

880
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,920
whole thing every direction.

881
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,240
And so

882
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,839
the size of es of x is r. It's all of

883
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,960
them. It's as big as it could possibly

884
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,800
be. Whereas if you plug in S is the

885
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,040
square root of X here, you would get

886
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,480
one. So it's sort of actually sort of as

887
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,400
bad as possible. The prediction of some

888
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,800
readyated trottery is one. And the truth

889
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,800
is everything.

890
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,599
Okay. Um

891
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,000
right.

892
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,319
Okay. So these small balls are not

893
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,920
really behaving like points uh because

894
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,040
of the fact that they've been packed so

895
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:49,440
densely into a big ball.

896
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,280
And um so if we if we so okay it is

897
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,960
perfectly reasonable to analyze this

898
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,800
situation and answer this question. We

899
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,359
will do that in this class. There is an

900
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,079
answer to it and it's worth knowing. Um

901
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,319
however as you insist that these small

902
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,720
balls are spread apart apart farther and

903
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,720
farther then they start to behave more

904
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,720
and more like ideal points and

905
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:16,280
eventually this is true.

906
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,280
Um, so a a goal of this part

907
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,640
is to add hypothesis

908
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,839
that the set of balls is spread out

909
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,520
and then get stronger conclusions.

910
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,079
And probably next class we will play

911
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,319
around with how to state some precise

912
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,440
hypotheses and what kind of conclusions

913
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:52,240
we might expect.

914
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,440
Um but the big the big progress that I

915
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,920
referred to at the beginning of the

916
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,800
class in the field is that in the in the

917
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,640
last couple years people proved um let's

918
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,440
say the main conjecture about this

919
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,960
question for unit balls in R2. Um, and

920
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,200
we'll try to flesh it out because you

921
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,760
could imagine many different hypotheses,

922
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,480
but I think the theory gives a fairly

923
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,720
complete picture of how this works for

924
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,319
balls in R2.

925
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,559
Different hypotheses about how spread

926
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,119
out they are and what you can conclude

927
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:27,400
about how often the projections uh have

928
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,400
things piled on top of each other.

929
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,160
Okay,

930
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,160
cool. Um,

931
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,599
okay. Now, there are there are many

932
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,200
variations on these on these questions.

933
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,800
And because this one is a little bit

934
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,800
difficult to state, I thought I'd

935
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,480
mention one other which is a beautiful

936
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,839
open problem and it's pretty clean to

937
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,720
state. Um, and well, let me explain one

938
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:59,680
of the key difficulties.

939
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:02,160
Um, okay. So, so these questions make

940
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,839
sense over any field. I started with the

941
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
real numbers because I was kind of used

942
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,880
to it because I'm an analyst. Uh, but

943
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,119
you could ask about about any field, any

944
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,160
vector space. Um, and actually a very

945
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,160
interesting case is finite fields.

946
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:23,469
[Applause]

947
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,040
Okay. So, cousin problems.

948
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,880
[Applause]

949
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,079
All right. So, let's say FQ is the

950
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:51,720
finite field

951
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,720
with Q elements.

952
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,440
Okay. And if I write FP

953
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,040
that will mean P is a prime. So it's FP

954
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,280
of a field with a prime number of

955
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,640
elements. And FQ is a general finite

956
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,440
field. Q will be some prime val.

957
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,160
Okay. Um

958
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,599
so here's our question. Oh, okay. So now

959
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,240
I should say what is an orthogonal

960
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,640
projection? Um so it's not hard to say

961
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,400
what a subspace is over finite fields.

962
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,839
We don't have obviously a notion of

963
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,760
orthogonality. Um, but orthogonality

964
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,599
isn't really

965
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,200
isn't really the crucial thing. The

966
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:32,079
crucial thing is just that we have a lot

967
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,400
of linear maps from our vector space to

968
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,599
a lower dimensional vector space. We're

969
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,079
really looking at all the possible

970
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,640
linear maps. So in terms of what are the

971
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,200
possible projections, I can um

972
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,280
parameterize them just like this. So if

973
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:51,040
t is in fq,

974
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:58,559
pi t would be a map from fq ^2 to fq.

975
00:51:51,040 --> 00:52:00,079
and pi t of x1 x2 is just x1 + t * x2.

976
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,079
Okay, so those are a bunch of linear

977
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,079
maps.

978
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,720
Okay, and you know, actually you might

979
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,680
say, why don't I write all the linear

980
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,880
maps? I could have t1 x1 plus t2x2.

981
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,920
Those are all the linear maps. Um but if

982
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,040
you multiply t1 and t2 by the same

983
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,040
factor then you've just uh taken a

984
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,920
linear map and then composed with a

985
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,280
linear map from fp to itself. So those

986
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,240
are all going to be sort of equivalent

987
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,920
for us. And so that's why we just we

988
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,920
just set this to be one and let this be

989
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,440
t.

990
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,520
Okay.

991
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,200
So now let's say x is in fq ^2

992
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:43,760
and

993
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:48,400
e s of x is the set of t. So the t just

994
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:52,720
live in fq with the property that pi t

995
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:56,079
of x is at most s.

996
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,800
And now we can ask the same question.

997
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,680
Um

998
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,599
question

999
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,960
estimate

1000
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:10,920
the size of ES of X

1001
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,920
um in terms of

1002
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:18,839
uh S and X

1003
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,839
ideally and I guess maybe Q.

1004
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,319
All right. Now, an integer grid still

1005
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:33,040
makes sense over a finite field. Um, and

1006
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:36,559
um, and so and it works the same way as

1007
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:39,040
in summary and troder and over the prime

1008
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:43,520
fields. That's the best example that we

1009
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:47,920
know. So there is a conjecture

1010
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,760
if x is in fp^2 and p is always prime

1011
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:54,319
but it's important here. So I will sort

1012
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:59,040
of add it. Um then

1013
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:02,040
the size of es of x is bounded by 1 +

1014
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,040
s^2x.

1015
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,240
Okay

1016
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,160
matching that.

1017
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,960
But

1018
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,960
this is not true

1019
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,520
uh in fq ^2.

1020
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,440
Q is not prime.

1021
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,850
Okay.

1022
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,200
So let me show you an example.

1023
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:41,839
[Applause]

1024
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,000
And this example uh plays a big role in

1025
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,000
the theory.

1026
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,680
Um

1027
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:04,319
okay so here's the example.

1028
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,079
Suppose that q is p ^2. There are

1029
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:09,040
similar examples for higher powers but

1030
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:14,400
this is a simple concrete.

1031
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:16,480
Um so FP is a subset of FQ. It's a sub

1032
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,960
field of FQ

1033
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:24,720
and our set X is going to be FP squ

1034
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:30,520
which is a subset of FQ^2.

1035
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,520
Cardality of X is P ^2 which is Q.

1036
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:39,280
Okay. So now notice

1037
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:45,520
that if t is also in fp

1038
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:49,040
and x is an x then pi t of x which is x1

1039
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,920
+ t * x2. Well all of these characters

1040
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,280
I've assumed to be an fp and fp is a

1041
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,200
field so it's closed under addition

1042
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,359
closed under multiplication. So this is

1043
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,359
an FP.

1044
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:10,799
So that tells me that if T is in FP,

1045
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:13,200
pi T of X is is FP is contained in FP.

1046
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,160
It's actually all of it. And so the size

1047
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,680
of pi T of X

1048
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,200
is at most P which is Q to the half

1049
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,200
which is much smaller than the size of

1050
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,200
X.

1051
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:41,040
Okay. So we conclude that the size of

1052
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:47,200
uh e p of x is at least p. So there are

1053
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:49,440
p traces t that all lie in ep of x

1054
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,200
and that's uh that's much bigger than

1055
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,839
the bound in the conjecture for what

1056
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,839
should happen over primes.

1057
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,559
Yeah. So if we were to plug in these

1058
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:04,079
numbers up here, S would be P which is

1059
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:06,799
the square root of Q and X would be Q.

1060
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,400
So this would be one.

1061
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,400
Over prime fields, this should be order

1062
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,880
of one. But over this not prime field,

1063
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,880
it's much bigger.

1064
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,480
Okay.

1065
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,960
Um

1066
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,160
so this shows that projection theory is

1067
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,799
also connected to some I don't know

1068
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:33,559
algebra algebraic structure questions of

1069
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:33,559
of whether fields have sub fields

1070
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:40,640
um and this issue which is uh okay so so

1071
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:44,720
this is an open conjecture and it's hard

1072
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,319
for two reasons um the first reason is

1073
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,319
well you look at it you say okay it's

1074
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,920
like some trotder but over a prime

1075
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:52,559
field. So I should try to take the proof

1076
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,960
of try and that proof completely breaks

1077
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,200
down. Um that proof was based on the

1078
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,359
topology of R. We'll go through it but

1079
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,480
the topology of R and the topology of FP

1080
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,160
are very different and it just doesn't

1081
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,079
work at all. The second reason is that

1082
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,559
uh the statement of the conjecture

1083
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,480
really requires this to be prime. And so

1084
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,559
it's not true for any field. It's only

1085
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,079
true for prime fields. And so you have

1086
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:18,559
to wonder how are we going to use that

1087
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:20,240
in the proof. Um and a lot of methods

1088
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,920
uh a lot of methods have don't

1089
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,200
distinguish between prime fields and not

1090
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,079
prime fields and therefore they can't

1091
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,680
prove the whole thing.

1092
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:32,319
Okay. And in in in the real analysis

1093
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:35,440
setting actually there's the same issue.

1094
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,240
So these um theorems that I wasn't able

1095
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,799
to state precisely for you today

1096
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,640
they are true over R2 but they are false

1097
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,480
in C2

1098
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,799
because the complex numbers have a sub

1099
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,680
field R.

1100
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:54,079
So um so the complex numbers play the

1101
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:56,079
role of like FQ where Q is P ^2

1102
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,000
and so over here also we need to do

1103
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,960
something to distinguish between the

1104
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:06,040
complex numbers and the real numbers. um

1105
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,040
and many many techniques don't do that.

1106
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,119
So a bit surprisingly these these real

1107
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:16,400
analysis problems that eventually get

1108
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:18,319
used in in um uh in like estimates and

1109
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,720
for a analysis with integral operators

1110
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:22,640
that really look like analysis. They

1111
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,280
take something from these questions over

1112
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,200
finite fields. These are these are more

1113
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,559
closely related to each other than

1114
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,520
either one of them is to that first

1115
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,520
semired trotder theorem.

1116
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,680
All right. So at the beginning of the

1117
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,359
class I will teach you some classical

1118
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,280
techniques, some double counting

1119
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,680
techniques, some for analysis

1120
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,920
techniques. Hold on a second. Um and

1121
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,000
they prove interesting things and they

1122
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,760
work over here and they work over here

1123
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,880
but they don't distinguish between the

1124
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,160
prime fields and the not prime fields.

1125
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,319
>> Okay. Yeah. Was there a question?

1126
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,960
>> Yeah. Does the fact that the wheels have

1127
00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:01,880
the rationals as a sub field matter for

1128
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,880
this or does the topology argument?

1129
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:08,720
>> Ah okay. So the question is so the

1130
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:10,720
observation is I said that the situation

1131
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,680
for f

1132
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:17,359
q when q is p ^2 is kind of complicated

1133
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,559
because fq has a sub field namely fp

1134
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,760
and then I tried to say there's

1135
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,520
something similar going on with the

1136
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,119
complex numbers and the real numbers.

1137
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,920
Okay. Now the observation is the real

1138
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,359
numbers have many proper sub fields. One

1139
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,920
of them is the rational numbers. You

1140
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,440
could there are many more number fields.

1141
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,240
Um

1142
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,839
and doesn't doesn't that matter? Yeah,

1143
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,880
that's a good thing for us to reflect

1144
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:40,799
on. It turns out not to matter that much

1145
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,559
and it's because those sub fields are so

1146
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:46,480
small. Um the the real numbers are an

1147
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,480
infinite order extension of the rational

1148
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,799
numbers. I think even an uncountable

1149
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,000
order extension of the rational numbers.

1150
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,920
Um whereas FQ is a degree two extension

1151
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,720
at FP.

1152
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,040
Um

1153
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,240
right so one way people talk about it is

1154
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:08,240
in in terms of housed dorf dimension.

1155
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,160
So the the real numbers have sub fields

1156
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,319
but their house dwarf dimension is

1157
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,319
either zero

1158
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,040
or one if it's if it's the whole real

1159
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:20,400
numbers and not in the middle. Anyway,

1160
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,799
we'll we'll have a look at it.

1161
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,079
Yeah.

1162
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,920
>> Do you have any intuition about why

1163
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,400
these types of things are for small

1164
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,240
fields?

1165
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,839
>> Uh why why you can't do something with

1166
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,839
small bad with small fields

1167
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,400
>> or yeah if I understand the intuition

1168
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:36,559
correctly like the real numbers are fine

1169
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,880
because they're large enough extension

1170
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,480
over the rationals but so I don't know

1171
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,200
I'm just wondering if you have about the

1172
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:47,240
size of this.

1173
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,240
>> Correct. Right.

1174
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,040
Yeah. Okay. So, here's an analogy for

1175
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:59,839
you. Uh, so what if we didn't have P^

1176
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:03,040
squ? What if we had P to the 17th?

1177
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:06,640
Okay. Now, at FQ still has a sub field

1178
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,799
FP, but it's kind of a small sub field.

1179
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,520
We could do this same computation. We

1180
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:16,079
would see that this doesn't fully hold.

1181
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,680
Um but for sets that are pretty large,

1182
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,319
for sets that are a lot larger than

1183
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,960
that, um we would still we might still

1184
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,880
hope for pretty good bounds. And I think

1185
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:29,960
that I think that the situation for the

1186
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,960
small subfields of R is similar to that.

1187
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,960
>> So is this conjunction known for any

1188
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:37,680
prime number or is it every prime

1189
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:41,799
number? See, so I want to prove this

1190
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,799
conjunction for okay.

1191
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,400
>> Um, right. Right. So,

1192
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,400
[Applause]

1193
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,920
okay. So, we stick this tilda here,

1194
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,200
which means there's a missing constant

1195
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,960
factor.

1196
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,720
>> We do that to be safe. I guess it

1197
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,280
probably is true with a small constant

1198
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:04,000
factor, but strictly speaking, you can't

1199
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,520
falsify it with one prime number. Okay.

1200
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,520
But that that's not the that's not the

1201
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,200
real reason. Then you might say, you

1202
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,520
know, if you take a medium prime number

1203
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,200
like 101, could you check it

1204
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,920
numerically?

1205
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,680
Maybe for 10. Well, even for 101, you

1206
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,839
know, I don't have any wisdom about how

1207
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,280
to do this. And if you literally did it

1208
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:25,200
by brute force um and checked all the

1209
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,960
possibilities X, you really couldn't go

1210
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,160
very far.

1211
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,839
Um and um I'm not sure if we'll address

1212
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,240
this but that there is a computational

1213
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,839
question like you know maybe I can't

1214
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,920
prove this conjecture but do I

1215
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:40,720
understand it well enough that I could

1216
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,880
prove it for a particular P faster than

1217
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:46,400
brute force

1218
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:51,559
um I don't and so we're not able to have

1219
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,559
much numerical evidence. Yeah.

1220
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Yeah,

1221
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,760
it could be worth looking for counter

1222
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,119
example on the computer. The evidence is

1223
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,079
not that strong in favor of this

1224
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,240
conjecture.

1225
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,240
Okay, cool.

1226
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,079
Okay, in the last 15 minutes, I wanted

1227
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,039
to mention to you some other parts of

1228
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:17,359
math that this connects to.

1229
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:21,440
Um

1230
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:23,039
uh okay. Um so one connection is to a

1231
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,599
part of combinatorial number theory

1232
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,680
called sum product theory which we'll

1233
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,039
see sort of fits in naturally with this

1234
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,119
issue. Um

1235
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,119
yeah so it turn so in this in this

1236
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,400
example this set that we're worried

1237
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:42,400
about is closely connected to the fact

1238
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,160
that that fq has a interesting sub field

1239
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,319
interesting subset that's closed under

1240
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,720
addition and multiplication

1241
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:50,480
and the field the the the sum product

1242
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,240
theory and combinatorial number theory

1243
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,400
is about what happens to a set under

1244
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,200
addition and multiplication

1245
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,480
um so initially it's over r over the

1246
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,480
reals but then we can ask

1247
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:33,359
Okay. So let's say that R is a ring. So

1248
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:38,160
we can define sums and products. And A

1249
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:40,000
is a subset of R. So A plus A is all of

1250
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,920
the sums you can make. Two elements of

1251
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,359
A. So it's the set of all the A1 plus A2

1252
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,240
where A1 and A2 are in A. And the

1253
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:53,960
product set A times A is similar. It's

1254
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,960
the set of all the products.

1255
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,400
All

1256
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,720
right. Um, okay. So, actually motivating

1257
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:06,079
this from before, what what was so bad

1258
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:10,240
about this set FP as a subset of FQ? The

1259
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:13,839
problem was just that um well,

1260
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:17,839
if if these three guys are in FP, then

1261
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:19,599
X1 plus T * X2 is still in FP. So, the

1262
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,599
problem was that FP is closed under sums

1263
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,280
and under products.

1264
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,280
Um

1265
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,520
so it raises the question are there

1266
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,680
other sets that are maybe not exactly

1267
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,640
closed but roughly closed under sums and

1268
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,720
products.

1269
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,520
Um

1270
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:41,359
okay so so the idea of some product

1271
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:43,599
theory is take a subset A and R.

1272
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:48,680
Um could it happen that both A plus A

1273
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,680
and A * A are pretty small?

1274
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:56,640
Um okay so let me mention a few

1275
01:06:52,799 --> 01:07:00,319
examples. So if a is a subset of the

1276
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:05,119
real numbers which is generic

1277
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:08,160
then a + a and a * a would both be

1278
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,760
around the size of a squ generically

1279
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,200
there would be no coincidences in the

1280
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,920
sums or in the brackets. Um okay but it

1281
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:20,000
could happen that a plus a is quite is

1282
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:24,280
not very big. Um so if a

1283
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,280
is an arithmetic progression

1284
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,640
then the size of a plus a is only around

1285
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:36,640
two times the size of a

1286
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,160
but in this case a time a would be very

1287
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,200
big.

1288
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:44,200
Um on the other hand if a is a geometric

1289
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,200
progression

1290
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:50,240
then the size of a time a would be

1291
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,319
around two times the size of a but if a

1292
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,559
is a geometric progression then a plus a

1293
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:58,000
would be very big.

1294
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:00,160
Okay so based on these few examples um

1295
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,720
and saretti conjectured that always one

1296
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:05,200
of these guys is big. So here's their

1297
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:09,920
conjecture. Uh as is still an open

1298
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:12,960
problem. Um if a is a finite subset of

1299
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,680
the wheels,

1300
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:20,319
then the maximum

1301
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:25,040
of a + a and a * a

1302
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:26,719
is at least c epsilon a 2us epsilon. So

1303
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,199
for every so at the beginning I should

1304
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,440
put for every epsilon bigger than zero.

1305
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:33,279
Okay. So it's not quite a squ. That

1306
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,480
example comes from taking the numbers 1

1307
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:40,560
to n. Then a plus a is clearly quite

1308
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:43,839
small. A * a is many of the integers

1309
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,839
from 1 to n^ squ. Uh but not all of

1310
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,279
them. Some of them have a prime factor

1311
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:50,560
that's bigger than n. So they're not in

1312
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:54,560
the list. And computed that carefully.

1313
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,719
So he said you need the epsilon.

1314
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,480
Okay.

1315
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,600
Um

1316
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,440
so So this type of problem is connected

1317
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,400
to progress to projection theory because

1318
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:09,199
of this type of example.

1319
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,199
Um and the connection goes in both

1320
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:12,199
directions.

1321
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,960
Um

1322
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:27,960
so in one direction

1323
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,400
uh there's a okay there's a theorem of

1324
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:37,759
alakish about the sum product theorem um

1325
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:39,600
so we can't prove this but um any

1326
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,759
exponent here that's bigger than one

1327
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,839
would be non-trivial and we can prove it

1328
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,440
with exponents that are bigger than one

1329
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:49,679
and um historically there was a big jump

1330
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,319
in the quality of the exponent when all

1331
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,319
proved this theorem

1332
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:57,600
So he proved

1333
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:02,640
a is a subset of r which is finite

1334
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:05,920
then the maximum of a + a and a * a is

1335
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,719
at least a to the five quarters.

1336
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:12,679
Um and the key ingredient in the proof

1337
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,679
was some ready trial.

1338
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:19,199
Uh that's not the whole proof but the

1339
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,760
the uh proof uses some ready trial and

1340
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,880
and not much else. it's quite short and

1341
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,320
so if you know something about

1342
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,960
projection theory you can say something

1343
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,960
about some product

1344
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,360
um but later things went in the other

1345
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,320
direction

1346
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:38,840
um so there's a theorem

1347
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:38,840
of Borgan cats and toao

1348
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,040
which says that not only a prime field

1349
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,440
does not have any sub fields which we

1350
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:52,960
knew but it doesn't have anything that's

1351
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,480
even close to being a subre.

1352
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,040
So

1353
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:00,560
P is prime

1354
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:05,600
and A is a subset of FP

1355
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:08,239
and um A is not too big.

1356
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,520
So it's not super important what this

1357
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:15,440
number is, but a is significantly

1358
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:22,239
smaller than the whole field. Um then

1359
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:25,600
the maximum of a + a and a * a um is at

1360
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:27,840
least the size of a to the 1 plus

1361
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,320
epsilon where epsilon is a small but

1362
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,560
explicit number I think something like 1

1363
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,560
over 20.

1364
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,120
Um

1365
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,199
this theorem is actually more accessible

1366
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,800
than projection theory in general.

1367
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:46,560
Having these sums and products gives you

1368
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,800
a little bit more structure. Turns out

1369
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:53,040
to be important but it shows that in FP

1370
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,800
over FP there's no example which is too

1371
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,719
much like this example. You can't just

1372
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,719
choose a subset of FP which is almost

1373
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:02,000
closed under sums and products and then

1374
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:06,560
mimic this argument.

1375
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:10,320
Um, and it's not immediate, but this is

1376
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:14,120
used to to improve

1377
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,120
the projection theory

1378
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,239
in FP squared. And something similar

1379
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,800
will also happen for problems about

1380
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:25,800
balls in R2.

1381
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,800
Okay, I wanted to mention some other

1382
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,400
applications, but I don't want to cram

1383
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,480
things in too much in the last five

1384
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,280
minutes. I'll just say a few words and

1385
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:55,360
then I'll pause for final questions. Um

1386
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:58,880
so one one application or story is um

1387
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:01,280
from civ theory in number theory. So in

1388
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,440
civ theory you have a set of integers

1389
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:07,440
instead of a set of points in a vector

1390
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,800
space. And when in civ theory we study

1391
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,440
what happens if you take the set of

1392
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:15,040
integers and you reduce it mod p or mod

1393
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:17,760
q for many different numbers q.

1394
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,920
Um, and there are some questions about

1395
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,159
general sets like could it happen that

1396
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,800
you have a set of integers and whenever

1397
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:27,120
you reduce it mod q for any q you you

1398
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,320
always get something small. What could

1399
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,840
you say about your set of integers?

1400
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,360
So an interesting example of that are

1401
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,880
the square numbers. If you take the

1402
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,719
squares and you reduce it mod p for any

1403
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,800
prime start with primes you get the

1404
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,360
quadratic residues which is only half of

1405
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,040
the residue classes. So whenever you

1406
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,760
reduce it mod p you only get half of the

1407
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,080
residue classes. How many other sets of

1408
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,000
integers can you think of that? Whenever

1409
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,480
you reduce the mod p you only get half

1410
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,640
of the residue classes.

1411
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,640
Um how big could such a set of integers

1412
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,120
be? How you know how what fraction of

1413
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,679
all the integers and so on. So there's

1414
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,960
one one set of questions about this. Um,

1415
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,400
and there's another set of questions

1416
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,760
where you take a particular set of

1417
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,360
integers that you might be interested

1418
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,120
in, of which the most famous is the

1419
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,000
primes, and you think about what happens

1420
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:16,560
when you reduce the set the primes mod q

1421
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,960
for many different q.

1422
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,600
Um, so it appears to be the case that

1423
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:25,360
the prime numbers are evenly distributed

1424
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,040
mod q for every.

1425
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,520
Um, actually depending on how you

1426
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:32,080
quantify it, that's a that's a theorem.

1427
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,480
Um, so if you fix a Q and you take the

1428
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,280
primes mod Q and you take primes up to X

1429
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,199
where X is much much much bigger than Q,

1430
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,360
they will be evenly distributed among

1431
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,960
the residue classes mod Q that are

1432
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,760
possible, the ones that have no common

1433
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,840
factor with Q.

1434
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,840
But you could ask you you might also

1435
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,239
want to know uh if you take the primes

1436
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,440
up to some fixed X and you reduce the

1437
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:56,880
mod q for many different Q. Um, it it

1438
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,920
still appears it appears that those are

1439
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,840
evenly distributed for quite big q.

1440
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,880
even Q Q's that are only slightly less

1441
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:08,000
than than X.

1442
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,440
Um, okay, we can't prove anything like

1443
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,840
that. Um, but there's a line of thought

1444
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,440
that maybe we could relax what we're

1445
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,880
trying to prove a little bit and try

1446
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,960
instead of trying to prove it for every

1447
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,040
Q, we could try to prove it for most of

1448
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,800
the Q.

1449
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,960
And now we're in this setting uh uh

1450
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,040
where we have one fixed set and we're

1451
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,320
looking at how it reduces mod Q for many

1452
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,679
different Q and and that problem is very

1453
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,920
similar to the projection theory

1454
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,760
problem.

1455
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,440
Okay. So anyway, so we'll so we'll teach

1456
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,120
some core techniques of projection

1457
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,199
theory that were developed by people in

1458
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:46,719
geometric measure theory in the 60s7s

1459
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:48,560
and 80s. And those are almost those are

1460
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,560
very closely parallel to the classic

1461
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:55,360
techniques of civ theory that were

1462
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:58,080
developed by people in the 40s 50s 60s.

1463
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,440
Um and so okay so interesting

1464
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,840
connections there and in civ theory

1465
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,360
there are lots of uh lots of open

1466
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,080
problems.

1467
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,080
So that's one set of applications if you

1468
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,800
like or connections.

1469
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,400
Um

1470
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,920
and the other one I wanted to mention is

1471
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,280
to dynamical systems. Um so Elon Alon

1472
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,600
Linden Strauss last year gave the

1473
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,320
Simon's lectures and one of the things

1474
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,800
was about taking orbits in homogeneous

1475
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,480
spaces unipot so I don't have time to

1476
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,800
say what all the things are but you take

1477
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:33,360
unipotent orbits in homogeneous spaces

1478
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:36,960
then they distribute very evenly um and

1479
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:39,840
um so there are some classical important

1480
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,000
theorems about that and the recent thing

1481
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,920
he and Amir Mohammadi were trying to

1482
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,199
make it more quantitative and a new idea

1483
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,560
a in their proof is they brought in

1484
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:50,320
projection theory. Um so so anyway so I

1485
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,239
will tell you the story I'll slowly

1486
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,440
first of all what is the question and

1487
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,760
then what does it have to do with

1488
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,520
projection theory.

1489
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,159
So those are some some applications I

1490
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:04,360
was thinking that it would that I'd like

1491
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:04,360
to to talk about with you.

1492
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:12,440
>> Okay. Um any last questions or comments?

1493
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,440
>> Yeah.

1494
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,520
Right. So the question is the the

1495
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,960
summary trider theorem is usually said

1496
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,640
in a different way actually a more

1497
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,400
general way where you have a set of

1498
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,880
lines and you look at the points that

1499
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,199
have many lines going through them. Um

1500
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,719
and we'll see that this is a corlary or

1501
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,719
special case of that.

1502
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,880
like

1503
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,640
they are quite different.

1504
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,719
If you're just

1505
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,679
>> Yeah, let's talk about that after class.

1506
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,840
>> Yeah.

1507
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:20,440
>> Okay, good. Let's stop there for today.

1508
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,440
Um, and I will see you on Thursday.
