00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,359
so we have to consider the possibility

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,919
that these Snips are not independent

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,400
events I believe a squirrel just ran

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:12,799
into the back of class

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,679
so he's okay he's just enjoying his life

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,920
on the wall could be worse could be a

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,119
different type of

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,020
rodent a poor little guy he wants to

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,519
learn about genetics too who can blame

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,640
him unfortunately this squirrel has

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,840
distracted us from a concept that is a

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,480
frequent confusion for more MIT moments
