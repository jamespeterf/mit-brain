00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,680
Hi. Uh my name is De Patel. I'm the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,880
co-founder and CEO of Blue Shift. Uh

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,960
we're building a mining processing

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,880
company with a mission to accelerate

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,480
economic resilience and enable uh

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,560
resilience of these critical mineral

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,240
supply chains and the scalability of

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,519
them. We are building out of the engine

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,519
and green town. um and my co-founder um

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,840
professor David did his grad study at uh

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,880
MIT.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,399
The problem we are facing is

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,440
u the upheaval of critical mineral

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,120
supply chains. You know we are seeing a

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,360
shift of focus from globalized supply

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,879
chains to more uh resilient and domestic

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,120
supply chains. And we have seen a

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,360
concentration of some of these supply

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,399
chains happen especially for a country

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,000
like the US which currently depends on

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,159
uh currently depends 100% on imports for

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,360
21 of these 50 critical minerals and

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,280
these minerals are used in industries

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,000
that amount around 90 trillion uh

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,640
dollars. Yeah. And uh one of the

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,960
critical ones amongst these are the rare

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
earth elements which are used in

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,600
everything from missile guidance systems

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,960
to uh uh to your smartphones and China

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,759
has recently enacted a ban on these uh

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,119
causing a major supply constraint on

32
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,240
that.

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,799
Um the solution we're working on is

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,119
building a mining processing solution

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,960
that is profitable, autonomous and

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,960
simplified.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,079
We are building something that will

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,399
preserve uh margins at scale being

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,479
highly energy efficient. We're building

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,280
something that is autonomous uh and can

41
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,799
operate modularly leverages IoT and an

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,200
AI layer on top of that. Um and we have

43
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,920
significantly increased the intensity of

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,520
the process. simplified it and hence

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,520
results in something that is low capex.

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,599
So we have a very versatile process that

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,000
turns uh current liabilities into

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,200
products. So we are taking an input such

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,560
as collash malings etc running it

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,160
through our modular process u and

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
extracting minerals such as nickel

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,280
generators through our patented process.

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,640
Uh, one example of a untapped resource

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,040
is the coal flash that currently sits in

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,760
the US which holds around five decades

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,120
worth of uh rare earth elements.

57
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,640
Uh we're looking for partnerships on the

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,480
on the way side. We're looking for

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,640
people in the utility space that own u

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,840
collash liabilities. would like to

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,080
partner with them to uh deploy smallcale

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,720
tests and also enter in long-term

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,400
partnerships. Similarly, in the mine

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,319
waste space, we're looking at people

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
that have boxite residue, aluminina

66
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,680
tailings, etc. um and broader mine

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,360
tailings as well and do similar small

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,440
scale tests with them. on the uh you

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,319
know downstream side, we're interested

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,480
in partnering with people that put these

71
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,959
rare elements in uh magnets and you know

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,080
developing that supply chain alongside

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:40,640
with OEMs uh in the automotive and

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,640
defense space. Thank you.
