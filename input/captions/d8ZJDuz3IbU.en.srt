stoffer in the coming decades renewable

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,080
energy sources such as solar and wind

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,480
will increasingly dominate the

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,359
conventional power grid because those

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,560
sources only generate electricity when

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,400
it's sunny or windy ensuring reliable

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,800
grid one that can deliver power 24/7

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,160
requires some means of storing

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,719
electricity when supplies are abundant

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,440
and delivering it later when they're not

15
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,600
and because there can be hours and even

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,800
days with no wind for example some

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,640
energy storage devices must be able to

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,280
store a large amount of electricity for

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,840
a long time a promising technology for

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,879
performing that task is the flow battery

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,239
an electrochemical device that can store

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,680
hundreds of megawatt hours of energy

23
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,520
enough to keep thousands of homes

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,960
running for many hours on a single

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,480
charge flow batteries have the potential

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,640
for long lifetimes and low costs in part

27
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,400
due to their unusual design and the

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,439
everyday batteries used in phones and

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,320
electric vehicles the materials that

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,640
store the electric charge are solid

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,920
coatings on the electrodes a flow

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,240
battery takes those solid state charge

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,439
storage materials dissolves them in

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,600
electrolyte Solutions and then pumps the

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,000
solutions through the electrodes says

fak brushett an associate professor of

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,640
chemical engineering that design offers

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,200
many benefits and poses a few

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,040
challenges flow batteries design design

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,720
and

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,040
operation a flow battery contains two

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,880
substances that undergo electrochemical

43
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,200
reactions in which electrons are

44
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,960
transferred from one to the other when

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,079
the battery is being charged the

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,600
transfer of electrons forces the two

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,719
substances into a state that's less

48
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,880
energetically favorable as it stores

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,079
extra energy think of a ball being

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
pushed up to the top of a hill when the

51
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,840
battery is being discharged the transfer

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,119
of electrons shifts the substances into

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,439
a more energetically favorable state as

54
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,320
the stored energy is released the ball

55
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,840
is set free and allowed to roll down the

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,759
hill at the core of a flow battery are

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,080
two large tanks that hold liquid

58
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,239
electrolytes one positive and the other

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,879
negative each electrolyte contains

60
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,560
dissolved active species atoms are

61
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,000
molecules that will electrochemically

62
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,720
react to release or store electrons

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,080
during charging one species is oxidized

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,760
releases electrons and the other is

65
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,440
reduced gains electrons during

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
discharging they swap rolls pumps are

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,920
used to circulate the two electrolytes

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,040
through separate electrodes each made of

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,200
a porous material that provides abundant

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,640
surfaces on which the active species can

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,440
react a thin membrane between the

72
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,239
adjacent electrodes keeps the two

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,480
electrolytes from coming into direct

74
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,800
contact and possibly reacting which

75
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,920
would release heat and waste energy that

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,080
could otherwise be used on the grid when

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,480
the battery is being discharged active

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,280
species on the negative side oxidize

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920
releasing electrons that flow through an

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,959
external circuit to the positive side

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,480
side causing the species there to be

82
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,080
reduced the flow of those electrons

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,200
through the external circuit can power

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
the Grid in addition to the movement of

85
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,040
the electrons supporting ions other

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
charged species in the electrolyte pass

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,280
through the membrane to help complete

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
the reaction and keep the system

89
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,480
electrically neutral once all the

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
species have reacted and the battery is

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,920
fully discharged the system can be

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,200
recharged in that process electricity

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,439
from wind turbines solar farms and other

94
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,760
generating sources drives the reverse

95
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,680
reactions the active species on the

96
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,400
positive side oxidize to release

97
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,519
electrons back through the wires to the

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,159
negative side where they rejoin their

99
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,040
original active species the battery is

100
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,200
now reset and ready to send out more

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,280
electricity when it's needed brush it

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,599
adds the battery can be cycled in this

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,799
way over and over again for years on end

104
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,040
benefits and

105
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,120
challenges A major advantage of this

106
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,560
system design is that where the energy

107
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,159
is stored the tanks is separated from

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
where the electrochemical reactions

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,519
occur the so-called reactor which

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,040
includes the porest electrodes and

111
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,239
membrane as a result the capacity of the

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,159
battery how much energy it can store and

113
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,400
its power the rate at which it can be

114
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,439
charged and discharged can be adjusted

115
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,320
separately if I want to have more

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,759
capacity I can just make the tanks

117
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,880
bigger explains Cara rodby PhD 22 a

118
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,919
former member of brushett lab and now a

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
technical Analyst at Volta Energy

120
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,000
Technologies and if I want to increase

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
its power I can increase the size of the

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,280
reactor that flexibility makes it

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,479
possible to design a flow battery to

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,240
suit a particular application and to

125
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,479
modify it if it needs change in the

126
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,120
future however the electrolyte and a

127
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,199
flow battery can degrade with time in

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,360
use while all batteries experience

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,479
electrolyte degradation flow batteries

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,240
in particular suffer from a relatively

131
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,520
faster form of degradation called

132
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,479
crossover the membrane is designed to

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,039
allow small supporting ions to pass

134
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,400
through and block the larger active

135
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,720
species but in reality it isn't

136
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,960
perfectly selective some of the active

137
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,919
species in one tank can sneak through or

138
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,360
cross over and mix with the electrolyte

139
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,560
in the other tank the two active species

140
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,639
may then chemically react effectively

141
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,759
discharging the battery even if they

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,039
don't some of the active species is no

143
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,240
longer in the first tank where it

144
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,720
belongs so the overall capacity of the

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,759
battery is lower recovering capacity

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,919
lost to crossover requires some sort of

147
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,199
remediation for example replacing the

148
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,800
electrolyte in one or both tanks or

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,800
finding a way to reestablish the

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,319
oxidation states of the active species

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,199
in the two tanks

152
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,199
oxidation state is a number assigned to

153
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,160
an atom or compound to tell if it is

154
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,960
more or fewer electrons than it has when

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,960
it's in its neutral State such

156
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,199
remediation is more easily and therefore

157
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,120
more cost effectively executing a flow

158
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,880
battery because all the components are

159
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,280
more easily accessed than they are in a

160
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,800
conventional battery the state-ofthe-art

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,600
vadium a critical factor in designing

162
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,319
flow batteries is the selected chemistry

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,440
the two electrolytes can contain

164
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,360
different chemicals but today the most

165
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,039
widely used setup has been vadium and

166
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,680
different oxidation states on the two

167
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,080
sides that Arrangement addresses the two

168
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,199
major challenges with flow batteries

169
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,440
first vadium doesn't degrade if you put

170
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,000
100 G of vadium into your battery and

171
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,000
you come back in 100 years you should be

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,520
able to recover 100 G of that vadium as

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,360
long as the battery doesn't have some

174
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,680
sort of a physical leak says brushit and

175
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,400
second if some of the vadium in one tank

176
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,840
flows through the membrane to the other

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,919
side there is no permanent

178
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,120
cross-contamination of the electrolytes

179
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,759
only a shift in the oxidation states

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,800
which is easily remediated by

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,880
rebalancing the electrolyte volumes and

182
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,360
restoring the oxidation state via minor

183
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,199
charge step most of today's commercial

184
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,199
systems include a pipe connecting the

185
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,599
two vadium tanks that automatically

186
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,759
transfers a certain amount of

187
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,080
electrolyte from one tank to the other

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,560
when the two get out of balance however

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
as the grid becomes increasingly

190
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,720
dominated by Renewables more and more

191
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,360
flow batteries will be needed to provide

192
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,440
long duration storage demand for vadium

193
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,440
will grow and that will be a problem

194
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,879
vadium is found around the world but in

195
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,440
dilute amounts and extracting it as

196
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,840
difficult says rodby so there are

197
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,879
limited places mostly in Russia China

198
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,319
and South Africa where it's produced and

199
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,319
the supply chain isn't reliable as a

200
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,680
result vadium prices are both high and

201
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,879
extremely volatile an impediment to the

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
broad deployment of the vadium flow

203
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,759
battery beyond

204
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,720
vadium the question then becomes if not

205
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,840
vadium then what researchers worldwide

206
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,400
are trying to answer that question and

207
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,039
many are focusing on promising

208
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,000
chemistries using materials that are

209
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,199
more abundant and less expensive than

210
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,919
vadium but it's not that easy notes

211
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,319
rodby while other chemistries may offer

212
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,639
lower initial Capital costs they may be

213
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
more expensive to operate over time they

214
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
may require periotic servicing to

215
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,800
rejuvenate one or both of their

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
electrolytes you may even need to

217
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,479
replace them so you're essentially

218
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,080
incurring that initial low Capital cost

219
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,560
again and again says rodby indeed

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,520
comparing the economics of different

221
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,159
options is difficult because there are

222
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,440
so many dependent variables says brush

223
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,960
it a flow battery is an electrochemical

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,879
system which means that there are

225
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,919
multiple components working together in

226
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,759
order for the device to function because

227
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,479
of that if you are trying to improve a

228
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,039
system performance cost whatever it's

229
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:17,639
very difficult because when you touch

230
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
one thing five other things change so

231
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,159
how can we compare these new and

232
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,680
emerging chemistries in a meaningful way

233
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,639
with today's vadium systems and how do

234
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,639
we compare them with one another so we

235
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,120
know which ones are more promising and

236
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,240
what the potential pitfalls are with

237
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,879
each one

238
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,760
addressing those questions can help us

239
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,080
decide where to focus our research and

240
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
where to invest our research and

241
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,880
development dollars now says Bret

242
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,800
technoeconomic modeling as a guide a

243
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,120
good way to understand and assess the

244
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,080
economic viability of new and emerging

245
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
Energy Technologies is using

246
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,440
technoeconomic modeling with certain

247
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,800
models one can account for the capital

248
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,959
cost of a defined system and based on

249
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,399
the system's projected performance the

250
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,279
operating costs over time generating a

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
total cost discount counted over the

252
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,040
system's lifetime that result allows a

253
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,760
potential purchaser to compare options

254
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,560
on a levelized cost of storage basis

255
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,360
using that approach rodby developed a

256
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,600
framework for estimating the levelized

257
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,640
cost for flow batteries the framework

258
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,560
includes a dynamic physical model of the

259
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,800
battery that tracks its performance over

260
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,360
time including any changes in storage

261
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,240
capacity the calculated operating costs

262
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,480
therefore cover all services required

263
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,440
over Decades of operation including the

264
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,760
remediation steps taken in response to

265
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,680
species degradation and crossover

266
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,760
analyzing all possible chemistries would

267
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,200
be impossible so the researchers focused

268
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,000
on certain classes first they narrowed

269
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
the options down to those in which the

270
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,160
active species are dissolved in water

271
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,519
aquous systems are furthest along and

272
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,040
are most likely to be successful

273
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,600
commercially sus brby next they limited

274
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,120
their analyses to asymmetric chemistries

275
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,480
that is setups that use different

276
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,880
materials in the two tanks as brush it

277
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,720
explains vadium is unusual in that using

278
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,399
the same parent material in both tanks

279
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,560
is rarely feasible finally they divided

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,760
the possibilities into two classes

281
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,000
species that have a finite Lifetime and

282
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,200
species that have an infinite lifetime

283
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,240
that is ones that degrade over time and

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,800
ones that don't results from their

285
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,079
analyses aren't clear-cut there isn't a

286
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
particular chemistry that leads pack but

287
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,079
they do provide General guidelines for

288
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,760
choosing and pursuing the different

289
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,279
options finite lifetime materials while

290
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,399
vadium is a single element the finite

291
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,440
lifetime materials are typically organic

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,600
molecules made up of multiple elements

293
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,399
among them carbon one advantage of

294
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,240
organic molecules is that they can be

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,200
synthesized in a lab and at an

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,720
industrial scale and the structure can

297
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,560
be altered to suit a specific function

298
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,760
for example the molecule can be made

299
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,519
more soluble so more will be present in

300
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,480
the electrolyte and the energy density

301
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,000
of the system will be greater or it

302
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,360
could be made bigger so it won't fit

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,040
through the membrane and cross to the

304
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,040
other side finally organic molecules can

305
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,160
be made from simple abundant lowcost

306
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,880
elements potentially even waste streams

307
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,480
from other Industries

308
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,480
despite those attractive features there

309
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,920
are two concerns first organic molecules

310
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,160
would probably need to be made in a

311
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,320
chemical plant and upgrading the lowc

312
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,839
cost precursors as needed may prove to

313
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
be more expensive than desired second

314
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,040
these molecules are large chemical

315
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,800
structures that aren't always very

316
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,959
stable so they're prone to degradation

317
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,760
so along with crossover you now have a

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,120
new degradation mechanism that occurs

319
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,760
over time says rodby moreover you may

320
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,519
figure out the degradation process and

321
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,800
how to reverse in one type of organic

322
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,360
molecule but the process may be totally

323
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,360
different in the next molecule you work

324
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,000
on making the discovery and development

325
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,560
of each new chemistry require

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,560
significant effort research is ongoing

327
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,959
but at present rodby and brushit find it

328
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,240
challenging to make the case for the

329
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,399
finite lifetime chemistries mostly based

330
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,880
on their Capital costs citing studies

331
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
that have estimated the manufacturing

332
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,720
cost of these materials broadby believes

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
the current options cannot be made at

334
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,720
low enough cost to be economically

335
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,000
viable they're cheaper than vadium but

336
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,360
not cheap enough says rodby the results

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,079
send an important message to to

338
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,480
researchers designing new chemistries

339
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,760
using organic molecules be sure to

340
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,600
consider operating challenges early on

341
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
rodby and brush it note that it's often

342
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,040
not until way down the Innovation

343
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,839
pipeline that researchers start to

344
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,800
address practical questions concerning

345
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,240
the long-term operation of a promising

346
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,000
looking system the MIT team recommends

347
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,920
that understanding the potential Decay

348
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,720
mechanisms and how they might be coste

349
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,959
effectively reversed or remediated

350
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,480
should be an upfront design

351
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,720
Criterion infinite lifetime species the

352
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,320
infinite life species include materials

353
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,760
that like vadium are not going to Decay

354
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,240
the most likely candidates are other

355
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,959
metals for example iron or manganese

356
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,560
these are commodity scale chemicals that

357
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,880
will certainly be low cost as rodby here

358
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,000
the researchers found that there's a

359
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
wider design space of feasible options

360
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that could compete with vadium but there

361
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,760
are still challenges to be addressed

362
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,480
while these species don't degrade they

363
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,000
may trigger side reactions when used in

364
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,279
a battery for example many metals

365
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,519
catalyze the formation of hydrogen which

366
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,639
reduces efficiency and adds another form

367
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,720
of capacity loss while there are ways to

368
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,639
deal with the hydrogen Evolution problem

369
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,480
a sufficiently low cost and effective

370
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,680
solution for high rates of the side

371
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,440
reaction is still needed in addition

372
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,639
crossover is still a problem requiring

373
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,399
remediation steps the researchers

374
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,160
evaluated two methods of dealing with

375
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,839
crossover and systems combining two

376
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,560
types of infinite lifetime species the

377
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,360
first is The Spectator strategy here

378
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,000
both of the tanks contain both active

379
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,680
species explains brushit you have the

380
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,760
same electrolyte mixture on both sides

381
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,560
of the battery

382
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,120
but only one of the species is ever

383
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,560
working and the other is a spectator as

384
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,519
a result crossover can be remediated in

385
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,880
similar ways to those used the vadium

386
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,680
flow battery the drawback is that half

387
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,760
of the active material in each tank is

388
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,839
unavailable for storing charge so it's

389
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,000
wasted you've essentially doubled your

390
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,600
electrolyte cost on a per unit energy

391
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,399
basis says rodby the second method calls

392
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,759
for making a membrane that is perfectly

393
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,480
selective it must let through only the

394
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,040
supporting ion needed to maintain the

395
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,880
electrical balance between the two sides

396
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,680
however that approach increases cell

397
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,320
resistance hurting system efficiency in

398
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,800
addition the membrane would need to be

399
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,440
made of a special material say a ceramic

400
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,120
composite that would be extremely

401
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,480
expensive based on current production

402
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,600
methods and scales rodby notes that work

403
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
on such membranes is underway but the

404
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,040
cost and performance metrics are far off

405
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,680
from where they need to be to make sense

406
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,399
time is of the essence the researcher

407
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,079
stress the urgency of the climate change

408
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,639
threat and the need to have grids scale

409
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,680
long duration storage systems at the

410
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,800
ready there are many chemistries now

411
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,720
being looked at says broadb but we need

412
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,600
to hone in on some solutions that will

413
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,519
actually be able to compete with vadium

414
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,880
and can be deployed soon and operated

415
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,800
over the long term the technoeconomic

416
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,120
framework is intended to help guide that

417
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,480
process it can calculate the levelized

418
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,639
cost of storage for specific designs for

419
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,839
comparison with vadium systems and with

420
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,600
one another it can identify critical

421
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,839
gaps in knowledge related to long-term

422
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,800
operation or remediation thereby

423
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,600
identifying technology development or

424
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,079
experimental investigation that should

425
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
be prioritized and it can help determine

426
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,600
whether the trade-off between lower

427
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,160
upfront costs and greater operating

428
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,399
costs makes sense in these Next

429
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Generation chemistries the good news

430
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,560
notes broadby is that advances achieved

431
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,079
in research on one type of flow battery

432
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,480
chemistry can often be applied to others

433
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,160
a lot of the principles learned with

434
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,199
vadium can be translated to other

435
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,920
systems she says she believes that the

436
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,920
field is Advanced not only in

437
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,120
understanding but also in the ability to

438
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,759
design experiments that address problems

439
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,560
common to all flow batteries thereby

440
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,399
helping to prepare the technology for

441
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,360
its important role of grid scill storage

442
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,560
