1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,840
we're going to talk about demand

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,839
planning and demand is really the

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,359
Catalyst for the whole supply chain and

4
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,480
we're going to illustrate this using an

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,160
actual

6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,000
chain so Chelsea's demand Tim is Supply

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,439
and in a sudden onsite crisis demand may

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,760
be really high Supply can't keep up so

9
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,439
Tim in the supply role learns from that

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,400
and is going to be ready to push a lot

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,039
faster so the next Crisis hits he's

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,560
pushing hard but demand isn't as high CU

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,560
we didn't assess it effectively and the

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,439
inventory is piling up in front of

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,239
now there could be more than one actor

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,480
in the supply chain so I'm going to step

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,520
here and play the role of distribution

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,600
jealousy starts pulling I don't have

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,640
enough capacity so but the but the

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,520
inventory is still piling up now the

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,199
problem is I didn't pay attention to the

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,480
demand signal and have enough capacity

23
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,719
to let the supply flow through this is

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,640
why it's so important to have a demand

25
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,120
plan all parties in the supply chain

26
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,879
rely on that demand signal to know where

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,199
to put their resources for more MIT
