1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,680
we have come to the end of our day and I

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,040
would just want to thank you Houston for

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,599
sharing it with us at MIT we wanted to

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,719
bring you some interesting ideas and

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,400
things that we're working on you heard

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,160
from Liz

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,800
Reynolds brought us some insights on

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,000
policy and things that she was doing at

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,000
the White House and things that she's

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,240
thinking about on Workforce and the

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,559
workforce of the future initiative that

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,280
she ran then Ben Armstrong actually

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,280
figuratively and literally he took over

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,600
her job when she went to the White House

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,719
and then on stage he talked a lot about

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,160
how transformative Technologies are

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
impacting the workforce and shared a

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,000
number of research studies that he's

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:59,559
doing on that uh then we heard from our

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,800
fantastic startups so you know uh we saw

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:08,000
oh is Shi gone oh I loved the uh the

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,479
flexible solar we heard about uh new

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,240
ways to do

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,200
learning uh and how AI is transforming

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,520
manufacturing and

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,119
safety uh and then we had our afternoon

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,759
which I think should be freshen up in

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,600
Your Mind Brian Anthony and car

29
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,720
Pearson uh and then this great panel so

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,119
what I'd love to hear from the audience

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,560
in just our last two minutes on a lot of

32
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,439
you took some good notes what what's a

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,399
key takeaway that you had my table my

34
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,040
guys here what did you what did you

35
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,479
learn what is stuck with you what are

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,479
you bringing back to the

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,719
office thoughts ideas these guys over

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,719
here you got one

39
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,640
go I think they importance of bridging

40
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,880
Academia with corporations and the fact

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
that uh you know like the MIT labs and

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,759
other universities where they have

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,319
funding and they have actually uh

44
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,560
students and uh and mentors and teachers

45
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,519
studying emerging Technologies and uh

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,200
embellishing other things in there that

47
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,560
you're Bridging the the Gap with the

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,560
actual real world and making sure

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,519
there's connections that you don't wait

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,560
till they graduate and then them go on

51
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,080
their own and look for jobs and then uh

52
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,879
connecting them with startups as well I

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,680
think I think that that Trifecta is uh

54
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,319
is crucial yeah and so you heard from

55
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,879
Olivier who said that

56
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,840
91% of MIT students are engaged in

57
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,280
research right they're not just sitting

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,640
in lecture Halls listening they're

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,959
actually rolling up their sleeves and

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,599
getting their hand dirty and that's why

61
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:56,280
MIT is actually ranked number one uh

62
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,120
on preparing students for the workforce

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,120
we're number one on that and I think

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,640
that's that's probably the one of the

65
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,239
stats I'm most proud of because I think

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,120
that as I call myself a pracademic

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,120
that's the most important thing that we

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
need to be doing anyone

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,200
else yeah the takeway that Brian had um

70
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,040
I also agree with him I hate that

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,760
digital twin and a on all these buzzword

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
have complicated matters because a lot

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,519
of this stuff has been around for a long

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,920
time and you're not going to convince

75
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,799
any people that your regular average

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,360
person to adopt this if they're scared

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,680
of it or if to give them something

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
they're familiar with is probably going

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,200
to be more helpful to them to adopt it

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,040
so totally agree with that and it was

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,280
validating to hear that today so

82
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:53,159
awesome right one more over here there

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,159
yeah I I do Innovation at scale and uh

84
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,879
one of the topics about the maturity

85
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:02,599
model for the um cyber security uh the

86
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,959
level five I was thinking okay wow I can

87
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,480
see how our Innovation management

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,599
process would be a perfect fit

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,799
to basically engage the entire Workforce

90
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,079
in coming up with uh or understanding

91
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,040
new ways that uh that cyber impacts are

92
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,160
happening so that was my kind of

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,240
takeaway good

94
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,199
horrific what I learned was like uh it's

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,240
not like the everybody has like a

96
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,199
specific problem right like I see like

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,880
some commonality like AC across the

98
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,280
board like know what people are having

99
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,800
the problem and you guys are researching

100
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,160
and bringing in like some kind of a

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,560
solutioning right like you know how to

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,600
solve this problem right across the

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,120
board that's really good for me like

104
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,320
know working for a startup and then like

105
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,600
know trying to do that stuff I'm

106
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,120
learning like know and and I also know

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
like who to reach out to right like know

108
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,039
if I need more right that's number one

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,960
number two regarding like AI right like

110
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,440
there is a lot of misconception like you

111
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,280
know in the industry learning like you

112
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,039
know how to communicate like those

113
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,800
misconception being a technologist I

114
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,840
know what they are but how to

115
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,320
communicate them to like you know inside

116
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,400
the company right that's very important

117
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,039
right um like our cyber security expert

118
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,039
talked about right like you know how to

119
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,520
make cyber security important like as

120
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,960
part of your like you know company life

121
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,560
right like the great point is like talk

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,240
about like you know I did that like

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,759
locally in my meetings but uh what she

124
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,120
said is like you know tell your like you

125
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,720
know leadership team to talk about

126
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,360
regular safety like know before the

127
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,199
meeting but also talk about cyber

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
security take like one incident and then

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,000
like talk about it as like a safety

130
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,560
incident right so like be authentic and

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,720
be attending yeah so that is very

132
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,520
important to communicate and evangelize

133
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,880
like no cyber security as like a uh what

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,479
do you call part of like know your

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,400

much everybody one thing I learned is

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,160
that we need to have these conversations

147
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,880
because train is moving at full speed

148
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,639
and we don't have Solutions so we need

149
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,479
to share each other's opin opinions and

150
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,880
