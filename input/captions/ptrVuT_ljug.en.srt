MIT slones NBA program as Melissa

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,040
mentioned I'm Kelly I am part of the MBA

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,200
program Office Team um I work as a

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,119
senior associate director Focus mainly

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,920
on academics in the curriculum and I'm

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,199
also one of our uh cohort advisers for

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,160
students in the

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,119
program um so let's get started next

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,800
slide so MIT Sloan's mission is to

12
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,320
develop principled and Innovative

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,599
leaders who improve the world and our

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,399
goal is to give each MBA student two

15
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,600
years full of both the challenge and the

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,520
support that accelerates Learning and

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,680
Development and allows you to reach the

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079
top of your potential as principled and

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,320
Innovative leaders and in the diagram

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,559
that you see here you'll see that the

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,160
student is at the center illustrating

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,600
how you sit at the center of your MBA

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,120
experience and for each student this

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,440
really looks different but no matter

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,480
what experience you come in with or what

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,600
academic and career goals you have set

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,000
for yourself what you can count on is an

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,320
education that encompasses intellectual

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,080
rigor diverse thinking and a priority on

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,280
building leadership skills and funneling

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,439
into these overlaying principles are the

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,840
MBA program pillars of innovative

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,400
Hands-On learning integrated leadership

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,400
development world renowned faculty

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,320
rewarding careers and the MIT experience

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
or

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,240
ecosystem so today as Melissa mentioned

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,479
we're going to focus on the classroom

39
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,000
learning and curriculum elements of

40
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,880
these pillars um the foundation for

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,040
which is our unique one semester MBA

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,280
core next

43
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,040
slide um an integral part of the MBA

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,719
core experience is the support system

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,000
that is embedded from day one so each

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,240
student is assigned to a cohort and a

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,680
core team on the first day of

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,240
orientation using an algorithm to

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,960
maximize diversity of perspectives on a

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,240
number of dimensions and each of the six

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,520
cohorts shown here are named after

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,879
oceans and seas each cohort has 11 core

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,560
teams with six or seven students each so

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,200
a cohorts about 70 something

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,360
students um and students work closely

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,519
with these core teams throughout all

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,080
their core courses each cohort also has

58
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,120
a dedicated MBA program advisor of which

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm one and each core team is matched

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,280
with a seconde core mentor who acts as a

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,480
guide throughout your first 100 days at

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,480
loan next

63
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,640
Slide the MBA core is completed in your

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,840
first fall semester it's a one semester

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,720
core and it consists of Melissa if you

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,400
can

67
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,640
click um it consists of five full

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
semester courses taken with your cohort

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,280
and those courses are economics data

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,959
models and decisions or what we call DMD

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,680
Communications organization processes

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,519
and accounting and then you also take

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,400
leadership challenges for an inclusive

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,720
world or what we call lead week which

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,440
I'll share more about shortly and then

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239

marketing or

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,440
strategy and then after that first core

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
semester you'll have the remaining three

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,879
semesters to tailor your cours workk to

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,519
your specific goals through SLO

85
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,680
electives action learning courses um

86
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,840
courses on Main Campus MIT even cross

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
registering at Harvard's professional

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,799
schools um we have a relationship with

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
them uh perhaps completing a certificate

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,120
or doing a semester abroad through our

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,360
small Exchange program MBA program

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,799
advisors your seconde core Mentor other

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,840
second years and faculty can all be

94
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,879
helpful in thinking through how to

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,959
curate your curriculum over the three

96
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,799
elective semesters

97
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,720
and then you'll see on the right side of

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,400
this slide beyond the core your

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,159
remaining degree requirements are to

100
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,159
complete at least 144 graduate level

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,239
elective units this averages about five

102
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,680
courses per semester depending on which

103
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,160
ones you choose um one of these

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,320
electives must be from our pre-approved

105
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,320
leadership elective list you'll also be

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,120
participating in Sloan intensive period

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,840
or sip week um I'll also share more on

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,000
that shortly and then then the final

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,600
degree requirements in order to graduate

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,440
with your MBA are to obtain a be average

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,680
GPA and complete the four full

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:47,600
semesters next

113
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,919
slide so lead week um is a unique thing

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,759
that was developed to create a core

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,280
educational experience for first

116
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,919
semester MBA students that helps

117
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,320
recognize that being an effective leader

118
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,280
requires a deep understanding of what it

119
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,560
means to be a human and a complex world

120
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,919
for three consecutive days in the middle

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,560
of October first year mbas will take a

122
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,240
break from regular classes and instead

123
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,320
they select six three-hour workshops

124
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,880
distributed evenly across the topics of

125
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,199
leadership ethics and diversity equity

126
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,840
and inclusion or Dei so examples of some

127
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,440
of this year's Workshop titles include

128
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,880
sports rates and gender solving the

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,120
climate crisis an on- roads climate

130
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,440
policy simulator

131
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,360
um leading through storytelling and

132
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,680
ethics in product design and marketing

133
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,199
so not only is lead week an opportunity

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,919
to hear from some amazing experts in

135
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,160
these kind of really interesting areas

136
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,639
but it gives students a chance to be in

137
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,720
the classroom with peers from outside of

138
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,360
their cohort for the first time in the

139
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,400
core semester and to be begin to build

140
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,160
those connections setting up for the

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
next three elective

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,759
semesters I also had mentioned the

143
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,840
degree requirement of slan intensive

144
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,000
period or sip week this requirement can

145
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,759
be fulfilled by completing workshops in

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,680
the spring semester which are similar in

147
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,000
structure to the what I just talked

148
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,120
about with lead week or there's a couple

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,720
other ways to complete this requirement

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,440
you can do it by participating in

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,400
certain action learning Labs TRS or

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Study Tours which all occur over this

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
sip week in mid-march right before

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,639
spring

155
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
break next slide

156
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,000
I had mentioned options to customize

157
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,120
your curriculum and one of those is

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,639
through certificates which are open to

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,319
all Sloan degree students there are

160
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,120
seven certificates that you have the

161
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,240
option of pursuing during your time at

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,599
Sloan certificates are completely

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,000
optional but they provide a curriculum

164
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,520
path for the industry or functions of um

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,560
those listed here so entrepreneurship

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Enterprise management Finance business

167
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,360
Analytics product management health care

168
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,479
and

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,639
sustainability students who complete the

170
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,720
set of requirements set forth by the

171
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,560
certificate will receive the certificate

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
in addition to their degree at

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
graduation and particularly for career

174
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,199
Changers certificates can be very

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,199
helpful in giving direction to your

176
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,759
course choices signaling a concentration

177
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,840
area to potential employers and

178
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,000
facilitating connections with students

179
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,199
who have similar career

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,199
goals next slide

181
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,599
um so unlike uh some possibly peer

182
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,919
schools MIT Sloan does not follow just

183
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,759
one teaching method you'll see case

184
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,479
studies small group projects traditional

185
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,720
lectures across all of our electives and

186
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,319
often um if not always within the same

187
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,000
course they they switch up the teaching

188
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,319
methods however if I was to name one

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,039
signature kind of teaching F method at

190
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,520
loan I talk about action learning

191
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,120
through action learning courses or we

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
call them Labs students apply the theory

193
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,240
and Concepts that they're learning in

194
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,039
the classroom to real business

195
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,080
challenges posed by external company

196
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,319
sponsor sponsors um in each year Sloan

197
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,960
faculty offer over 15 action learning

198
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,280
courses focusing on either a regional

199
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,120
area an in industry or an inter

200
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,120
interdisciplinary topic many of these

201
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,639
action learning Labs include travel to

202
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,560
spend time at the location of the

203
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,639
company sponsor but some remain local on

204
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,200
campus and these courses are very

205
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,959
popular with Sloan students because they

206
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,240
offer a practical opportunity to learn

207
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,839
how to structure and solve problems how

208
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,839
to collaborate effectively in a team and

209
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,880
how to lead through complex situations

210
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,600
so I've listed a few of our popular

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,200
action learning Labs here but you can

212
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,120
see our full roster of offerings on

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,560
Sloan's action learning web page next

214
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,440
slide as I mentioned at the beginning

215
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,240
developing principes leaders is in our

216
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,360
mission statement and the MIT Leadership

217
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,680
Center believes that this involves

218
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,880
pursuing Deeper Self and other awareness

219
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,040
at three levels individual team and

220
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,680
organization so the three course

221
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,519
elective sequence here maps to each of

222
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,079
these levels starting with idlab which

223
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,880
is built on the premise that being an

224
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,040
effective leader starts with

225
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,600
understanding yourself so traditional

226
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,399
CRA classroom learning Executive

227
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,959
coaching and informal interactions with

228
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,360
classmates are combined to provide an

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,959
environment for individual

230
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,600
transformation in this um ID lab

231
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,240
elective the suggested path is then to

232
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,560
take teams lab and conclude with leading

233
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,000
with impact which was formerly called

234
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,360
ORS lab or organization's

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,320
lab uh next

236
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,120
slide and then as you can imagine there

237
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,760
is a lot of action around Ai and the

238
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,839
curriculum lately and we often get asked

239
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,880
about what we are doing in this area at

240
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,399
Sloan so I wanted to highlight a little

241
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,720
bit of that here last summer the MBA

242
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,360
program introduced a new workshop for

243
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,600
incoming mbas led by Professor Eric so

244
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,200
this Workshop was designed to lay the

245
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,440
foundation for discovering the latest AI

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,079
Technologies and how to choose the right

247
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,000
tools to use for learning practical ways

248
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,120
to incorporate AI into your daily tasks

249
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,240
for understanding AI ethics and it gave

250
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,600
Hands-On exercises for classroom

251
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,360
applications um and this was something

252
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,000
that was offered incoming mbas as a kind

253
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,440
of foundational level setting Workshop

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,959
as they entered the

255
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,320
program a faculty we've we've had some

256
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:52,120
courses um in this area for a while but

257
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,200
faculty have introduced two new courses

258
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,040
designed to equip managers and founders

259
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,639
with the tools needed to excel in the

260
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,040
future of gen and those um this year

261
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,399
were gen for managers and gen lab which

262
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,920
is an action learning course and these

263
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
courses are a deep dive into how gen

264
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,519
Works its use cases and business

265
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,279
implications for those managing teams

266
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,680
all the way up to the executive level on

267
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,240
the technical side operations research

268
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,680
faculty have have designed Hands-On deep

269
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,320
learning this is a course focused on the

270
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
engine behind predictive and generative

271
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,639
AI with an emphasis on developing a deep

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,040
Hands-On understanding of how to build

273
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,959
the models to solve complex problems

274
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,480
involving the processing of unstructured

275
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,639
inputs so like how do we detect If a

276
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,160
driver is falling asleep and

277
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,639
unstructured outputs so how do we

278
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,839
summarize the content of a customer

279
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,040
service call

280
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,240
transcript next

281
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,519
slide and in addition to Ai and action

282
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,839
learning and the leadership courses that

283
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,920
I've just mentioned here are just a few

284
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,360
other courses new to Sloan's elective

285
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,680
offering brings this year and a

286
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,000
selection of others that may have been

287
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,800
around for a while but are consistently

288
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,800
popular with our

289
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
students next

290
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,560
slide and then finally um just carrying

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,519
on with the kind of how to curate your

292
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,120
academic experience in your elective

293
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,800
semesters we also offer several dual

294
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,560
degree programs and other um other

295
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,040
offerings so we have the LG lgo program

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,519
which is a dual degree between

297
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,720
engineering and MBA we have a dual

298
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,680
degree with Harvard Kennedy School which

299
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,560
combines public policy and MBA we have a

300
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,720
dual degree with MIT Department of urban

301
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
studies and

302
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,800
planning um and then we have some

303
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,600
students that come in with a legatum

304
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
fellowship and these students are

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,160
focused on entrepreneurship and emerging

306
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,959
markets and as I mentioned we have a

307
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,360
small Exchange program with London

308
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,600
Business School and Esa in Barcelona

309
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,320
which um allows a small number of MBA

310
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,560
students to do a semester abroad at

311
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
those

312
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,920
schools next

313
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:17,320
slide great um so I hope that this gives

314
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,839
you a better idea of not only the Core

315
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,959
Curriculum and the degree requirements

316
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,240
but also the many academic options and

317
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,880
just highlights the level of flexibility

318
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,880
that you have within Sloan's MBA

319
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,240
program and I'll close it there and I'm

320
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,040
happy to take any questions perfect

321
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,880
thanks Kelly I'm going to stop my screen

322
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,720
so it's easier to see we have so so so

323
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,079
many questions in the chat so let's get

324
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
to it um the first question for you

325
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,079
Kelly is in January we don't have

326
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,199
classes at MIT it's called IAP can you

327
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,480
just tell us a little bit what is I AP

328
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,199
and what does students do during this

329
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,680
time yeah um great question uh so yes so

330
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,560
at MIT the fall semester ends in mid

331
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,320
December

332
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,600
but the spring semester doesn't start

333
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,800
until the first week of February so that

334
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,240
January period is called IAP or

335
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,000
independent activities period and this

336
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,199
is something that's been um it's an MIT

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,880
not a Sloan uh Innovation I guess but

338
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,839
it's been around for a long time and the

339
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,639
concept behind MIT is that it gives I'm

340
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,399
sorry the concept behind IAP is that it

341
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:27,519
gives MIT students um a a break from the

342
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,240
rigorous academics so that they have

343
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,480
time to explore wide variety of

344
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,680
workshops offered by members of the MIT

345
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,680
community so not for credit workshops

346
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,360
are offered during this January period

347
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,399
on everything from Japanese flower

348
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,839
arranging to like studying regenerative

349
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,959
food to tours of the MIT Wright brothers

350
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,880
wind tunnel so that's kind of what iip

351
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,440
um was designed for but there are also

352
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,639
several of several four credit classes

353
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,079
that happened during IP particularly

354
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,839
some of the action learning courses um

355
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,880
travel over IAP so if you choose you can

356
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,560
earn some credits during IAP um and

357
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,600
depending on your career interest you

358
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,720
may be really busy with um recruiting um

359
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,800
on campus recruiting during that month

360
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,000
particularly for some finance and

361
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,399
Consulting roles and Tech likely um so

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,560
in short there are many things you can

363
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,600
do an iip you can earn credit you can do

364
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,040
workshops you might be recruiting but

365
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,120
there's nothing you're required to do

366
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,720
you're not required to be here and many

367
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,880
students just use it as a chance to

368
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,800
relax to visit family and just catch up

369
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,600
on some much needed sleep after a very

370
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,040
busy cor sem awesome thank you we have a

371
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,480
lot of questions about cross

372
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,800
collaboration and cross registration so

373
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,000
I know you can take three classes

374
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,000
outside of Sloan um can you share a

375
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,199
little bit more about how that

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,319
works yeah so um uh MBA students can

377
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,600
take up to three nons Sloan courses um

378
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,319
towards their degree requirements so up

379
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,560
to three courses can count towards that

380
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:10,079
144 elective unit requirement that I

381
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,639
mentioned nons slown means anything on

382
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:17,160
Main Campus or anything cross-registered

383
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:20,360
at Harvard um if youve perused our MIT

384
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,720
course catalog you'll notice that course

385
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,399
anything that starts with a number 15 is

386
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,839
considered a Sloan course it's taught by

387
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,560
Sloan faculty um and anything that

388
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:29,440
doesn't start with a number 15 is

389
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,160
considered

390
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,120
nonl uh you can take more than three

391
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,480
nonl or Harvard courses it's just that

392
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,079
only three will count towards those 144

393
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,360
um and they have to be graduate level

394
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,360
courses in order to count awesome thank

395
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,720
you so in terms of the first semester

396
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,040
what does the class schedule look like

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,639
or the hours um when can students be

398
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,920
expected to be on campus great question

399
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,279
so each cohort has a different um

400
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,480
schedule and you will learn that

401
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,680
schedule

402
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,360
uh few days before orientation when you

403
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,799
get your cohort assignment um but you

404
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,199
can expect that classes will not start

405
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:14,600
any earlier than 8:30 and won't end any

406
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,400
earlier than 5:00 pm unless you are

407
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,079
taking a certificate that offers an

408
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,360
evening um certificate seminar and those

409
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,520
meet on Monday evenings there is a lunch

410
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,280
block um which is free from classes

411
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,080
that's from 11:30 to 1 um that is when a

412
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,120
lot of uh Club you know guest speakers

413
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,160
happen um your core team meetings you

414
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,080
might have coffee chat scheduled during

415
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,799
that block so that's a block that's

416
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,080
protected from classes um and classes

417
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:50,360
run Monday through Thursday Fridays you

418
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,080
won't have any courses but you will have

419
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,600
um optional recitations for some of our

420
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,679
classes and recitations are where the TA

421
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,440
offers like review sessions for what you

422
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,480
learned in class that week

423
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,960
um there are two Fridays in the core

424
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,120
semester generally in early September

425
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,159
that there are required special sessions

426
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,559
of your core courses um and we would

427
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,280
share those dates uh the summer prior to

428
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,799
you coming great a lot of questions on

429
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,400
certificates so are certificates a

430
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
requirement how many of them can you do

431
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,840
can you still cross collaborate with

432
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,039
other courses if you choose to do

433
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,240
certificates so a lot of certificate

434
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,840
questions great yeah certificates are

435
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,640
not required they are completely

436
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,360
optional and like I said they're open to

437
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:39,720
um all of loan and some are even open to

438
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,760
um MIT graduate students as well uh they

439
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,400
are so there are seven certificates in

440
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,840
total you can complete up to two

441
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,200
certificates during your time in the

442
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,840
program um and you can cross count up to

443
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,960
two courses towards the requirements so

444
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,240
if you know managerial Finance is an

445
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,280
option on sustainability and the finance

446
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
certificate

447
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,159
then you could count that towards both

448
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,320
but you can only do that for two courses

449
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,960
um and the certificates are not it's

450
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,200
it's I believe the certificates are

451
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,799
between like 35 and 45 units to complete

452
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,000
a certificate so it tends to happen that

453
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,320
if you're generally interested in one of

454
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,159
those areas chances are it's not going

455
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,280
to be a real challenge for you to

456
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,280
complete the certificate units so it's

457
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,200
about you know less than half of your

458
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,159
elective units that you would Dev vote

459
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,799
toward the certificate so you do have

460
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,400
plenty of space to take courses outside

461
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,440
of that particular functional

462
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,200
area great so switching to action

463
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,640
learning Labs how many action learning

464
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,919
Labs do you think students generally

465
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,480
take um

466
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,960
I I've never actually pulled the numbers

467
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:57,200
on that I would say most students take

468
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,159
one during their time um some students

469
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,720
might take two I I

470
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,320
don't think I've seen a scenario where

471
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,159
student has been able to take more than

472
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,159
two but I could be wrong um but yeah I

473
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,799
would say the majority of our students

474
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,600
it's uh it's something that they place a

475
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,280
high priority on when they come in that

476
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,000
they want to take at least one action

477
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,400
learning lab great um can you share a

478
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,440
little bit more about competitions and

479
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,679
things that kind of happens happen

480
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,280
across

481
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,320
campus

482
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,000
um as yes it

483
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:36,200
so outside of academics a little bit

484
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,760
outside going outside um so yeah there

485
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,919
are uh a lot of student L clubs there

486
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,200
are a bunch of student L com conferences

487
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,480
we just wrapped up um our investment

488
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
management club uh sponsored a stock

489
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,159
petch competition I think it was last

490
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,760
week um where they invited a bunch of

491
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:57,039
schools here to do a stock pitch

492
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:59,120
competition um our clubs often our our

493
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,240
clubs often go like organiz themselves

494
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,760
and go to other competitions there is a

495
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,600
large MIT ecosystem of events and

496
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,919
centers and initiatives that you can

497
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,919
take advantage of um we also have a

498
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,320
really active significant others and

499
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,960
partners community so your significant

500
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,240
others and partners can get involved um

501
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,520
but I would leave that to another

502
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,320
webinar to talk more specifically about

503
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,720
the events outside of the classroom um

504
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,720
but it's it's very robust and it's we

505
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,840
say it's drinking from a fire hose right

506
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,440
so it's just about figuring out what

507
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,480
your goals are and trying to prioritize

508
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,039
how you spend your time based on those

509
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,440
goals totally yes there's a lot going on

510
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,919
outside the classroom um so I know we

511
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,960
talked a little bit about the leadership

512
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,960
sequence is the leadership sequence a

513
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,279
required set of courses that all mbas

514
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,720
need to take good question no so the

515
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,679
sequence that I showed of the ID lab

516
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,000
teams lab and orgs lab is a

517
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,000
recommendation for um mbas from the MIT

518
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,760
Leadership Center based on mit's

519
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,440
leadership philosophy um so you were not

520
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,240
required to take that sequence um they

521
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,360
are really popular courses in particular

522
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,559
ID lab and teams lab um you get

523
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,640
executive one-on-one coaching through

524
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:17,520
those courses which is a really great

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,480
benefit uh and ID lab in particular is

526
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,640
only open to first year mbas but it's

527
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,320
not required but they do meet um so

528
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,960
there is a requirement to take one

529
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,480
leadership elective those courses are on

530
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,840
that list and then there's also about 15

531
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,200
or 20 other courses on that list so

532
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,799
those would meet that requirement

533
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,840
awesome um can you touch upon how Sloan

534
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,960
students collaborate with like the media

535
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:47,960
lab C sales Center For Real

536
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:50,760
Estate Etc yeah um so there all of those

537
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,919
centers um I would say the most popular

538
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,799
way that Sloan students collaborate is

539
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,760
they all offer courses um so you can

540
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:02,080
take courses that fall under media lab

541
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,720
and Center For Real Estate and Cale um

542
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,640
and those would likely be part of that

543
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,840
one nons slown course limit um they all

544
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,080
tend to have uh speaker series and

545
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,000
events so if you get on their mailing

546
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,640
list you can um be active with them

547
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,679
there uh I mean depending on your

548
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,240
background and interest there might be

549
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,840
opportunities to work with faculty from

550
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,000
those areas on Research through a

551
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,200
research assistant position um

552
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,520
but I would say most often it's just

553
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,039
through taking their courses um

554
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,840
attending their speaker series taking

555
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,600
courses that bring Sloan students and

556
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,679
those students together um some of our

557
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,120
Ventures courses like fintech Ventures

558
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,279
or any energy Ventures tend to have um

559
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,039
collaborative team projects with

560
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,559
students from outside of Sloan who are

561
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:57,080
active in those

562
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,440
areas great we got a few questions of is

563
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,159
it possible to trans ER credits that

564
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,120
somebody has done before Sloan and

565
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,760
transfer them to the core or another

566
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,520
elective H good question no Sloan does

567
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,400
not accept transfer units um so the core

568
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,760
courses are required there are no

569
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,760
waivers for any of the core

570
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,400
courses great um thank you so a lot of

571
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,039
questions about dual degrees if you just

572
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,000
want to share very briefly about the

573
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,320
Dual degree um and how that process

574
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
works yes so our dual to be with

575
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,360
HKS um Melissa I'm actually not if you

576
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,240
are more familiar with how that

577
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,440
emmissions process works I'll leave that

578
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,039
to you I can I can totally answer this

579
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,159
one so many of the questions are about

580
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:48,240
like HKS and lgo so for both of these

581
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:51,520
dual degrees you have to apply for HKS

582
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,159
concurrently to both HKS and Sloan at

583
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,880
the same time in our round two and you'd

584
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,000
have to be admitted to both of them to

585
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,200
be considered and for the leaders for

586
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,799
Global operations you have to apply

587
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,679
directly to the lgo program to be

588
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,360
considered for both MBA and lgo and if

589
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,600
your application is unsuccessful for lgo

590
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,679
you're automatically considered for MBA

591
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,320
in round

592
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,440
two I hope that helps um all right we'll

593
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,880
do like one more question if that's okay

594
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,000
Kelly so how hard is it to get into the

595
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,720
elective classes that students want to

596
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,720
take uh if it's if you're referring to

597
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,120
the core electives where you have a

598
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,720
choice of one of the four core electives

599
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,679
we um you will rank your choices in the

600
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,279
onboarding process and then we'll assign

601
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,799
students based on their choice um last

602
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:44,520
year everybody was able to get their

603
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:47,559
first choice of core elective uh with

604
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,039
the electives um beyond the core the

605
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,240
three sem the remaining three semesters

606
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:54,320
we have a bidding system for slan

607
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,480
electives uh so you're given a certain

608
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,000
amount of points and you use those to

609
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,720
bid for the courses that you want

610
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,880
um and you know second year and your

611
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,600
advisers and everything do presentations

612
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,559
and share strategies on kind of how to

613
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,559
how bidding and and course registration

614
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:14,000
Works once you hit your elective

615
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:16,799
semesters but um I think the best

616
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,120
strategy is to just choose you know the

617
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,279
one or two courses each semester that

618
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:27,120
really are most important to you to take

619
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:29,640
and put the priority on that um for how

620
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,559
how you bid but yes there are some so

621
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,760
the bidding system um is based on

622
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,559
priority of graduation year so second

623
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,440
years would get first priority first

624
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,440
year would get second priority um but if

625
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,159
you are really serious about wanting to

626
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,000
get into the course and you're strategic

627
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,760
and how you bid um there's very high

628
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,760
chances that you'll be able to take that

629
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,880
by the time the program concludes great

630
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,039
all right one more Kelly um a lot of

631
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,919
questions on how students manage their

632
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,080
day-to-day activities balancing the

633
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,279
course work with things outside what

634
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,480
have you seen as an

635
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:08,960
adviser yeah so

636
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,840
um the core Mentor is really helpful in

637
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,080
this because um the core mentors meet

638
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,799
regularly with the core teams and since

639
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,159
you're working very closely with your

640
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,720
core team throughout all of the core

641
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,240
courses so the load isn't just on you

642
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,640
you have your core team to lean on and

643
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,960
the core teams are particularly designed

644
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,720
so that everybody comes in with

645
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,320
different backgrounds and expertise um

646
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,360
so you're almost sort of mentoring each

647
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,919
other in your core team as you're going

648
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,039
through the classes as well as having

649
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,720
that core mentor on top of it um but

650
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:48,799
it's calendaring is a really important

651
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,120
thing blocking time out for yourself and

652
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,840
again just understanding that yes your

653
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,399
goals might change from the time you

654
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,200
come in to the time you leave um or even

655
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,320
three weeks into the semester but your

656
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,640
program adviser can really work with you

657
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,840
to think about what your goals are and

658
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,880
then prioritize what you spend time on

659
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,799
in particular in your core semester um

660
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,679
because you don't have to do everything

661
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,080
that you wanted to get done at Loan in

662
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:16,880
your first semester you can choose one

663
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,679
or two of those things to really focus

664
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,360
on in your first semester and then leave

665
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,840
some other things for the other three

666
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,840
elective

667
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,600
semesters Perfect all right well Kelly

668
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,000
we got through a lot of questions I hope

669
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,960
everyone's questions were answered um

670
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,240
but if you have any questions after this

671
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,600
please let the admissions team know I'm

672
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,039

all going to be about the application I

682
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,200
about the application but we really

683
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,840
