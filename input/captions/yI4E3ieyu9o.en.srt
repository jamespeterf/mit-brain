14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,719
>> to a uh who's going to uh uh give us a

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,600
guest lecture on on art games. And uh

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,200
today's reading uh the the proc reading

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
is kind of like part two of a lot of

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,280
things that uh Jason Begley talked about

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,360
uh when we did simulations. So um kind

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
if you guys remember his talk while you

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,360
were reading that that that sequest and

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
what that came from. Um, one thing that

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
I actually forgot to address was that

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
there are actually a couple of uh

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,879
responses to that uh to that article. If

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
you scroll all the way down to the

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,200
bottom of the article, there's these

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,200
responses by Arisman and Mizuki and him

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
back to them. And uh those are kind of

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
interesting uh you know because it just

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,720
sort of carries on a conversation and

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
people are actually just sort of turning

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
his article into basically a blog post

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
and then writing comments. um and they

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,560
were pretty good but a lot of that was

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,439
kind of the state of art game discussion

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,759
back in 999 I think I think it's a

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,920
pretty old article um where they were

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
very much thinking about you know games

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,040
can games have to be simulations you

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,360
know games and narratives uh you know

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,159
storytelling is like some other mediums

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,720
do uh medium domain it's all about the

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,200
simulation um and um and arguably at

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,880
that time there wasn't a big discussion

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
of an art games movement. There were

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
other games movements like new games

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,000
like like like new games which were

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,000
really more about uh people interacting

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,320
with trying to get games to where people

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,719
were more cooperative, less competitive

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,759
and less cut through. Um there were

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,640
other mo there were movements about um

54
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,959
people um there were probably

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,560
advertising game movements and there

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,840
were there were a lot there was a lot of

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,840
work in people making mods of computer

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
games that effectively made it

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
unplayable but made really pretty images

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
in the process. Um so that there was a

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
Doom hack for instance where everything

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
becomes black and white and and is

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,760
striped including the monsters. It's

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,599
like there's no way they can see what

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
the hell's going on but they look pretty

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
cool. Um,

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
>> yep.

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,599
>> Have you seen I think it's 96 kilobytes.

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
>> There was a competition to make a full

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,640
game in a really really small size. No,

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,800
it's 4 kilobytes I think and it's a 4

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
kilob game in full 3D with multiple

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
levels and they have extremely cle

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,519
including the music and everything

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
>> like Yeah.

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
>> And have you ever heard of this or seen?

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
>> There are a couple of those u and a lot

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,920
of those come out from the demo scene.

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,040
Uh the demo scene uh which I will put

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,879
off to some other

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,040
>> very artsy too. It's like very

82
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,200
>> Yeah. It it it's kind of this weird

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,599
thing of like computer hacking, really

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,920
really fast and really really compact

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,000
coding and visual aesthetics and music.

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,800
Uh which you know it's more of like a

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,720
digital music video. Um only there was

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,959
some people who added a mouse control

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,360
and gameplay into it and made these tiny

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,599
little games. Um but uh that that was

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,800
pretty much art that that's very

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,720
different from the art game scene that

93
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,959
we have today or at least what is

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
commonly described as our games. So, uh,

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,120
I, um, I'd like to aid to talk about

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,120
kind of what happened from, um, since

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
then, since, uh, since 99.

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,560
>> Yeah.

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
>> Yeah. So, hi guys. I'm I'm, uh, Abe. Uh,

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
I work here at the lab. I've played a

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,159
bunch of your games. I've met a bunch of

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,920
you. Um, so it's it's nice to be here.

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
Philip uh, asked me to come in to talk

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,720
about, uh, quote unquote art games. Uh I

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,120
think largely because it's a kind of um

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,400
uh I'll say sector of kind of game

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,560
development that uh my work at Gambit

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,480
tends to intersect with um especially

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,599
recently. Um and I think too that it's

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,599
um

111
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,599
>> sorry

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,640
I don't know. I think too that it's um I

113
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
think too that it's a uh it's kind of a

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,040
sector that's that's a little bit

115
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,079
confused and um and possibly confusing

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,519
too. And so um just to give you guys a

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,520
sense um you know when he asked me about

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,800
this it actually made me it kind of made

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,919
me think cuz I was like oh yeah cool.

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,360
I'll talk about like this art games

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,000
movement or whatever but you know then

122
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,440
of course um wait I'm locked into some

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,320
kind of weird mode right now.

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,759
Sorry. Okay. Um that brings up this

125
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,759
question which is which is our games

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,680
art. And just to um just to kind of give

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,000
you a a sense for how this this little

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
talk thing whatever is going to go um

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm going to talk a little bit about

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
this question um give you kind of

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,360
examples of what people have said about

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
this um and opinions that I think are

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
particularly important particularly

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,800
valid on this subject. Um I also after

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,320
that want to show you some examples um

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
some historical and then kind of moving

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
forward examples. I'm actually going to

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
get some of you guys to to just come up

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,560
here and maybe even play some of these

140
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
examples that I think are particularly

141
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
important. And and I'd really like it if

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,639
we can kind of keep this less of a uh me

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,240
talking at you and and you engaging me

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,479
as you have questions on this because I

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
it's really like me you know blabbing at

146
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,440
you as you fall asleep is is um you know

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
maybe good for a nap but less useful for

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,440
um you know getting anything out of

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
this. Um, so we'll try to structure this

150
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,240
as a conversation and and I'll I'll try

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,919
to pull back hearken back to any of my

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
teacher instincts and see if I can get

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,960
you engaged, but we'll see. Um, so our

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
game's art I um I hate this question.

155
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,080
Uh, I will start off by saying that I

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,680
fundamentally and I find it abhorent and

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,280
I hear it all the time. Um, and it's

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
aggravating to me because I think it's

159
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,800
it's incontrovertibly yes. Um I think

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,720
that you can't possibly come up with any

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,880
other answer other than yes, games are

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,840
art, games have art. Yes. Yes. Yes.

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,240
Right. But um it keeps coming up and it

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,639
keeps kind of becoming a question. And I

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,080
should say too that this is a um this is

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,039
a wholly biased and uh slanted talk.

167
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,160
This is this is my perspective on this

168
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,440
and hopefully by the time you're done

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,039
you'll be like wow he is absolutely

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,360
right. There is no way that games could

171
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,880
be anything but art. Um or at least they

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,720
are art and then some. Um, so, um, this

173
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,720
guy, um, who's a little hard to see

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,120
right now, but he's totally blown up.

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
Um, recently brought this into the for

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,080
um, and that's, uh, that's Roger Eert

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
of, uh, Eert System Eert fame, or since

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,600
you guys are some of you younger than

179
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,039
me, probably Eert and Roer. Um, and he

180
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
had some interesting and controversial

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,360
comments recently. Um, and I I pulled

182
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,880
this quote. Nevertheless, I remain

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,759
convinced that in principle, I love that

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,000
he put that in uh italics. Video games

185
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,840
cannot be art. Perhaps it is foolish of

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
me to say never because never, as Rick

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,319
Wakeakeman informs us, is a long, long

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,400
time. Let me just say that no video

189
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,479
gamer now living will survive long

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
enough to experience the medium as an

191
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,560
art form. Um, so apparently we should

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
all be dead already, um, according to

193
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
Eert because we wouldn't have lived long

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,479
enough to experience the medium as an

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,599
art form. But here's a guy who um even

196
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
though I don't think he's a particularly

197
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
good film critic, he's a popular film

198
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
critic and he's kind of weighing in on a

199
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,599
medium that he doesn't particularly

200
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
understand. And I think it's important

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,319
to look at what exactly is he doing when

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
he makes this statement. And so he's in

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
this kind of business of classification,

204
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
right? He's in this business of saying,

205
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,199
"All right, well, we've got this subject

206
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,360
called art. What can we say falls under

207
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,720
that subset and what what what does

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
not?" And so, you know, he says things

209
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
like painting, sculpture, dance, opera,

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,400
literature, film um can all be

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,280
classified as art and and that games um

212
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
games are not. Um probably some other

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,759
things. I don't know where he stands on

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
comic books. I don't think he's written

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
about it yet, but I'm sure he can

216
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
probably I don't know where he what he

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
thinks about pornography. Um although

218
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,680
since it's in film form, maybe he does

219
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,919
think it's art. It's unclear. He hasn't

220
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
he hasn't weighed in on that yet. Um but

221
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,039
the interesting thing about this is this

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
is not this is not new, right? This is

223
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,240
like a high culture, low culture debate

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
that's been going on for a really long

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,080
time. And I think it's particularly

226
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,680
hilarious because he reviews films and

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,680
films had to fight out of the low

228
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,759
culture phenomenon to gain respect as a

229
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,639
high culture medium, right? And so he's

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,479
he's working reviewing a medium that

231
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,919
that was once conceived as low culture,

232
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,360
had to work really hard to be considered

233
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,440
high culture. And now he's saying,

234
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
"Look, my films are high culture, your

235
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,960
video games are low culture." um which

236
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,879
is totally hilarious because you know in

237
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,640
the past 50 years um this has been

238
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,159
completely collapsed by postmodernism

239
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
right but this is a this is that's a

240
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,800
whole another talk alto together right

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
like maybe high culture and low culture

242
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
don't even exist anymore um so Ebert

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,599
brings this all back and he get

244
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,959
everybody upset and a bunch of trolls

245
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,480
are on his website saying really

246
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,720
terrible things about him and about what

247
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,839
he said but he he kind of reinvigorated

248
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,160
this talk um and so a new scientist

249
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
inspired by this eert controversy and

250
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,040
looking for content um on culture lab

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,640
asked the question can games VR and they

252
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
sent it out to a bunch of game scholars

253
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,680
saying what what is your opinion on

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,000
this? Um and Ian Bogost is is a is a

255
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
very smart guy and and said says you

256
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,839
know some really interesting things.

257
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
This is really long. I'm not going to

258
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,720
read the whole thing but in the first

259
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,240
paragraph you know he brings up things

260
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,480
like fountain uh by Marcel Duchamp which

261
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,519
is you know a urinal um in a museum for

262
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
those of you who don't know about it.

263
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
And that was, you know, that was a

264
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,920
statement, a piece of art that he was

265
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
literally trying to confront what what

266
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
high culture defines as art by taking

267
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,519
literally a urinal, putting it upside

268
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,279
down on art and titling it fountain,

269
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,399
upside down on a pedal and titling it

270
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
fountain and putting it in a museum,

271
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,279
which is the pinnacle of high culture,

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
right? If you can make it in a museum,

273
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
your art. Um, and so, you know, this is

274
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
something that, you know, that he did.

275
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,360
He he mentions Yoko Ono's performance

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
art where, um, she's sitting in a chair

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,720
um, and she has scissors next to her and

278
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,440
the audience is invited to come uh, cut

279
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
her clothes off one piece at a time. um

280
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
you know a lot of this kind of stuff you

281
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,839
know uh Andy Warhol pop culture

282
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,839
paintings um you know Mandrean's uh kind

283
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
of uh you know abstract paintings and

284
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,800
and um you know he says a lot in that

285
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,160
first paragraph but I think this this

286
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
interesting part that I sort of pseudo

287
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,600
highlighted down here is interesting um

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
starting in the middle he says if the

289
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
purpose of art is indeed to force us to

290
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
see something we thought we understood

291
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,040
in a new light perhaps the most

292
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,279
fundamental move video games have made

293
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,040
in the artistic tradition is in the very

294
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,560
eliciting of the question can video

295
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,680
games be art I I think that's really

296
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
interesting, right? So, the fact that

297
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,800
people are even asking this question

298
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,959
suggests that video games are doing

299
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,720
something that aren't we traditionally

300
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,079
conceive of aren't doing. Um, and so

301
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,279
that's, you know, that's I think a

302
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,440
really kind of powerful statement that

303
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,440
that we're even having this discussion.

304
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
It kind of renders the question question

305
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,720
moot in some senses, which which is, you

306
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,160
know, kind of I would say classic Bosian

307
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,240
um word play. Um, I think I just made

308
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,920
something up called Bosian.

309
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,839
tweet him about. Um, so John Sharp from

310
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,200
the Savannah College of Art Design um

311
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,880
has had a lot of kind of thoughts on

312
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
this. He's and he's actually a great

313
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
person to talk about this because he

314
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,880
studies video games, but he does it from

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
an art history background as well,

316
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,399
right? And that's particularly useful.

317
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
Um, and uh, you know, he talks about

318
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,079
some interesting things here. He talks

319
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,920
about, you know, similarly similarly to

320
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,160
what Ian was doing. He's talking a bit

321
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
about how um you know video games and

322
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,760
art are are kind of doing some similar

323
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,600
things at times and yet games you know

324
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,279
have certain affordances that other

325
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,320
media do not. Um and so uh he says at

326
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,399
the end here which I think is

327
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
interesting all this poses the question

328
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
of why are we concerned with giving

329
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,560
video games the status of art? This is

330
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
one of the reasons why I hate this

331
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,839
question. Are we simply trying to

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
legitimize them? Does being called quote

333
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
unquote art change the qualities of

334
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,880
video games? Um only if we can answer

335
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
these questions can we move the

336
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
conversation forward? And I I think he's

337
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
you know he's reacting here to the

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
question itself. Actually he and Ian

339
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,519
both are kind of reacting to the

340
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,920
question. Ian saying the question

341
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,240
invalidates itself and John Sharp now

342
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,240
saying that we need this question it's

343
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,000
not helping us asking you know how does

344
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,079
calling it art what does that do for the

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
medium? That's the important question

346
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,279
right and so here's some some thoughts

347
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,720
about the question and and some kind of

348
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,839
more evidence for why I think the

349
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,240
question are video games art is just h

350
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,760
makes my spine problem. Um, Mary

351
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,079
Flanigan uh sort of takes it uh takes it

352
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
as being assumed that video games are

353
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
art, which I think is actually great. In

354
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
Critical Play, she doesn't go to great

355
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,560
lengths to define video games as art.

356
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,320
She just looks at art and she looks at

357
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,399
games and and compares them. Um, and she

358
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
just kind of assumes that this is so and

359
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
I think this is a really nice quote from

360
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
from really the beginning of her

361
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
critical playbook. Um, where she says,

362
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,320
"Critical play is built on the premise

363
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,839
that as with other media, games carry

364
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
beliefs within their representation

365
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,120
systems and mechanics." This is really

366
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,959
important. artists using games as a

367
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
medium of expression. Again, good use of

368
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,360
italics. Um, then manipulate elements

369
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
common to games, representation, systems

370
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,279
and styles, rules of progress, codes of

371
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,480
conduct, context of perception, winning

372
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,320
and losing paradigms, ways of

373
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,000
interacting in a game. For they are the

374
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
material properties of game, much like

375
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,680
marble and chisel or pen and ink bring

376
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
with them their own intended

377
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
possibilities, limitations, and

378
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,360
conventions. It's a great point. You

379
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,760
would have a really hard time making a

380
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,040
painting with a chisel um and no paint,

381
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
right? Like if you were using marble and

382
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
a chisel and you were trying to make a

383
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
painting, right? Two different things.

384
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
Both are art. It's the same thing with

385
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,519
games, right? Games have rule sets.

386
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,279
Games have systems. Uh games have, you

387
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,279
know, win loss paradigms. They have all

388
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,040
these things that are um kind of

389
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,880
conventions and and things that we

390
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
associate with with even our definition

391
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,000
of what a game is, which is at times

392
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,279
faulty. Um but but those are our tools.

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,639
Those are how we communicate things. And

394
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,040
I think her first sentence is really

395
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,320
important. And um I'm guessing with the

396
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
with the stuff that you've been talking

397
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
about with them and Gonzalo Frasa um you

398
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
know that that's kind of coming through

399
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,160
and and I actually see that in your

400
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,920
games right you're trying to so for

401
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,920
example I I play tested that FedEx game

402
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,519
and I play tested um the game about

403
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
marriage right and there's there's all

404
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,519
kinds of meaning in those systems and

405
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,680
meanings in those choices that you get

406
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,279
um that that are being communicated and

407
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,639
that's that's very similar to what an

408
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,079
artist would do with with any other

409
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
medium right you're you're communicating

410
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,360
a message through those and and and

411
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,120
sometimes we do it accidentally it's

412
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,480
it's not always explicit Right. It's

413
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,200
like we we make something. I I always

414
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,639
say that the the um the graveyard and

415
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,480
when you get divorced and you put your

416
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
your divorced person in the graveyard

417
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,760
was an interesting choice for me because

418
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
it was creating an equivalence between

419
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,519
divorce and death which I think is kind

420
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,519
of interesting. Um so that's just you

421
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,600
know kind of one interesting example. Um

422
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
so Mary Flang in her book talks about

423
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,480
this art movement called Plexus. Before

424
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,639
I go on any kind of thoughts or

425
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,079
questions does anybody else think does

426
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,560
anybody think video games aren't art

427
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,399
still? It's okay. Oh crap, I'm gonna

428
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,440
fight.

429
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
>> Totally different. Like when we were

430
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,680
designing our so our project now is you

431
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,279
have to choose a real world

432
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,399
>> system and emulate it.

433
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,880
>> That's what we're all working on.

434
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
>> Yeah.

435
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,079
>> And one of the big things like that

436
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
really helped us get started was like

437
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,720
what is the message we want to get

438
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,760
across? So we chose evolution was what

439
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
is it about evolution? Do you want to

440
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,399
say that it's random? Do you want to say

441
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,240
that as this? And how do we express

442
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,079
that? How we got into it.

443
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,160
>> Yeah. No, totally. And it gets even it

444
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
gets even crazier when you take when you

445
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,000
try to look at systems that are not

446
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,720
particularly tangible, right? So, you

447
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,560
know, um maybe you've looked at it, but

448
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,079
um you know uh Elude is a game about

449
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,399
depression, right? Like there there

450
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,760
there aren't exactly tangible kind of

451
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,760
road maps the way there are with like

452
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
FedEx systems for for clinical

453
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,720
depression, right? And yet yet if you're

454
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
looking at things like emotions,

455
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
feelings, um stuff like that that we

456
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,760
might we might call abstract or or um

457
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
just non- immediate um how do you how do

458
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,680
you uh how do you communicate those in

459
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
systems? Right. It's really tricky.

460
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,040
>> I find this is a tougher argument for

461
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,920
games which are like more games of

462
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,839
chance or more abstract

463
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,519
zoker art.

464
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
>> Yeah, I mean it's it's a really good

465
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
question.

466
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,279
>> What do you what do you say about that?

467
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,040
Yeah. I mean, and I think that falls

468
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,720
along the same lines as like, you know,

469
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,480
like like I said, I mean, does does

470
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,519
Ebert consider pornography art? I mean,

471
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
it's it's like a really difficult

472
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,040
question. And that's that's such a much

473
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
kind of a much larger kind of art

474
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
history debate, right? About like about

475
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,079
has high culture and low culture

476
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
completely collapsed? Has mass media

477
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,560
proliferation like deteriorated

478
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,480
conceptions of, you know, of what, you

479
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,600
know, really high culture art are versus

480
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,000
low culture? And and and I think that's

481
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,759
um I I don't have particularly good

482
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
answers for that. You know, I think just

483
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,199
as as all of the other media that we

484
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
look at, like does a Jerry Brookheimr

485
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,839
film count as art, right? Just like we

486
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
would look at that and ask that

487
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,720
question. Um, we don't then, you know,

488
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,800
deny the entire medium of film from from

489
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,160
the possibility of being artistic. Um

490
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,959
there seems to be this desire because

491
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,560
the majority of games in our sector um

492
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,920
which I actually completely disagree

493
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,199
with too because if you go far back

494
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,480
there they're most I should say video

495
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,240
games but um because most video games

496
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
are are kind of commercially intended

497
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,839
and involve you know fairly similar

498
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,519
themes right does that you know preclude

499
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,279
the medium from the possibility of being

500
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,360
artistic um you know and I go back to

501
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,519
that Eber kind of comment about like you

502
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
know he he he says they they they can't

503
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,519
possibly be or at least you know he says

504
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,440
never is a long time but not in our

505
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,880
lifetime apparently. Is it possible? So,

506
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
no, it's a good point. Good question.

507
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,279
>> So, there was actually an interesting uh

508
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
effects with us the game that we're

509
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,880
designing, which is essentially like

510
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,959
city building and city creation in in

511
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,959
the time of like the Roman Empire.

512
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,959
>> Uh, and we actually didn't intend to

513
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
like instill any meaning in the game,

514
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,759
but once we actually designed the

515
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,279
mechanics and stuff, we realized that it

516
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,280
was essentially a game about the rich

517
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,199
getting richer and trying to control the

518
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,880
poor. So, it's like there's almost this

519
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,160
like inherent meaning that came out from

520
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,919
just designing the game.

521
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,760
>> Yeah. Yeah. And you almost can't help,

522
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,199
right, but but have it happen in some

523
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,520
instances. It reminds me of a good thing

524
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,880
of um that uh Brenda Brathweight put in

525
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,280
one of her talks once which was about

526
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
the game uh civilization the the mod

527
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,559
colonization for Civ 4 which is a great

528
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,400
mod in which you play one of the

529
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,880
European colonizers and you come over to

530
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,480
the new world and um you know there's uh

531
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,840
there's indigenous peoples there and you

532
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,600
have to kind of negotiate with them at

533
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
first but eventually they just kind of

534
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
um you either beat them up and take

535
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,520
their land or they just give it to you

536
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,039
because you're more powerful than they

537
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,320
are. She was making the point, you know,

538
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,679
there's this great box art with like the

539
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
Native Americans in the corners and like

540
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,720
the concistador in the middle, you know,

541
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,240
the Spanish and the Dutch. And it's

542
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
like, if you were a Native American, how

543
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,520
would you respond to this game, right? I

544
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,200
mean, it's like I'm like, "Yeah, I'm I'm

545
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,480
totally making America again, you know,

546
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,160
and other people would be like, "Oh my

547
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
god, you basically just, you know, wiped

548
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,640
out my ancestors. Thanks." Um, so it it

549
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
it's true. I mean, you kind of sometimes

550
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,440
you fall into meaning. It's it's

551
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,520
something that does. And I think, you

552
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,880
know, again, a lot of art does that,

553
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
right? And some art did it quite

554
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
purposely. um you know where they

555
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,600
weren't divulging the meaning they were

556
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
inviting readings of it. Um so Fluxus

557
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,480
Fluxus is this um this really

558
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,320
interesting uh mid- 20th century art uh

559
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,039
they they rejected the term movement.

560
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,280
They called it an attitude. Um that Mary

561
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,720
Flame talks about a bit in her in her

562
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,880
critical playbook and it's actually

563
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
quite interesting. It's it really starts

564
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,600
out early with with John Cage. Have you

565
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,679
guys heard of him? The composer. Um he's

566
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
most famous for this piece of music that

567
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,200
he wrote where I forget the duration.

568
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,000
It's like 633.

569
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,880
>> It's four 4 minutes and 33 seconds of

570
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
not well like not playing. Right. Like

571
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
Yeah. He rests. Exactly. So you'd sit

572
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
down at the piano and you'd pull out the

573
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,919
music and everyone would hush and then

574
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,760
for 4 minutes and 33 seconds you'd sit

575
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,919
there possibly with your hands on the

576
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,280
keys and then after the time you would

577
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,840
stand up, you'd take your bow and the

578
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,799
audience would erupt into you know

579
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,720
incredible applause. Um but he was

580
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,240
really kind of testing the idea of what

581
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,320
they what they eventually kind of called

582
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,039
scores or event scores, right? This idea

583
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,440
that like music um music is an art form

584
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,200
where you can kind of uh write it down

585
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,280
and then it becomes performable, right?

586
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
it becomes this kind of thing um that

587
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,440
someone can engage with and and um we

588
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,039
don't think of paintings that way. We

589
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
don't think of paintings as having a

590
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,559
score, having some kind of you know how

591
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,559
do I engage with this, right? It sounds

592
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,480
kind of like games. They're they're you

593
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,160
know figuring out how does interactivity

594
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,720
work in artistic mediums? Um really

595
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,720
interested in indeterminacy too. Um I

596
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,320
mean I think you'll see in some of these

597
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
examples that they're they're really

598
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,960
kind of pushing on the boundaries of

599
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
what um of what what art has been doing

600
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
to this point. Uh they call it

601
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,080
intermedia uh meaning that the more kind

602
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,200
of um multiple modes that you can use

603
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,600
for for communicating it. Um was really

604
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,520
important to the to the attitude. Um

605
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,520
simplicity was really big right having

606
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,440
you know having kind of basic basic

607
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,000
systems and and basic kind of scores.

608
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,960
And then this idea of play um was really

609
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,320
kind of important. Um Yoko Ono, it's

610
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,160
funny, you know, we sort of just

611
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,919
attached her to John Lennin, but she she

612
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,919
was an artist before she was um you

613
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,919
know, just in a relationship with him,

614
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
and she's actually kind of well known as

615
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,520
one of these kind of Fluxus

616
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,120
practitioners. Um this is interesting.

617
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,559
This is the Fluxus manifesto. Um I kind

618
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,840
of wanted to just put this up because I

619
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,200
think you can get a little bit of a

620
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,159
sense for what they were trying to go

621
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,559
for. So um you know they were taking the

622
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
word fluxus and or flux and you know

623
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,360
putting the definition but then they

624
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
were kind of amending it here. So you

625
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,919
know purge the world of bourgeoa

626
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,080
sickness uh intellectual professional

627
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,080
and commercialized culture. Purge the

628
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,159
world of dead art, imitation, artificial

629
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
art, abstract art, illusionistic art,

630
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,080
mathematical art. I like this. Purge the

631
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,880
world of Europeanism.

632
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,799
Don't even know if that's a word. Um

633
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,000
>> yeah. Promote a revolutionary flood and

634
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,840
tide in art. um promoting art, anti-art,

635
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
non-art reality. I mean, these things

636
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,000
these things sound like totally crazy,

637
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,840
right? I love the I love the to be fully

638
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,679
grasped, but then it crosses out fully,

639
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,039
right? And and that I don't doubt that

640
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,080
that was completely intentional. Or if

641
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,200
they wrote fully grass, we're like, "Oh,

642
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,320
this is going to be great, right? I'm

643
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,679
crossing out so you can see that I

644
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,840
crossed out fully grasped." We want it

645
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,520
to be not fully grasped, you know? We

646
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,559
want to be partially grasped by all

647
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,120
people. Um not only critics, um talks

648
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,559
and professionals. So, um and it's just

649
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,159
a really interesting thing. And this

650
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,280
sort of like screams kind of the avant

651
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,559
guard, right? They were trying to like

652
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,159
push against boundaries. They're trying

653
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,080
to figure out what is the edge of the

654
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,320
medium and then how can we how can we

655
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,480
just like, you know, jump way off it.

656
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,640
And um

657
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,559
some of the classic fluxist works were

658
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,720
these things called flux boxes or flux

659
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,919
kits. Um and flux kits tended to have

660
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,000
event scores. This is one of the most

661
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,679
famous called Water Yam by George Breck.

662
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,559
Um and basically this is a box with 70

663
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,159
event scores. Um, and these are an

664
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,600
example of kind of event scores. And and

665
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
it's interesting. I mean, event scores

666
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,400
really seem like rule systems, right?

667
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,480
Like they're like the instructions to

668
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,919
your board game. Um, except they're

669
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
they're kind of wacky. I mean, if you

670
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,360
look at you look at air conditioning,

671
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,840
um, the the rule is move through the

672
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
place. Um, which is really interesting.

673
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
I mean, if you encounter this game and

674
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
you're like, "All right, I'm going to

675
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
play water jam." And then you pull out

676
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,159
air conditioning, you're like, "Move

677
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,600
through the place." Um, and I think

678
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,200
that's kind of, you know, pretty

679
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,799
characteristic of the movement, right?

680
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
present you with some sort of objective

681
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,600
or some sort of um some sort of

682
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,159
requirement, but one that is kind of uh

683
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,000
abstract or nebulous or just, you know,

684
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,480
kind of strange. This one's even better.

685
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,360
Um on a white chair, a great tape

686
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,520
measure, alphabet, flag, black, and

687
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,799
spectral colors. Um in this instance,

688
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,159
it's not even clear what you're

689
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,679
necessarily supposed to do. Are you

690
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,440
supposed to compile these things on a

691
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,960
white chair? Um you know, are you

692
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
supposed to sit on a white chair and

693
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,679
hold all of these things? Um it's not

694
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,760
it's not particularly clear. And um and

695
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,280
this is this is you know this is the

696
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,919
playfulness of this movement. This is

697
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,919
kind of the the energy of this kind of

698
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,760
uh avantgard movement. Um

699
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,360
you can see kind of the relationship I I

700
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,200
hope between kind of rule systems and

701
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,799
these the next example is I think

702
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
another one but but you can see how

703
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,679
they're kind of playing around with

704
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,200
these ideas. At least they're

705
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,799
incorporating interactivity into these

706
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,559
art pieces, right? And keep in mind

707
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,640
these are these are being shown in

708
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,960
galleries. These are being shown in high

709
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,440
art places, right? These are um being

710
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,200
sent out to their friends as as works of

711
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,080
of art. Um this one's great. Um this is

712
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,080
white chess by Yokoono and and it's

713
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,000
often kind of depicted on its own and

714
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
you have to imagine what the rules are,

715
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,039
but I actually think her rules as they

716
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,480
are written are actually pretty

717
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
important to it. So she says, "Play it

718
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,799
for as long as you can remember who is

719
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,679
your opponent and who is your own self."

720
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,039
Um very interesting wordage, but um so

721
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
what are the comp what are the

722
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,640
complications with white chess? Anyone?

723
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,679
Any thoughts based on your perceptions

724
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,320
of nonwhite chess or white and black

725
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,120
chess?

726
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,000
>> Yeah. Begin to argue, but that was my

727
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000
pawn.

728
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,520
>> Yes. Yes. You definitely will be hard to

729
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,120
keep track of, I would think. Yeah. I

730
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,039
mean, that's why she said as long as you

731
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,799
can remember. Any other um any other

732
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,320
kind of weirdness from this?

733
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,760
>> Who is friend and who enemy?

734
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
>> Yeah. I mean, certainly, right? I mean,

735
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,559
this is sort of like, wait, was that my

736
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,080
piece? Was that your piece? Not only

737
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,480
does that complicate your relationship

738
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,919
to the other player, right? But but now

739
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,480
it's like to the game itself, it's like,

740
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
wait, what was the strategy I was doing?

741
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
>> Friendly fire.

742
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,440
>> Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to keep

743
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,480
track of stuff in chess. What about the

744
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,919
board?

745
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,080
>> You might swap the king and the queen by

746
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,400
mistake because you don't have

747
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,720
>> there's not really any like actual boxes

748
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,720
on the board.

749
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,400
>> Yeah, they're all they're all white,

750
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,159
right? So, I mean, that sort of

751
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,200
complicates things a little bit too,

752
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,360
right? Because you need to kind of

753
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
remember how you were moving. This one's

754
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,200
really big. This is like a garden

755
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,400
installment of of white chess. And I

756
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,840
think the cool thing too, I mean this is

757
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,320
another example of kind of the movement,

758
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,840
right? Um, as long as you have the

759
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,200
components, you could play this game.

760
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,320
You could create this art piece. I think

761
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,320
for Yokoa, the sense is not go play my

762
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,400
installation of white chess. It's that

763
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,159
this is the rules. These are the pieces.

764
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,520
It can be played. And that screams game,

765
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,400
right? I mean, that that that screams

766
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,159
that kind of portability of a game. Um,

767
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
and but again, you know, this was this

768
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,919
wasn't considered anything but art

769
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
except probably by people who, you know,

770
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,640
turned their nose at this sort of thing

771
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,640
anyway. stuff. Um

772
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,039
any thoughts on um any thoughts on what

773
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,840
what white chess could be uh you know

774
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:27,039
kind of about in a in a

775
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,559
>> two different sides between one and

776
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,279
>> to

777
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,360
eventually get why am I fighting? Why

778
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,880
who is my enemy in this situation?

779
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
>> Sure. Sure. Any other thoughts?

780
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,720
>> Yeah.

781
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,200
>> Racial relations.

782
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,200
>> Sure. Racial relations. I mean, there's

783
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,480
probably like a whole anti-war thing of

784
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,679
like, you know, are we actually

785
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,120
destroying ourselves?

786
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
>> Yeah. And and I mean, that's so that's

787
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,039
an interesting thing. Yokoono was a

788
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,480
decidedly um a decidedly kind of

789
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,000
anti-war activist in the time that she

790
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,840
was making this in the early 60s. I

791
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
mean, one thing that you can't take

792
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
anything for granted. The pieces aren't

793
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
all black, right? They're they're all

794
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
white. So, I think the race thing does

795
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,400
kind of play a factor. The inability to

796
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,880
remember who you're attacking and and

797
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,320
who who you are even. And I think that's

798
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,760
actually why I really like her words

799
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,200
because for as long as you can remember

800
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,240
who is your opponent and who is your own

801
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,080
self. There's something about

802
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
incorporating your own self in there.

803
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,760
Not just saying who you know what your

804
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,120
pieces are, right? She's not saying can

805
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
you remember what your pieces are. She's

806
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,200
saying you know remember who you're

807
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,360
playing against versus who you are. Um

808
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,240
that's very different verbiage. Um and

809
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,799
so it's it's it's I I think it's very

810
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,880
much a game about about who are you

811
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,080
fighting anyway? Um you know what is the

812
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,120
point of war? What is the purpose of

813
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,520
war? Um and how how does war

814
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,360
particularly function? Um, and in the

815
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,720
rhetoric of the time it it makes a lot

816
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,919
of sense, right? Um, so that's Yoko's

817
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,919
white chess, which is which is part of

818
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
the Flexus movement. Yeah, it's it's

819
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,279
pretty it's pretty cool. And actually,

820
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,799
Fluxus and and artists in this period

821
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,080
have a really interesting relationship

822
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,159
with chess. There's like some quote, and

823
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,679
I'm going to butcher it, but it was um I

824
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,240
think it was Marcel Duchamp saying that

825
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,000
not um not all chess players are

826
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,279
artists, but all artists are chess

827
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,640
players or something like that. he was

828
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,200
particularly fascinated with chess and

829
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,159
and you could see elements of chess in

830
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,919
his um in his work, you know, either

831
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,799
being, you know, painted or whatever.

832
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
And so

833
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,720
>> he was completely obsessed with chess.

834
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,480
He he was a he was he played it really

835
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
hard. He wasn't necessarily a very good

836
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,799
player, but he played it a lot.

837
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,640
>> Very into it. Um, so now I'm going to

838
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,760
kind of move out of this sort of Plexus

839
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
move and I just wanted to show you a

840
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,039
couple examples, but I think this next

841
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,480
one is actually sort of an interesting

842
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,480
this is a current game that I'm really

843
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,360
excited about, which is called um 16

844
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
Tons. Um, and this is a game I

845
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
unfortunately have not been able to play

846
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,600
yet, but I've I've witnessed play

847
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
because it's it's a game for four

848
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,799
players, but this was created by Eric

849
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,240
Zimmerman and Natalie Py. And it's um so

850
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,279
it's a really interesting game. It's a

851
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
little hard to see from these pictures,

852
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,240
but it's this giant circle, I would say,

853
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,799
almost the size of this room of

854
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,320
corrugated cardboard. Maybe even bigger,

855
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,799
a little bit bigger than this room. But,

856
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,760
um, inside you've got this kind of array

857
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,600
of colored um array of colored circles

858
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,600
in these pretty hefty steel uh steel

859
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,120
tubes that have color. Um, and let's

860
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
like let's go through the rules. I mean,

861
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,039
the first thing to notice is that they

862
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,520
they contextualize the title 16 tons

863
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,960
with a quote from the from the song. Um,

864
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,559
you load 16 tons and what do you get?

865
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
another day older and deeper in debt.

866
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
Um, so this is doing an interesting

867
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,360
thing that that actually, you know, John

868
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,720
Sharp, who you can actually see in the

869
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,880
middle, thinks is actually particularly

870
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
important for for games and games that

871
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
are kind of working in this art

872
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,679
movement, is that they declare their

873
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,600
intentionality. Um, whether they declare

874
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,440
what what their meaning is or not is

875
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,039
less important, but they to be taken

876
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,320
seriously, you need to take yourself

877
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,039
seriously, I think, was one of the

878
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,320
things he said. And and I think um, you

879
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,760
know, this is another great example. We

880
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,520
can talk about how other games maybe in

881
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,159
the digital space do this, but right now

882
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,559
they're already kind of priming you for

883
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
reading the rules in a way that is

884
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,360
different than just oo let's play,

885
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,360
right? I mean, could you imagine if

886
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,120
Monopoly had some sort of um you know,

887
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,080
like Marxist quote in the front of it or

888
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,679
something like that, right? Your

889
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,159
experience of it would be completely

890
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,080
different. So, um you set up, you put

891
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,520
the pieces kind of in this array. Um you

892
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,279
stand on a number and that indicates

893
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,760
what color you are. And this is great.

894
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,039
You take out $3. Although you can see in

895
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,520
uh in this second picture, they're

896
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,960
playing um what uh what Eric, the

897
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,760
designer, has deemed high stakes uh 16

898
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,000
times where you pull out three $5 bills.

899
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,600
Um and so it says how to win. You win

900
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,520
when the two pieces of your color are

901
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,279
directly adjacent to each other. Um so

902
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,120
diagonally adjacent does not count for a

903
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,720
win. The way you play is players take

904
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,000
turns starting with player one. When

905
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919
it's your turn, you say, "Put me to

906
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,080
work." Uh players may then offer to pay

907
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,120
you one or more dollars in any order. So

908
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
anyone can just say, "I'll give you

909
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,440
this." um you have to accept the highest

910
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,360
payment except if there's a tie, right?

911
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,880
Because with, you know, with specific

912
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,200
denominations there's very likely to be

913
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,399
a tie. Then you get to choose which of

914
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,240
the highest biders um you can take and

915
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,360
the the person who pays then tells you

916
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,960
what move to make. Um and if no one

917
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,799
offers to pay you, you get to decide

918
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,880
what to do. Um and then it's the next

919
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,000
player's turn and you continue until one

920
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
player wins. Um,

921
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
just off the top of your heads, having

922
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,399
not even played it, um, it's tough to

923
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,760
critique games when you haven't played,

924
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,520
but just looking at the rules and

925
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,440
hearing about it and even kind of I love

926
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,279
that picture on the left because it it

927
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,200
embodies some of the kind of spirit of

928
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,480
the play, too. But, um, what are some

929
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,279
interesting things about this rule set

930
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,039
that you notice?

931
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,679
>> You play with money, but you don't win

932
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,600
money.

933
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,080
>> Well, that's an interesting question.

934
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,720
Uh, what happens to the money at the end

935
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,919
of the game? Who knows? Do you keep it?

936
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,240
That's unclear.

937
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,520
>> Very, very unclear. And that's one of

938
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,600
the things that's really great about

939
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,000
this game, right? Is that that it puts

940
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,440
you into these social situations where

941
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
now you're playing with real currency

942
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
that was your own. And now it's like,

943
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,360
well, what what happens to this, right?

944
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,960
And and so it says you win if your

945
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,720
piece, but maybe you you feel like you

946
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,840
win if you move the most pieces and you

947
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,960
have the most money at the end of the

948
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,919
game, right? I mean, you've got this

949
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,559
kind of weird economy in here. Um, and I

950
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,159
think the fact that it's not explicit um

951
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,679
in this rule set is great, right? Right.

952
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,279
I mean, that's that's what creates this

953
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,880
sort of potential for kind of an

954
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,640
interesting social dynamic. Other things

955
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,000
that are interesting about this game, if

956
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,559
you're the only person who has money,

957
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,919
then you basically you can basically win

958
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,440
if you're the only person who has money.

959
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,760
Yeah. So, it does require a little bit

960
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,399
of strategy, too. Um,

961
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,240
>> technically from this that setup, could

962
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,320
you win on the first turn? Because it

963
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,720
seems you only have do you have two only

964
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,880
two pieces of a certain color?

965
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,760
>> Yeah, but up on the right assume the

966
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
starting position.

967
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,120
>> Yeah, I know. And so you so on your turn

968
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,039
you could take one p your piece and and

969
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,840
have it be moved to the square right

970
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,799
next to yours.

971
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,039
>> No move to any Oh. Oh, you have to move

972
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,360
it.

973
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,120
>> Read the red.

974
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,120
>> Oh, any adjacent note. Okay.

975
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,320
>> I didn't read the adjacent adjacent

976
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,760
empty square. Um

977
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,440
>> that's actually really interesting.

978
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,159
>> Yeah, it's a really weird I mean there I

979
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,480
think the I also think the the you're

980
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,120
you're not you're the agency you have in

981
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,880
the game to to win is not by moving your

982
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,480
own pieces. It's by paying someone to do

983
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,679
the work for you, right? And so then we

984
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,120
kind of get back to this quote at the

985
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,559
beginning of the ego is 16 tons and what

986
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
do you get another day in deeper debt?

987
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,519
It's like what what is this game about?

988
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,600
I mean, it could be about a lot of

989
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,799
things. And I mean, we we we honestly

990
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,679
probably shouldn't dissect it until

991
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,720
we've played it. Um I think too the kind

992
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,240
of corrugated cardboard, it gets hot

993
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,519
inside of there if you're not outside.

994
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,120
And that's a really interesting thing

995
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,000
too, right? like you're in there, it's

996
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,200
hot, it's sweaty, you've got dirty money

997
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,440
in your hands, you're moving around

998
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,799
these fair, you know, sizable, they have

999
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,760
weight to them. That was really

1000
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,200
important, too, right? I mean, this

1001
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,799
could have been played around a table

1002
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,080
with, you know, go pieces or something,

1003
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,600
you know, painted go pieces, but these

1004
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,200
are like, you know, these are

1005
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,159
substantial steel pieces that you've got

1006
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,840
to pick up and move. Um, and, you know,

1007
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,720
obviously the well, the song was about

1008
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,240
kind of manual labor. Um,

1009
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,679
so this is a really interesting game.

1010
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,120
This was this was released at the art

1011
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,880
history of games conference last year

1012
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,200
and it did well at indicate this year it

1013
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,200
won the uh developers choice award. Um

1014
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,799
and it's it's it's really cool. I want

1015
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
to try to get it up to MIT so that we

1016
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,600
can all play it.

1017
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,279
>> It occurs to me that you could if you

1018
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,960
play by rules where you keep the money

1019
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,399
you get at the end of the game. You

1020
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
basically could throw the game to get

1021
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,279
all the money.

1022
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,480
>> Yeah. I mean you could try you could try

1023
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,600
right but but you know people are going

1024
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,960
to know what you're doing you know and

1025
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,679
people are going to see your strategy.

1026
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
So it's it's

1027
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,080
>> not going to pay you Jack.

1028
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,080
>> Yeah. Yeah, I mean the multiplayer gets

1029
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,559
the multi multiplayer the you know the

1030
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,559
game gets in this. Um so I mean again

1031
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,799
like just kind of cycling back to what

1032
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,039
we're talking about. I mean is this art

1033
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,240
you know it would be hard for me to call

1034
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,919
it much of anything else. Um

1035
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,120
so this is like one of my one of my

1036
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,640
favorite games. Uh it's certainly my

1037
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,559
favorite Jason Norade. Who's played

1038
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,080
gravitation here? A couple of you. All

1039
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,200
right cool. And a bunch of you haven't.

1040
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,120
That's awesome. So I'll get one of you

1041
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,559
to play it. Um, one thing I want to

1042
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,159
point out with this, I mean, we can talk

1043
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,880
after someone's played Gravitation a

1044
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,919
little bit about um, uh, about, you

1045
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
know, what we think about the game

1046
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,480
itself, but but I think this quote is

1047
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,320
interesting. You know, he has artist

1048
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,399
statements with all of his games. Um,

1049
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,000
some of them say more, some of them say

1050
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,919
less. This one responded because this

1051
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
was after Passage was released, and I

1052
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,039
think you guys have all seen Passage,

1053
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,640
right? And you can you can immediately

1054
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,080
identify the aesthetic similarities

1055
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,799
because the character is exactly the

1056
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,720
same. Um, and he was responding to

1057
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,760
criticism from people about his pixel

1058
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,599
art and why did he go for pixel art? Um,

1059
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,119
but he says, "I now see ultra- lowres

1060
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,200
pixel art as a kind of digital

1061
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,320
cartooning. It stands right on the line

1062
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,919
between the symbolic and the

1063
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,919
representational, leaving plenty of room

1064
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,440
for viewer interpretation. Why draw

1065
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,359
sideburns when the viewers can imagine

1066
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,399
sideburns on their own? You just need to

1067
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,839
give them something to pin their

1068
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,839
imagination on, something to guide them

1069
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,280
a bit. Cartoons are perfect for that."

1070
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,440
And and I think that's a really

1071
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,520
interesting point. And I think what he's

1072
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,760
what he's also suggesting here, which is

1073
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,679
maybe not clear, is that this is doing a

1074
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,000
similar thing to what that quote from

1075
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,599
the music does. It's priming your

1076
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,359
experience of the play. Right? You load

1077
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,200
up this game, you see that it's got this

1078
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,520
low res pixel art that we now associate

1079
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,200
with this kind of art, game movement,

1080
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,359
and you're ready to read this in another

1081
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,280
way. Um, if I gave you a firsterson

1082
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,480
shooter, um, and told you nothing about

1083
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,079
it except that it was going to be the

1084
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,520
fastest, awesomest multiplayer

1085
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,880
first-person shooter experience, but it

1086
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,160
looked like this. Um,

1087
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,160
you know, would you be inclined to read

1088
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,079
it like an art game? I mean, I I don't

1089
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,280
know. Um, but but certainly in this

1090
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,880
instance with these kind of little

1091
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,720
games, right, this this sort of pixel

1092
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,839
art aesthetic um that you see being

1093
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,000
duplicated in a lot of places is is sort

1094
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,000
of um I don't know, priming the pump.

1095
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,560
It's it's establishing some sort of

1096
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,040
context in which you can read this game.

1097
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,760
Um, so who wants to play uh gravitation?

1098
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,160
Actually, let me Oops. No, that's not

1099
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,680
supposed to happen. I wanted to click on

1100
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,680
the link. Oh, because I clicked on my

1101
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,560
screen, not this screen. And all it does

1102
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,920
is take me out of here.

1103
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,280
>> Me not being mirrored might be a

1104
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,480
problem. Let's see.

1105
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,160
Let's see what screen this loads up on.

1106
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,960
Both one. Crap. Okay, hold on one sec. I

1107
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,960
got to mirror my screen.

1108
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,839
Um, I I should not be choosing who plays

1109
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,880
who wants to. Uh, I can't make a choice.

1110
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,720
Who wants to do it?

1111
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,040
>> Interesting that it's a version zero.

1112
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,040
>> Yes.

1113
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,320
>> I have to explicitly make that the case.

1114
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,320
>> Uh,

1115
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
>> anybody. It's It's free. It's free to

1116
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
download. So, if you don't play it now,

1117
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,920
you can play it on your own.

1118
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,079
>> We have a few games, right? So, what's

1119
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,280
that?

1120
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,560
>> We have a few games, right? So,

1121
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,320
>> Oh, yeah. We have a few. So, yeah.

Getting a few different opportunities to

1123
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,280
play. So, anybody jump over and and like

1124
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,800
>> we'll start with Jason and then we'll do

1125
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,000
kind of jumping into

Gravitation as you play it, you know,

1129
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,490
like like let's play the

1133
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
and it's falling.

1134

>> Oh, never mind.

1138
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,839
She stole your ball. Oh, she plays with

1139
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,079
you. She stole it.

1140
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,599
>> I hate her. I stole her ball.

1141
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,800
>> She seemed to like you, but she stole it

1142
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,839
for a little bit, but now she seems to

1143
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
be playing, which is better.

1144
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,480
>> Yes. Hurry up.

successfully do so. And it's getting

1148
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:09,760
brighter than earlier.

1149

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,800
>> Really confused.

>> Or wall jump.

1171
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,000
ball.

1172
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,160
>> Oh, you can jump higher when she size of

1173
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,040
the screen dictates how high you can

1174
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,280
jump.

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
doesn't get cold.

>> Oh, it's blocking the um

>> There's fire though.

All right, go push. Start with

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,680
warming up in the furnace. So, the

1252
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,599
warmer the world is less points you get

1253
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,599
for the icing. Is this about global

1254
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,599
warming?

1255
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,040
>> Okay, so this

1256
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,640
>> I think it's about drugs. He gets love

1257
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,079
from this girl and then like I think

1258
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,510
make him happy, but only for a little

1259
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,720
bit.

>> What?

1263
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,440
>> Yeah.

at a much faster rate.

1280
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,680

1281
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,040
back down.

fire left.

1302
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,000
fire started warming you again.

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,319
>> Therapy.

1304
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,680
No.

1308
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,440
go.

1309
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,280
>> Maybe she only comes in the spring.

1310
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,560
Maybe winter's too cold. So maybe if I

1311
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,040
wait by the fire.

1312
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,040
>> Does it go faster?

1313
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,599
>> Yeah. What? Why is it getting bigger?

1314
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,920
>> Cuz he's by the fire. It's getting

1315
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,560
warmer. But that wasn't working earlier.

1316
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,440
>> Now it is.

1317
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,839
>> Go faster.

1318
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,000
>> He's a rock bottom. It's like spring.

1319
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,599
>> But

1320
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,160
she How high can you jump right now?

1321
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,200
>> Can you hit the ball?

1322
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,440
>> Pretty high. That's a lot of jumps.

1323
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,560
>> No, I can't hit the ball.

1324
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,079
>> Only she can lift the ball.

1325
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,480
>> Well, while you're increasing, you

1326
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,960
should probably go up and get the stars.

1327
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,960
>> Go up. Go up.

1328
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,920
>> There we go.

1329
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,200
>> Stop expanding.

1330
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,640
>> Isn't it Is it the stars?

1331
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,640
>> Stop contracting, too.

1332
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,040
>> Oh, you're even on fire now.

1333
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,480
>> He's on fire.

1334
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,480
>> Can you go infinitely high if you're on

1335
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,480
fire?

1336
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,560
>> Pretty darn high. That was like pretty.

1337
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,520
Uhoh.

1338
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,079
>> Four stars.

1339
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,960
>> Are you getting all of them? Oh, I Oh,

1340
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,560
>> that might have been a bit of an

1341
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
overdose.

1342
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,119
>> No.

1343
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,560
>> Yeah, you totally ODed on stars just

1344
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,920
there

1345
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,319
>> cuz you can always get stars as you go

1346
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,000
back.

1347
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,280
>> Or you can only hold four and then it

1348
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,680
retracts when you get four and then it

1349
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,720
turns ice blocks.

1350
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,119
>> What?

1351
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,119
>> That was intense.

1352
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,200
>> They're worth so much.

1353
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,280
Wait,

1354
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,280
>> and

1355
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,280
when

1356
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,160
>> you won,

1357
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,400
>> y

1358
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,079
>> what you want is a good question.

1359
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,280
>> That's gravitation. And actually, I

1360
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,040
mean, I'm not even kidding. That's

1361
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,319
that's certainly my favorite Jason game.

1362
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,079
It's it's one of

1363
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,839
>> it's one of my favorite games. And and I

1364
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,319
think even just the example of you guys

1365
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,680
playing is great, right? because because

1366
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,040
you're just kind of shouting out all

1367
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,760
these different ideas for what it could

1368
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:58,400
be about. Um and um you know there's

1369
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,440
some clear intentionality in in in his

1370
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,960
uh in his design um with this game,

1371
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,400
right? In terms of the systems trying to

1372
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,599
communicate something that's other than

1373
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,640
just, you know, engagement um or or I

1374
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,520
don't know, God, fun. Um I was it fun?

1375
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,680
>> Yeah. Oh, all right. Cool. Um yeah,

1376
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,800
that's pretty good. Um thoughts on what

1377
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
it's about? I heard a couple people be

1378
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,440
like drugs.

1379
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,240
>> Definitely drugs.

1380
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,520
>> Definitely drugs.

1381
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,480
>> Tons of analogies. Yeah.

1382
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,760
>> Yeah. It's kind of like drugs.

1383
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,720
>> Well, look,

1384
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,000
>> love is a relationship versus like

1385
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,800
whatever you're trying to do, your

1386
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,839
career, your

1387
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,680
>> Yeah.

1388
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,000
>> Yeah. I actually I call this like in

1389
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,839
life.

1390
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,280
>> I think it's like the ultimate MIT game.

1391
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,800
Um if I uh if I uh told you that this

1392
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,400
was his daughter,

1393
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,960
>> um would it change your interpretations

1394
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,440
of of the game and what happened?

1395
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,400
>> Yeah. So, so, so now if you know that

1396
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,119
this is his daughter, what do you think

1397
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,079
it's about?

1398
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,880
>> His job,

1399
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,000
>> neglect,

1400
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,440
>> work, neglect, job versus family, right?

1401
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,280
You know, he kind of

1402
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,560
>> um he says he says explicitly like

1403
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,040
before you played that this is a game

1404
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,560
about motivation. Um and he doesn't go

1405
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,240
doesn't go too far into telling you what

1406
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,280
the game is specifically about. And I

1407
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,640
think playing through it a couple times,

1408
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,599
but I mean I will tell you the first

1409
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,760
time I played and I came back out and

1410
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,440
she was gone, it was very upsetting for

1411
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,920
me. I was like, you know, and I don't

1412
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,000
know if it's just, you know, just, you

1413
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,160
know, I was, you know, ready to play it

1414
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,680
that way or my life stage or something

1415
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,960
like that. But the the idea of, you

1416
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,800
know, he's he's playing with his

1417
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
daughter that inspires him. You know, he

1418
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,960
travels and then, you know, one of these

1419
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,160
days if you're gone too long, she grows

1420
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,079
up. I mean, I don't know if she dies,

1421
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,520
but but you know,

1422
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,119
>> you didn't bring her any money,

1423
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,880
>> right? She cuz she had no money. Yeah,

1424
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,440
>> she died.

1425
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,440
>> So, I think this is a really really game

1426
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,560
and a game about motivation.

1427
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,680
>> It is. Yeah. or she wish she owed you on

1428
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,359
drugs.

1429
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,040
>> So, it's free. If you just Google search

1430
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,480
gravitation Jason, you'll you'll find

1431
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,920
the links to it. You'll find his artist

1432
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,839
statement, which I think is really kind

1433
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,119
of good to read. Um, again, with John

1434
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,400
Sharp's kind of point about like, you

1435
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,160
know, declaring your intentionality,

1436
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,280
whether you say what the game's about is

1437
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,520
important. Um, again, I I think I think

1438
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,000
this qualifies, at least for me, as art.

1439
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,680
Um, it's doing things that that I see

1440
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,440
other pieces of art doing. Um, okay. So,

1441
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,400
Paulo Percini, how many of your time?

1442
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,079
Um, uh, Paulo Percini is is one of my

1443
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,400
favorite game designers right now, and

1444
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,920
this this game actually is is is one of

1445
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,000
his newest ones, and I think it's I

1446
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,440
think it's hilarious and great. Um, and

1447
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,280
it's called Memory Reloaded: The

1448
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,640
Downfall. Test your concentration with

1449
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,560
Memory Reloaded, a matching game for

1450
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,480
these unstable times. History may be

1451
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,920
different from that which you remember.

1452
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,359
And who would like to play Memory

1453
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,640
Reloaded? I'm laughing already because

1454
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,400
it's funny. Has anybody played it? I

1455
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,599
need someone who's not played it. Okay,

1456
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,920

course, you can get different outcomes,

1521
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,119
some of Mullet Mysteria's other work

1522
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,640
that you guys saw every day the same

1523
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,880
dream. I like that

1524
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,400
>> which is interesting. Um yeah, that that

1525
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,040
one's that one's also one of my favorite

1526
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,599
games. Um but this is, you know, this is

1527
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,920
kind of uh this is this is kind of

1528
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,520
looking at another kind of sector of

1529
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,200
art, right? The kind of activist

1530
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,559
political statement sector of art and

1531
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,040
doing that through games and and it's

1532
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,839
something that this music

1533
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,520
um something that um that he does

1534
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,839
particularly well with his games and I

1535
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,720
think this one's this one's particularly

1536
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:05,920
um interesting and kind of funny. I love

1537
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,000
I love the um

1538
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,440
the kind of reworking of a really

1539
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,599
classic game mechanic, right? Like

1540
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,040
memory the the entire point of memory is

1541
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,520
your expectation that they would be the

1542
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,960
same the second time you turn it over.

1543
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,599
And when it changes on you, it

1544
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,359
reinforces that kind of uh that kind of

1545
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,960
perspective uh I suppose imbalance um

1546
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,800
that can exist when you're not just

1547
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,119
turning over, you know, toad stools and

1548
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,200
and Bowsers, but you know, actual kind

1549
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,839
of interesting things. I really I love

1550
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,400
the the crying sweating polar bear um

1551
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,720
and and the well with like a beach chair

1552
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,839
actually cracks me down. Um and I think

1553
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,800
humor is actually something that

1554
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,920
shouldn't be ignored here, right? I

1555
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,440
mean, if we remember that was one of the

1556
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,000
kind of the central flux things, this

1557
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,440
idea of like satire, humor is important.

1558
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,839
Um and so, uh I really I I think

1559
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,960
Paulini's work is really awesome. And

1560
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:58,160
again, I for me it's certainly arc

1561
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,680
enough. Um this game is really cool. Uh

1562
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,119
who's played love? We have a few people

1563
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,960
that's played Love. All right, cool. Um

1564
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,240
I'd love someone who has not played Love

1565
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,880
to to play it for a little bit. I don't

1566
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,480
know if we can play the whole game. Um,

1567
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,040
but uh this is actually a game that I I

1568
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,559
really don't like. Um but I like the

1569
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,640
things that it does, if that makes any

1570
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,119
sense. Like I it bothers me for some

1571
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,480
reason. Um and yet

1572
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,559
it's such an articulate statement. This

1573
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,839
game bothers me. Um but

1574
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,280

1575
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,359

1576
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,280

00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,920
>> Don't do it. Don't do it, dude.

1610
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,440
>> Do it.

1611
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,920
>> Do it.

1612
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,640
>> Do it.

1613
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,680
>> Do it.

1614
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,559
>> You're just going to have to go back to

1615
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,559
the part that was just hard.

1616
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,480
See,

1617
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,760
there's no red blocks. You get red

1618
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,480
blocks when you disobey.

1619
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,520
>> Yeah.

1620
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,240
You still can't touch

1621
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,240
the yellow card.

1622
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:36,119
>> So, if you disobey, it hides from you

1623
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,119
what things actually are

1624
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:49,200
>> or or if you obey, they're getting

[Music]

1626
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,400
It's so hard. So little buttons to

1627
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,559
press.

1628
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,240
>> Wait, what are the controls?

1629
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,960
>> The keys.

1630
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:06,880
>> Right, left.

1631
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:08,240
[Music]

1632
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,880
>> Should this have made

1633
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,319
>> What? Can you no longer jump?

1634
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,960
>> I was just screaming out.

1635
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,960
>> He's doing crouch. Crouch.

1636
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:24,669
[Music]

1637
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,119
risky. Oh, I thought that was bad.

[Music]

1639
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:41,680
>> Yeah, but that kind of looks like you.

1640
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,040
>> This game is well aggravatingly tuned

1641
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:48,040
because it's like just build it up.

1642
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,040
>> Uh

1643
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,359
uh

1644
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,359
>> crouch crouch.

1645
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,200
>> Why you doing that professionally? I

1646
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,200
just like

1647
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,400
>> So, it's actually a pretty long game. Um

1648
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,760
I I encourage you guys to uh it's pretty

1649
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,799
it's all flashbased.

1650
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,040
>> What's the message?

1651
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,200
>> Uh that's a really good question. Let me

1652
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,040
uh let me just jump in and go back.

1653
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,760
>> Thank you for playing.

1654
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,400
>> Thank you for playing.

1655
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,880
>> Disgusting.

1656
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,760
>> You are a changed person because of it.

1657
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,200
>> Disgusting.

1658
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,720
>> So yeah. So the question then becomes

1659
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,920
what the point which you know already

1660
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,359
we're in a position now where we're

1661
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,799
asking questions like that which is you

1662
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,240
know if you were playing Modern Warfare

1663
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,599
2 you might say what's the point like

1664
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,160
would be to blow a lot of stuff up

1665
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,000
right? So um this is

1666
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,200
>> this is a response he had in one of his

1667
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,319
interviews he gave after it was

1668
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,680
released. He said, "I wanted to get

1669
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,280
people to wake up and think about the

1670
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,559
games they are playing. Much of the

1671
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,839
industry appears to be pushing in the

1672
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,119
opposite direction. Essay long

1673
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,880
tutorials, holding your hand from

1674
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,799
beginning to end in subtext, screamed

1675
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,240
through pointless exposition. It is

1676
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,000
treating players like idiots is

1677
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,520
absolutely infuriating." Um, when you

1678
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,880
think about it in terms of a tutorial,

1679
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,720
right, if this is the tutorial for

1680
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,720
playing the game, it's pretty obnoxious.

1681
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,079
Um, but it's not that much different

1682
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,599
than the kind of tutorials that we

1683
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,119
encounter in a lot of games, right? That

1684
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,799
just basically hold your hand and tell

1685
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,720
you how to do everything. Um, so I think

1686
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,359
he's really kind of confronting that.

1687
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,680
Um, I guess if I were to say the reasons

1688
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:16,240
that I don't like this game, uh, I think

1689
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,440
the control scheme is is actually it's a

1690
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,640
weakness. The game is so hard that I

1691
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,079
mean, you saw like, you know, you

1692
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,119
couldn't even get to the things that he

1693
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,640
was trying to communicate. It gets

1694
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,400
weirder the farther along you get. I can

1695
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,920
I can promise you it's just it's like

1696
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,480
you have to get really skilled at doing

1697
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,559
it. Um, so there's there's kind of like

1698
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:38,880
a play barrier for entry on it. Um uh

1699
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,640
it's also it also for me I think

1700
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,400
dare I say it almost gets like too

1701
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,720
abstract for me at certain points um

1702
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,000
where I'm I'm it's clear that he's

1703
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,680
trying to say something but there's

1704
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,880
nothing I can latch on to to understand

1705
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,280
what it is and it's entirely his

1706
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,040
prerogative but for me that's I'm just

1707
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,480
like what like I have no clue what what

1708
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,960
this is about at all. Um so so that's a

1709
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,960
little tricky.

1710
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,520
>> He's not you are not fully grasping.

1711
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,720
>> I'm not apparently I'm not. Yeah. I'm

1712
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,160
partially. So yeah, it's like the

1713
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,520
perfect Fluxus piece of art. So um okay,

1714
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,119
so I've only got a couple more to talk

1715
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,400
about and I got about 15 minutes. This I

1716
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,839
think is actually one of the most

1717
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,200
important games that we can talk about

1718
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,960
today, which is Cow Clicker, who's

1719
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:19,440
played Cow Clicker. Yay. Um so this is

1720
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,920
um by Ian Bogos, the guy we saw earlier.

1721
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,160
Um and he said, "Cow Clicker is a

1722
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,079
Facebook game about Facebook games. It's

1723
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,599
partly a satire and partly a playable

1724
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,280
theory of today's social games and

1725
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,599
partly an earnest example of that

1726
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,599
genre." Um, so this is kind of like a

1727
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,880
classic sort of art thing to do, right?

1728
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,839
You take something that you're going to

1729
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,559
satire and you make a version of that

1730
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:42,240
that that maybe does some things

1731
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,839
differently, but is fundamentally what

1732
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,760
you are satiring. It's like the Andy

1733
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,799
Kaufman comedic kind of style, right?

1734
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,559
Where you like you just assume that that

1735
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,960
kind of character or role. And it's it's

1736
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,119
it's something that I think is like kind

1737
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,640
of like joyfully subversive um in in in

1738
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,319
doing satire. So hopefully I'm logged

1739
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,920
into Facebook so you can see and I

1740
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:06,839
haven't clicked recently so you guys can

1741
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,839
witness um one of my clicks. Am I

1742
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,359
>> Facebook is down? Facebook is canled

1743
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,359
forever.

1744
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,359
>> Yes.

1745
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,720
>> Has no friends.

1746
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,160
>> It's also possible that the wireless

1747
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,440
Yeah, the wireless in this in that

1748
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,880
corner is kind of bad.

1749
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,520
>> Oh, should I switch to Google?

1750
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,760
Oh.

1751
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,839
Um,

1752
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,040
so I can actually kind of before we even

1753
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,799
see it, I can talk a little bit about

1754
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,920
the sort of interesting controversy that

1755
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:45,119
Cal Clicker is is creating. Um, it's

1756
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:48,480
it's making money.

1757
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,200
>> MacBook Airs don't have Let me try

1758
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,599
Google.

1759
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
>> Yeah.

1760
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:55,680
>> Um,

1761
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:59,799
I'm not connected. How about now?

1762
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,799
It seems to be working better.

1763
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,319
>> Um, so the last part of his statement is

1764
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,559
about an earnest effort in a game. It it

1765
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,799
it is fundamentally a Facebook game. So

1766
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:14,000
you can see I've got um I've got five

1767
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,680
Mooney. Um my next click is in a minute

1768
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,280
and 40. Oh man, I missed one of my

1769
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,559
clicks. But maybe if I if we wait while

1770
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,960
I talk about it, you can witness one of

1771
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,960
my clicks. Um oh wait, I actually have

1772
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,480
some clicks left. I've got uh I've got,

1773
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,599
you know, one this week. But that's in

1774
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,040
two hours.

1775
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,559
>> Uh,

1776
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,880
>> yeah, it looks like that's when I get my

1777
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,760
next one. So, um, so basically you can

1778
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,319
click your cow,

1779
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:39,520
which

1780
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:41,359
why can I not click my cow?

1781
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,720
Um, well, you can click your cow and

1782
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,359
then you can Oh, it's because I'm on

1783
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,119
scrolling.

1784
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,319
I don't know. Um anyway, you can click

1785
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,680
your cow and then you can use your

1786
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:53,599
mooney uh to buy new cows um that are

1787
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,799
fundamentally the same thing as other

1788
01:01:53,599 --> 01:02:00,799
cows just with aesthetic differences. Um

1789
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:02,000
so plain cow. Um oh these are the cows I

1790
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,440
have. I have a plain cow and a steel

1791
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,599
cow. I haven't been playing a lot of cow

1792
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,119
clicker. Um if I go to buy a cow, I

1793
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:11,680
could buy a new cow. Um

1794
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,880
uh so you can see lots of different cows

1795
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,760
um that cost you in-game currency. Um,

1796
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,400
>> paisley cow.

1797
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,040
>> Yeah. Holy cow.

1798
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,920
Um, oil cow cow retire. Sad. It's got a

1799
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,079
BP logo. It's cute. Um,

1800
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,920
>> I like BSD cow. Yeah, that's pretty

1801
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,599
good. Um, so there's lots of different

1802
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,280
cows and you can buy cows. You can give

1803
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,960
cows. You can invite a cow. Um, there's

1804
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,079
cow rankings. Um,

1805
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,079
>> invite a cow.

1806
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,480
>> Uh, you can So you can see, you know,

1807
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,319
Mooney is actually pretty inflated at

1808
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,599
this point. You can get 10 Mooney for 50

1809
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,079
cents, which is pretty great. Thousand

1810
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,000
for $10, which is kind of awesome. um

1811
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,920
and you know collect a lot of cows and

1812
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,599
you can trade cows and you know you can

1813
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,160
go to your friends barns and see how

1814
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,640
many cows they have and um and you can

1815
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:57,119
click on your cows when you make make

1816
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,559
your appointment to actually cow. Um so

1817
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,400
I mean I think you can see how he's

1818
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,920
poking fun at um things like Farmville

1819
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,240
uh things like Ravenwood Fair which I'm

1820
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,920
obsessed with now actually. um these

1821
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,079
kind of games where all you're

1822
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,520
fundamentally doing is clicking uh and

1823
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,839
acquiring an in-game currency that you

1824
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,200
can then use for in-game goods. Um but

1825
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,319
then of course you reach this barrier

1826
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,440
where you don't have enough in-game

1827
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,400
currency and you need to use real

1828
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,079
currency. Of course, the interesting

1829
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,760
thing is like there are like I don't

1830
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,799
know 500,000 people playing this or I

1831
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,960
don't know if it's that many. It's a

1832
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:27,359
lot. Um here if we go to the cow clicker

1833
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,039
front page, right, it'll tell us oh Jera

1834
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:31,280
was at St. Barthol.

1835
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,880
>> Um where does it say how many players

1836
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,839
there are? ranking.

1837
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,680
>> Ranking. Yeah,

1838
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:41,119
>> I did that on board news.

1839
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:44,160
>> Who's milking the cow clicker?

1840
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,960
>> You can see this person's Monica's

1841
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,760
>> no count.

1842
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,440
>> Oh,

1843
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,039
>> um

1844
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,960
>> yeah, maybe all clicks or this week.

1845
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,039
>> Is there like a Oh,

1846
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,160
>> here we go. Yeah. Yeah.

1847
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,799
>> Um

1848
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,319
>> 12,000

1849
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,799
>> 12,000 monthly active users. Yes.

1850
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:02,079
500,000 a bit of a stretch, but um but

1851
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,359
that's a lot of people and he's making

1852
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,160
some interesting money on it. And I

1853
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,280
think one of the things that was

1854
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,799
important that he did is there's kind of

1855
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,880
an active forum where people can kind of

1856
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,559
talk about it and so it is a little bit

1857
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,319
weirdly controversial, right? Because he

1858
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,960
made this game that is, you know, poking

1859
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,240
fun at Facebook games and yet it is a

1860
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,559
Facebook game and it's, you know,

1861
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,880
presumably making some money, too. So,

1862
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,160
um but I think it's really good. I think

1863
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,760
it's, you know, this is the kind of art

1864
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,559
that's also important where it's like

1865
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,720
taking what we do and purposely looking

1866
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:31,280
at at at how is it constructed and how

1867
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,960
is it set up and and satiring it and

1868
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,160
forcing us to kind of be introspective

1869
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,720
about the things that we do in the way

1870
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,559
that we engage. Um, and so this is a

1871
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,000
kind of subversive game design that I

1872
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:43,440
think you know along the lines of Paulo

1873
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,200
Pedroini's work and um and even Galafa

1874
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,039
is kind of forcing us to look at how we

1875
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,319
interact. Um, and cow clicker cow

1876
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,000
clicker is really fun. Um uh so that's

1877
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,760
that one and I've got like 15 minutes.

1878
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,480
Philip asked me to talk a little bit

1879
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,359
about um some work that I'm doing in

1880
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,760
this space. Um so I'm going to talk to

1881
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,599
you about a game uh that I'm it's a work

1882
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,200
in progress. It's tenatively titled

1883
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:12,079
before and ends now. Um and it's by me.

1884
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:14,720
Um and the idea from it is it's inspired

1885
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:17,440
a bit by Flexus boxes. Um and those kind

1886
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,799
of flux kits. Um, I wanted to I'm really

1887
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,799
interested in in like physically

1888
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,559
tangible games. I don't know why I'm uh

1889
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:23,920
all of a sudden kind of obsessed with

1890
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,319
with holding something, but I was at

1891
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,920
indicate and I heard again and it this

1892
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:31,119
is like the question that drives me more

1893
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,880
nuts than than the um than the are video

1894
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,559
games art question, although they're

1895
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,079
interestingly related, but it's, you

1896
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,760
know, when will we have the citizen cane

1897
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,839
in video games? It drives me absolutely

1898
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,039
nuts. I think uh 80% of the time the

1899
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,440
people who say that have never seen

1900
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,760
citizen cane. Um so I don't really know

1901
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,440
what that means. Um, but I had heard it

1902
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,200
like for the eenth time in Indie Kane

1903
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,599
and I wanted to throw the television in

1904
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,880
my out of my hotel room window and I was

1905
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,960
like I was going nuts and I was like,

1906
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,720
"All right, well well what is Citizen

1907
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,240
Kane about?" And I don't want to spoil

1908
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,359
it. Who's seen Citizen Kane in this

1909
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,440
room? Actually, a handful of people. All

1910
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:03,839
right, good. Um,

1911
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,920
>> so so I, you know, I see Citizen Kane

1912
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,920
and it's about this very kind of, you

1913
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,720
know, interesting

1914
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:14,720
um idea about, you know, presence and

1915
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,160
and momentos and and happiness uh in a

1916
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,920
very kind of real way and like the

1917
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,680
temporality of happiness, right? Like

1918
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,200
are you happy now? Were you happy then?

1919
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,599
Do you remember being happy? When when

1920
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,039
is happiness? Um, and so I was like,

1921
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,480
well, I'm going to make a Citizen Cane

1922
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,960
of video games, but it's not going to be

1923
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,880
it's not going to be known for being uh

1924
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,280
uh epically innovative, you know, with

1925
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,039
camera movement. Um, it's it's going to

1926
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:39,200
be about the things I think Citizen Cane

1927
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:41,760
are about. Um, so it's it's basically um

1928
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,599
you know in this form uh although I'm

1929
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,359
I'm rethinking what kind of box it's

1930
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,160
going to be in but in this form it's a

1931
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:50,559
box and inside of it are various objects

1932
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,079
that start out as uh the starting

1933
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,240
objects for the box are things that have

1934
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,760
personal significance to me. Um and one

1935
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,680
of the rules of the game in fact I think

1936
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,200
the most important rule of the game uh

1937
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,880
is this one. Rule number one you may

1938
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,640
permanently exchange an object of

1939
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,400
personal significance for any object of

1940
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,520
equal value. So when you're playing this

1941
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,039
game, you can take something that

1942
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,839
belongs to you and you can exchange it

1943
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,200
for anything in the box. Um and then of

1944
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:14,559
course the interesting thing is these

1945
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,960
these um these objects in the box are of

1946
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,640
varying uh degrees of interactivity,

1947
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,000
right? Like you can do them in Etcha

1948
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,280
Sketch. So you can draw something on the

1949
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,039
Etcha sketch. Um and um you know the

1950
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,240
rules are kind of veiled in this moment

1951
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,760
now where there's like a couple other

1952
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,039
rules that you know are causing you to

1953
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,359
reflect. This is actually an extension

1954
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,799
of uh Yet One Word, which was a project

1955
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,799
we worked on in the summer, which was a

1956
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,240
game that um as you're playing, it's a

1957
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:38,400
platformer, and you're typing, the game

1958
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,920
stops and asks you personal questions.

1959
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,039
And what I really liked about that is it

1960
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,680
was doing something that I was kind of

1961
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,480
referring to as a um as a mechanic of

1962
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,200
reflection where where the the the

1963
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,559
activity of play is is reflecting, is

1964
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,119
thinking, is you know, just

1965
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,520
contemplating. Um it's not interactive

1966
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,280
in a very kind of, you know, active way

1967
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,359
as we think of it. It's more reflective.

1968
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,039
I I liken it to the moments in chess

1969
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,119
where you're planning your move. There's

1970
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,200
not a lot of action in chess. There's a

1971
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,799
lot of contemplation in chess. Um so if

1972
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,400
it's personal, you know what if that

1973
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,640
were what if that were personal? And so

1974
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,000
what I what I don't particularly care

1975
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,799
about with yet one word is that it

1976
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,279
doesn't it it it inspires you to

1977
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,279
reflect, but it doesn't do it with with

1978
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,560
tremendous grace. It just asks you a

1979
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,319
question. It just comes out, you know,

1980
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,520
kind of out of the blue and says, "Hey,

1981
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,199
you know, when was the last time you

1982
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,400
lied?" Um, and if you, you know,

1983
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,480
sometimes you're surprised by that and

1984
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,040
that's a good effect, but it's also not,

1985
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:33,359
um, subtle. Um, and so I'm trying to

1986
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,640
explore how can we be subtle in in

1987
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,759
causing reflection. And so there are a

1988
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,440
few things here. I mean, the value

1989
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,279
question is interesting. How do you know

1990
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,040
what the value of the object is in the

1991
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,880
box? Um, do you think of it as a

1992
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,480
monetary value? Do you think of it as

1993
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,880
value in terms of significance to the

1994
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,159
person who put that in there? Um, why is

1995
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,600
it significant to the person who put

1996
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,799
that in there? Like what is this thing?

1997
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,799
Right? you can look at and reflect and

1998
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:54,640
and then when you leave a trace of

1999
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,560
yourself in this box, the next person

2000
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,080
who comes and plays is is going to see

2001
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,520
that and they're going to wonder what

2002
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,960
was what was that? And so I'm also kind

2003
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:06,880
of interested in like um the organicness

2004
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:09,040
uh the kind of uh uh the in the the

2005
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,960
never- ending interminable nature of a

2006
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,799
game that that carries the effect of a

2007
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,520
person who's played it kind of on and on

2008
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,880
and on. Um, the next iteration of this

2009
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,640
that I want to do, actually, this was an

2010
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,719
idea that Jason Bean gave me was to use

2011
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,159
um an apothecary chest. Um, because one

2012
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,520
of the things that we play tested it

2013
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,880
here with, I left it out for like two

2014
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,080
weeks and and people, you probably saw

2015
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,040
it, it was right there. Um, you know,

2016
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,880
people were engaging. And this is

2017
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,440
actually this is like a photo with

2018
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,799
objects that people had left in. So, it

2019
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,319
was really fun for me after two weeks to

2020
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,080
kind of go into this box and be like,

2021
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,520
what is all this stuff? You know, like

2022
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,040
like what got left? I was actually

2023
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,319
surprised the sketch, you know, was left

2024
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,239
and then but I was like, wow, what is

2025
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,920
this stuff? Um, and and to give you one

2026
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:48,719
really good example, um, one person at

2027
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:51,120
the lab put in a Nintendo DS flash card,

2028
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,719
um, which was really like a wrapped DS

2029
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,800
flash card. And so now there's this kind

2030
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,920
of this kind of next level. The game has

2031
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,760
changed with another level of

2032
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,640
interactivity where it's like if I want

2033
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,480
to kind of get at what was the uh, what

2034
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,560
was the significance of this object to

2035
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,239
this person, I need to I need to get a

2036
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,920
DS and play this, right? Right. So then

2037
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:10,960
I open up the and it's got it's got

2038
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,800
folders and it's got um you know a copy

2039
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,560
of the game Lemmings. It's got some

2040
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,000
music in it. Right. And so now it's kind

2041
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,239
of like you've you've like uncovered

2042
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
this next layer and it's like you know

2043
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:21,920
the interesting traces of the people who

2044
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,400
have played this game are are now you

2045
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,000
know uh you know marked onto this onto

2046
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,000
this box forever. Marley even said to me

2047
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,960
I was like talking to her about her play

2048
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,320
after she had done it and I was like um

2049
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,480
she told me she wanted to take the

2050
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,000
instructions. um she wanted to take the

2051
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,360
rules as one of the objects that she

2052
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,640
could take out of that. And I told her I

2053
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,920
had thought about that actually when I

2054
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,280
was designing it that someone might be

2055
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,880
like, "Ha, I'm going to take the rules."

2056
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,080
And and I was going to put in a rule

2057
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,760
that said, you know, you can turn the

2058
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,280
exchange for an object that's not the

2059
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,920
rule is so that the game could persist.

2060
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,360
But I but I didn't want I didn't want to

2061
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,640
artificially impose that if someone

2062
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,000
takes the rules because that's what they

2063
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,520
want. That's what and now the game is

2064
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,320
the game has changed. And maybe someone

2065
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,679
comes along later and and modifies it.

2066
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,280
Maybe they put something in that makes

2067
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:02,480
it a whole new different game. And and I

2068
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,000
really like the idea that you can

2069
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,960
encounter this game and that it's going

2070
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,600
to be kind of in this state of flux, I

2071
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,800
guess you could say. Um, and so that's

2072
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,080
what I'm that's what I'm working on now.

2073
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,280
And like I said, it's going to I think

2074
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,040
one of the things I didn't like is that

2075
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,040
all of the objects are accessible all at

2076
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,320
once. Um, so if it's an apothecary chest

2077
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,840
with lots of drawers, this was Jason

2078
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,679
Bean's idea, then you kind of have to do

2079
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,040
a little exploring. Um, and maybe the

2080
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,320
rules are in one of those drawers. And

2081
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,760
maybe you see the rules first, maybe you

2082
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,199
see the rules way after you've looked at

2083
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,320
a lot of stuff. And then you now you've

2084
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,520
seen all this stuff and played with it

2085
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,640
all and you really like something and

2086
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:36,159
now it's like what do I trade? Um

2087
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:39,520
and um and yeah, so I also am trying to

2088
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:41,920
find a way to give the box a a history

2089
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,400
as well. I've contemplated some ideas of

2090
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,719
putting in some some kind of clues that

2091
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,159
you could then if you felt if you

2092
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,640
thought about it or looked it up, you

2093
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,080
might be able to find a story to this

2094
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,159
box. Like if you did an internet search,

2095
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,520
you might come upon a fake website. uh

2096
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,679
wouldn't be fake. It' just be a website,

2097
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,280
but a website with a fake story that

2098
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,800
kind of tells you a little bit about

2099
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,400
this box and maybe gives you a few more

2100
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,159
hooks into what the meaning of this game

2101
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,000
or what the inspiration for this game

2102
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,440
inspiration for this game was. And so

2103
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,800
this is kind of one of my projects that

2104
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,000
I'm working on right now. Like I said,

2105
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,159
I'm kind of I'm interested in

2106
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,120
tangibility, but but you can see where a

2107
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,800
lot of the other things that I was

2108
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:18,239
talking about are kind of inspiring

2109
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,320
inspiring this this work. Um and so we

2110
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,920
kind of come back to that question of

2111
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,960
are games art and whether it's even a

2112
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,760
valid question. We only have five

2113
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,480
minutes. I don't know if you guys have

2114
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:30,560
administrative stuff afterwards, but um

2115
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:32,480
this is like I said, this is sort of my

2116
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,280
viewpoint and I I it's certainly shared

2117
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:38,560
with a lot of other people. Um but it's

2118
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:42,000
not um this is not guaranteed truth.

2119
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:45,199
It's this is an opinion that I have just

2120
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,719
shared. So, um, but any thoughts you

2121
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:51,760
guys have about this subject or these

2122
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:54,719
ideas of these games or

2123
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:58,679
anything at all?

2124
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,679
Yesterday's football game.

2125
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,560
>> Well, cool. Well, I hope this was

2126
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,120
useful. I hope it was helpful. Um, you

2127
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,640
know, I think it if if at the very least

2128
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,239
it causes you to continue to think

2129
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,920
about, you know, your own games that

2130
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:14,640
you're developing and how meaning can be

2131
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,880
embed in in the play that you might not

2132
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,320
even realize is there. Um, but also just

2133
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,760
kind of the possibility space. I I

2134
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,280
really am excited by I'm discouraged by

2135
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,880
the safe choices that a lot of

2136
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,800
independent game developers make and

2137
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,480
excited when some game developers really

2138
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,320
push on the edge. I don't think we have

2139
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,920
a I don't think we have a clear

2140
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,480
understanding of what the rules are or

2141
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,480
what even constitutes a game or what

2142
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,640
what degree of interactivity is

2143
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,719
appropriate for a you know quote unquote

2144
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,120
game. And I think I think some of these

2145
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,719
designers are really testing the waters

2146
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,000
of the medium. You know, what can we

2147
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,719
really do with this? You know, where

2148
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,120
where can we go? How edgy and satirical

2149
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:55,679
and on guard can we be? Um,

2150
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,080
I think that's always good.

2151
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,080
So, I'm a revolutionary

2152
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,239
crazy person.

2153
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:05,719
>> Crazy person.

2154
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,719
That's good to hear.

2155
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,520
>> Folks, um if folks haven't played uh yet

2156
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:14,000
one word this year, which were some of

2157
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,320
the games that uh Abe um worked with the

2158
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,960
team on over the summer, uh those are on

2159
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:21,120
our gamut website uh just opened 2010

2160
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,040
and and you see yet one more in Sier

2161
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,719
which were booked about this summer. We

2162
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,480
saw us like try to see some of the

2163
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,920
digital.

2164
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,199
>> Yeah. And please play them and give us

2165
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,640
feedback too, right? Because that's the

2166
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:33,199
other thing like these are not perfect

2167
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,719
articulations of of game is is the pure

2168
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,640
art form, right? Like we're constantly

2169
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,080
evolving and trying to improve and so

2170
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,360
any feedback you can give us on this

2171
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,320
stuff is greatly appreciated.

2172
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,000
>> I have one question.

2173
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,560
>> Do you still have that box like

2174
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,760
somewhere?

2175
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,040
>> Yeah. Yeah, it's in my office. Yeah.

2176
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,440
Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. I have a box

2177
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:51,520
and I need to I'm I'm So the other part

2178
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:54,320
of it is is when I do the second version

2179
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,080
of it in the apothecary kind of chest,

2180
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,920
uh, one thing that's important to me is

2181
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,600
that each of the I sort of for the

2182
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,840
prototype, I just sort of threw some

2183
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,239
like reasonably meaningful objects in

2184
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,760
there, but I I I want it to be populated

2185
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,679
with objects that are personally

2186
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,600
significant to myself or symbolic to

2187
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,520
myself. and um and populating that box

2188
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,440
at the outset with meaningful objects I

2189
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,080
think is important because it it's you

2190
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,159
know sort of once it's once it's quote

2191
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,080
unquote released into the world for play

2192
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:24,800
right then it's it's constantly changing

2193
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,719
and so that first that first instant

2194
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,640
instantiation of the game is is the one

2195
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,159
that is is kind of about me in some sort

2196
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,640
of sense and about my experiences and

2197
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:34,960
then it becomes the world which is play.

2198
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,360
So, the way that your games kind of

2199
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,320
reminds me of is I'm pretty sure I heard

2200
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,400
this similar that some person uh had a

2201
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,040
pen and so he just kept he started with

2202
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,239
a pen and he kept trading and made

2203
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,520
>> red paper.

2204
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,719
>> Oh, no. Well, no, no, this is a

2205
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,719
different one. Not the red paper clip

2206
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,239
for I heard I think it was someone had

2207
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,520
started with a pen or something and kept

2208
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:56,719
trading it and over the course of like a

2209
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,880
year or two he eventually trade got with

2210
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:01,600
that init from that initial pen he was

2211
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,800
able to trade for a house or something.

2212
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,600
It was okay.

2213
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,199
>> Yeah. No, totally. I mean, and that was

2214
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,719
like sort of an interesting what I like.

2215
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,159
I think it was on eBay, too, right? Or

2216
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,239
something like that. And that's even

2217
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:14,000
using a a pretty well-designed game

2218
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,480
system because eBay is totally a game.

2219
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,159
Um, and using a game system to and

2220
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,360
subverting the system itself to do

2221
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,800
something really kind of interesting.

2222
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,840
And so, I mean, yeah, that's a that's a

2223
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,280
really kind of great it's like a game

2224
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,560
inside of a game, right? And I love

2225
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,000
that. That's it's kind of like the cow

2226
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,760
clickers, right? like making a game

2227
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,040
inside of the game that subverts the

2228
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,719
>> Are you familiar with the concept of

2229
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,280
geocaching?

2230
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:36,480
>> Uh because what when I first saw what

2231
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,159
the game you were talking about that you

2232
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,920
designed it really reminded me of it. Uh

2233
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:41,360
so initially what it was is when GPS's

2234
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,719
first came out, people were like, "Oh,

2235
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,920
hey, this is really cool technology. We

2236
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,000
should think of something fun to do with

2237
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:49,199
it." So what they did was uh these

2238
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,679
people hid started hiding um like empty

2239
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:54,400
tins of like little trinkets and stuff

2240
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:56,000
at various like on hiking trails or

2241
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,920
other And you would look up the

2242
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,280
coordinates on your GPS finder and you

2243
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,360
would find this box and what you would

2244
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,400
do is you you trade a trinket and you

2245
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,320
get a trinket.

2246
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,719
>> And you keep like traveling to these

2247
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,159
other

2248
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,320
>> Yeah. And in that sense like this this

2249
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,520
whole worldwide game becomes really kind

2250
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,280
of changed. Yeah. You know there's

2251
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,800
there's there's some sh there's some

2252
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,000
shared ideas with some location based

2253
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,560
games that do some really interesting

2254
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,480
things with with that where um you know

2255
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,080
whether it's alternative reality but but

2256
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,400
maybe not even with a with a narrative.

2257
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,880
There was one I was reading about um

2258
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,640
that was at uh it was like come out and

2259
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,199
play I think in New York City at one

2260
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,600
point but it was cruel to be kind. uh it

2261
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:33,199
was called. It was a game where um you

2262
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,520
don't you don't know who's playing, you

2263
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:37,040
know who's on what team, but you use you

2264
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,199
use you get missions and you get a

2265
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,040
weapon that's a compliment like um you

2266
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,880
know to kill someone who's on the other

2267
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,400
team, mistake them for a celebrity or

2268
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,920
something like that, right? And so

2269
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,280
you're using these kind of random acts

2270
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,400
of kindness, you know, helping someone

2271
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,520
across the street and you don't know if

2272
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,800
it's like in New York City, so you don't

2273
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,679
know if someone's playing the game. So

2274
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,199
now all of a sudden you're kind of

2275
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,360
wandering around doing really nice

2276
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,960
things for people on the chance that you

2277
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,560
know on a hunch that you have that maybe

2278
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,760
they're playing the game and maybe

2279
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,880
they're not. And so you just help

2280
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,640
somebody across the street which is

2281
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,159
totally nice and and it kind of comes to

2282
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,159
this massive conclusion where you just

2283
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:10,960
have these two giant teams who meet up

2284
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:13,600
at a location to nice each other to

2285
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,840
death basically. Um and so you know

2286
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,600
there there's a lot of really really

2287
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,840
kind of interesting stuff especially in

2288
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,760
the the kind of location based

2289
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,040
>> realm. Big big games are really cool.

2290
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,280
There's a lot of people doing really

2291
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,960
neat stuff with with big games.

2292
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,080
>> Yeah. So, I I I think like in particular

2293
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,360
with you know, the box and the

2294
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,880
geocaching idea, it's and and you know,

2295
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,679
talking about the paperclip for a house

2296
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,840
thing.

2297
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,040
>> It's really interesting like what how

2298
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,520
people value things.

2299
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,960
>> Yeah.

2300
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,480
>> Like in particular, you know, you have

2301
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,320
this very vague rule in it that just

2302
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,320
says, you know, something of of equal

2303
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,120
value. Like what does it actually mean?

2304
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,040
>> Value or

2305
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,719
>> Yeah, exactly. It's kind of interesting

2306
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,920
like what someone is willing to trade

2307
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,960
for for something else.

2308
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,640
>> Yeah. And those are those are the kind

2309
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,760
of implicit rules like you see in 16

2310
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,960
tons, right? Where it's like what

2311
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,640
happens with the money, you know, and

2312
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,679
and and that's, you know, Jason me

2313
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,960
really pointed out because he was

2314
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,239
thinking about value when he was doing

2315
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,840
the training and it's such a good word,

2316
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,199
right? Because value is such a different

2317
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,360
thing to different people and someone

2318
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:08,800
might see the like the the flash card

2319
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:11,440
for the DS, right, which has a very

2320
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,440
clear higher monetary value than than an

2321
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,640
etch sketch. Um, and yet maybe you

2322
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,480
played with an etch sketch when you were

2323
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,280
a kid and all of a sudden it floods back

2324
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,800
these memories that you have. Um,

2325
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,840
there's also there's another component

2326
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,520
to it that I didn't really talk about,

2327
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,239
which is like the sacrificing of an

2328
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,760
object. And and I think too that it's

2329
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:33,760
it's we we tend to be beholden to our

2330
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,760
material objects um too much um in in in

2331
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,040
giving it up in in sacrificing it to

2332
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,239
this game so that you don't have it

2333
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,760
anymore. If it's something of personal

2334
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,360
significance, you're you're letting go

2335
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,360
and and being able to say, "Okay, the

2336
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,719
memory is one thing. I don't need to."

2337
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,480
And that's that's how it relates a bit

2338
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,440
back to Citizen Kane, which is a movie

2339
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:52,400
you should see because it is good.

2340
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:56,120
It's everything they said it is,

2341
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,120
>> depending on who they are.

2342
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,640
>> Cool. Thanks, guys.

2343
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,640
>> Thanks.
