1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,400
So going back to uh these problems that

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,920
we defined earlier um in the first

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,320
problem um we asked how uh it would be

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,679
possible to measure all 20,000 genes in

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
cells um and this uh technology that we

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,480
introduced single cell RNA sequencing uh

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
is the answer to that. This makes it uh

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,640
possible to measure the gene expression

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,880
for all genes uh in 1 million cells.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,760
Um and now we'll move to talk about the

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,200
second problem that we posed which was

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,520
um whether it would be possible to uh

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
delete individual genes in cells and see

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,800
what the effect is on uh the cells and

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,520
specifically on uh the gene expression

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,280
in those cells. And so this is part C

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
where we'll be talking about this uh

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,320
second technology that focuses on uh

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,840
combining these gene pertubations um

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,719
with the cell read out.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,680
So going back to uh the scheme that we

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,400
saw earlier. Um so we spoke about how uh

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,560
from a population of cells we can uh use

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,760
single cell RNA seek uh this first

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,240
technology to um produce this gene

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,880
expression matrix.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,600
And now um in this second technology

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
called uh pertabbse seek um what you can

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,680
do is introduce deletion of a specific

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,400
gene to each of these cells um and then

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
output a similar kind of matrix but now

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
where you can see how this matrix

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
differs from the matrix that doesn't

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,759
have uh any gene deletion or any

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
pertubation.

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,439
So going back to our example uh the

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,119
adiposite uh populations that we have.

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,600
Uh so we saw that in the single cell

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,560
expression matrix we could identify each

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,720
of these three populations by uh each of

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
these three uh clusters of genes

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,040
expressed in those clusters of cells

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,880
specifically.

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
And so how would this look now if we

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,399
combine this with uh the pertubations

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,399
that um the second technology permit us

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
to do?

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,280
So in this case for example we might

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,599
delete the gene sedd. Uh this is a gene

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,560
that's known to be important for uh

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,360
regulation of the lipogenic uh program

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,560
the lipogenic state.

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,040
And so if we delete this gene sedd, what

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
we'll actually um get out is a very

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,120
similar matrix uh except we'll have a

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,080
row added uh that shows um that this

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,599
gene sedd was deleted. Um and we'll have

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,400
a count to show um which cells this gene

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,480
was deleted in. Um and so this is

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,800
showing for one gene, but in theory uh

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,519
we could delete many genes uh and also

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,640
different genes in different cells.

63
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,560
And so what we might see is uh upon SEDD

64
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,959
deletion given that this is a gene that

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
regulates the lipogenic program that

66
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,000
actually um we completely lose

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,400
expression of these two genes SR BP1 and

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,800
uh fast N um which are key genes uh of

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
the lipogenic state and therefore we

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,159
completely um lose this cluster uh of

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
cell five and six that we had uh

72
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,080
previously

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,239
um as a result of this deletion. And uh

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
in this particular case, I picked a gene

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,720
that we know regulates the lipogenic

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800
state uh or the lipogenic program. Uh

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,480
but in another case, it might be a gene

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,720
that we know nothing about. And so this

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,040
would be uh an extremely revealing uh

80
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,760
and interesting result. And so to dive

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
in a little bit more to how perturb

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,799
actually works, it relies on this gene

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,040
editing technology crisper cast 9, which

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,440
you may have heard about uh in the news.

85
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,519
and it won the Nobel Prize uh a few

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,959
years ago.

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,159
And uh the way it works is this protein

88
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,720
called the cast 9 nucleus is guided to

89
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,280
specific parts of uh the genome. So

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,879
specific regions of DNA or specific

91
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,239
genes um and at that specific location

92
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,799
that it's guided to, it will insert a uh

93
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,959
doublestranded break. uh and so what we

94
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,200
can do is um we can manipulate which

95
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,560
genes the crisper cast 9 system is

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,160
guided to by providing uh different uh

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,320
guide RNA molecules. So um we'll provide

98
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,560
a guide RNA molecule for a gene of

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,199
interest uh that we are interested in

100
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,960
deleting or knocking out the cast 9

101
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,120
system will be guided there and then it

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
will lead to this doublestranded break

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,919
therefore uh deleting the function of

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,759
that gene.

105
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,800
And so this is the technology that

106
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,240
perturbse seek uh relies on. Um and so

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,080
to remind you um of what we spoke about

108
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,360
perturb is the combination of two

109
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,919
things. Uh on the one hand using uh cast

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,320
9 to insert uh specific deletions uh in

111
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
individual cells and as I mentioned you

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,919
could have uh different genes being

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,120
deleted uh in different cells.

114
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,360
combining this with uh a similar readout

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,560
as we saw before which is this single

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,639
cell RNA seek matrix where for a given

117
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,560
cell you can count the number of RNA

118
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,759
molecules um but combining this with the

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,680
actual pertubation identity i.e the

120
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,880
specific gene that was knocked out in

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,600
that cell here denoted as A or B.

122
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,199
And so what's the readout? Uh there are

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
two readouts that you'll get. One is

124
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,880
this uh expression matrix uh that we're

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
familiar with uh hopefully by now. And

126
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,000
the second is this uh pertubation

127
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,840
identity matrix that will tell us for

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
each of the cells in the expression

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,080
matrix uh whether there was a

130
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,639
perturbation and specifically uh what

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,360
gene um was perturbed or what gene was

132
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,160
knocked out. So you can see here for

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,560
example that in uh cell one we have the

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
gene expression profile. So the uh

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,240
expression levels for every gene uh in

136
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,520
the genome uh in this cell. And we also

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,039
know that this expression profile um is

138
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,199
the result of um whatever programs were

139
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,199
already inside that cell uh but then

140
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,120
adding the deletion of MLX IPL

141
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,680
and likewise in cell 2 we can see the

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,560
gene expression profile uh and the gene

143
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,919
CBPA that was knocked out and so on.

144
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,160
Finally, we also have uh some cells uh

145
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,080
always in perturbic experiments where we

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,479
don't knock anything out so that we can

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,000
compare each of these pertubation groups

148
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,880
to uh the non-targeting uh it's called

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,800
control

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,080
or in other words the expectation with

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,440
no uh pertubation.

152
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,319
So the advantage of this is that um we

153
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,039
can get this very informative rich uh

154
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,759
transcrytoic readout uh the single cell

155
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,319
expression matrix. We can also as I

156
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,000
mentioned um do these perturbations in a

157
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
poolled format such that different cells

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,120
will receive uh different pertubations

159
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,599
thereby allowing us to cover more of the

160
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,880
uh genome. And we can use this the

161
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
combination of the cells without

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,680
perturbation and the cells uh with

163
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,240
specific perturbations to infer the

164
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,280
functions uh of these specific genes

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,440
that are perturbed.

166
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,039
There are however um still some

167
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,280
downsides. Um, one is that even uh in

168
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,479
spite of this pulled format that allows

169
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,039
us to um profile many perturbations in

170
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,000
parallel um it's still very time

171
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,520
consuming uh and would probably take one

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,039
Thiago uh doing these experiments 22

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,599
years to actually um profile cells

174
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,560
receiving every single of the 20,000 uh

175
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,879
pertubations uh in the genome.

176
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,120
And so this is one uh very key

177
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,599
motivation uh for this challenge which

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,400
is falling short of being able to

179
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,720
experimentally test uh in the lab every

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,199
single perturbation. What we would like

181
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,319
is to be able to use machine learning um

182
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,319
to predict pertubations, their effects

183
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
to predict this matrix, the effects of

184
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
the pertubations on individual cells and

185
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,599
hopefully highlight pertubations that we

186
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,120
um predict to be particularly important

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,000

188
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
biology and obesity.

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,800
And so we'll be talking uh more about

190
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,120
that in the final lecture uh on uh data

191
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
and the crunches that you'll be doing.
