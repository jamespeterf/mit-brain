00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,240
hello everyone and thank you so much for

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,359
your time today uh I'm a recent graduate

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,360
of my team mechanical engineering and

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,719
together with horor and Donald were the

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,440
three founders of eor and early stage

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,920
startup out of MIT Delta V and let me

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,640
share my

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,000
slides so um our goal our goal behind

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,840
ecor is to innovate energy storage to

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,960
tackle the biggest challenges faced by

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,119
the electrical grid Peak demand

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,000
management congestion upgrades to the

13
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,960
Aging infrastructure all of these issues

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
use can be helped by adding more storage

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,399
to the grid without it one of the

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
immediate consequences is rising

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,160
electricity costs now how bad do those

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
get here's an example of an industrial

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,000
utility rate in California which in just

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,960
the last few years has tripled that for

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,760
some of the Facility Owners we know to

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,359
move their business or even shut it down

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
while some storage is getting added to

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,559
the grid it needs to happen faster and

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,800
cheaper and that's exactly what eor does

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,960
we offer an endtoend energy storage

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,320
solution that generates scalable savings

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,880
for businesses it is installed on the

29
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,799
side of a facility behind its

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,799
electricity meter and serves as an

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
optimizing filter between the facility

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
and the grid it changes the shape of the

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
electricity usage from the point of view

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
of the utility which makes it cheaper

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,880
now from the point of view of the

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
customer nothing changes they continue

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,439
operating as they normally would while

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,880
our system runs in the background

39
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,880
generating savings and those are

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,200
scalable because distributed storage can

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,520
help the GD in a variet ways uh that can

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
be monetized so accordingly we're

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,159
stacking different revenue streams

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,960
within our software to maximize the

45
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,399
value of every battery deployed now

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,280
tying this back to integrating storage

47
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,119
faster and cheaper most battery

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
providers Focus either on front of the

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,439
meter utility scale deployments or in

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,399
tiny residential batteries we on the

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,439
other hand are enabling private

52
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,680
commercial industrial customers to

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,079
afford their own storage these customers

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,039
have a burning demand for battery

55
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,079
enabled savings yet they've been vastly

56
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,880
overlooked so much so that existing cni

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,039
BTM offerings only feature manual highly

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,920
limited controls meaning the customer

59
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,120
has to somehow plan battery behavior on

60
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,520
their own uh then try to implement the

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,720
simplest version of it and keep updating

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,760
updating it at on their own as well so

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,959
our software allows us to operate the

64
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,519
battery autonomously and intelligently

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,840
achieving much higher optimal value

66
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,120
extraction now thanks to that efficiency

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,599
we're able to offer rois as high as 35%

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,480
before any incentives which finally

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,920
allows us to provide Affordable Storage

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,319
to businesses and close the gap in the

71
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,640
market we're also working to tackle one

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,400
of the biggest bottlenecks in the

73
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,080
industry deployment by focusing on

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
simpler BTM installations and optimizing

75
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,640
every step of the way we're streamlining

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
storage integration currently we have

77
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,080
six Fain customers and three of them are

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
already moving through our installation

79
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,560
pipeline um and to showcase our value

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
proposition for this customer in

81
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,560
California our system with a footprint

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,280
of of just 30 square ft and the total

83
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,959
space requirement of 160 Square ft is

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,159
projected to produce over 62,000 in

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,040
effortless pure savings every year the

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,159
resulting payback is just three years

87
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,799
without any incentives which is only the

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,680
fifth of the cist of lifespan so we're

89
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,760
quite excited to launch it in the coming

90
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,400
months and last but not least our ask uh

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,959
another customer of ours is part of an

92
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,080
international manufacturer called

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,360
Alberts our project with them opened up

94
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,200
a on to many approach where a successful

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,879
outcome in one company location can lead

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,480
to deployments in the others too so we

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
would love to connect to more similar

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,360
Enterprises with multiple energy

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,920
intensive facilities uh please feel free

100
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,959
to submit a contact form by scanning the

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,560
QR code on the slide and thank you so

102
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,920
much for your attention happy to answer

103
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,760
any

104
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,560
questions great Valeria thank you so

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,480
much so again please um POS your

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,000
questions to the Q&A Tab and indicate

107
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,920
which start of it's for but um I'll get

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
started first um so your targeting and

109
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,120
mentioning energy intensive

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,239
manufacturing facilities but do you see

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,519
opportunities for other sectors as well

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,120
yes absolutely uh We've started with

113
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,159
energy intensive manufacturing because

114
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,919
um that's where the cost savings and Roi

115
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,040
are most immediate but our approach is

116
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,880
designed to scale as we develop our

117
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,400
software further and improve our unit

118
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,520
economics our customer base can be can

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,680
really expand and for example in the

120
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,280
near term Beyond industrial we see

121
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,360
opportunities in Comm commercial real

122
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,919
estate and large scale retail and longer

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,280
term we could install in multif family

124
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,360
residential and even individual

125
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,160
homeowners fantastic um and you

126
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,199
mentioned uh the software enables the

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,840
stacking of multiple revenue streams um

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,759
could you speak to that a little more

129
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
definitely so um as I mentioned

130
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,759
distributed storage typically can be

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
useful for a range of applications

132
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,680
across uh transmission distribution and

133
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,720
behind the meter parts of the grid so on

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,240
the transmission side that includes

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,560
variety of services like energy

136
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,479
Arbitrage and frequency regulation in

137
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,360
distribution it can be all of the

138
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,360
transmission plus deferral meaning

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
helping substations uh level out the

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
load and behind the meter is most

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,080
interesting to us because it can provide

142
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
both transmission and distribution level

143
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,840
services but also individual meter

144
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,280
Services where we actually unlock the

145
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,680
most value so say Peak shaving time of

146
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,199
use shifting automated demand response

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,520
backup or solar self-conception uh happy

148
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:33,759
to explain those further as needed

149
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,759
fantastic thank you again area thank you
