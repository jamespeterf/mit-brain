1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,160
okay uh can people hear me in the back

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,279
we good okay nice let's uh let's get

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:28,080
started so uh last week uh last week yes

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,000
last week uh we started talking about uh

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,279
our number Theory unit and in particular

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
Vis visibility uh and we saw a very

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,600
exciting uh you know application of of

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,640
divisibility saving New York City uh

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,360
today we're going to look at an even

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,239
more exciting example um modular

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,239
arithmetic uh so

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,039
recall so uh we saw bit's identity and

13
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,120
uh the

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,800
pulverizer so I'll just write that up

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,800
here so for all

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,800
integers

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,920
uh a

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,720
B uh there exists s and

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,479
t whoops such

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,960
that uh that's a little bit confusing

21
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:23,360
sorry uh

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:25,799
gcd of a comma b equals a s + b t okay

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,000
and uh moreover we can compute these uh

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,880
efficiently using the uh the pulverizer

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,079
the extended ukan algorithm

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
uh then the other useful fact that we're

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,560
going to make use of

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,560
today

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,560
uh every

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,880
number

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,880
uh can be

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:56,600
written as an

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:02:01,560
ilc of A and B if and only

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,560
if it is divisible by their gcd

35
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,040
okay so we are going

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,040
to make use of these two facts so do not

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,040
forget

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,640
okay oh sorry

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,200
okay so let's start talking about

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,440
modular arithmetic then um I expect that

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,319
at least in some form it is something

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,280
that's you know fairly familiar to all

43
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,159
of you uh so presumably you learned back

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,840
in grade school like what what is the

45
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,519
sum of an even integer and an odd

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,519
integer what what do you know about

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,599
it did people not learn this oh yeah

48
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,239
yeah it's odd okay so first example even

49
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,239
plus odd is

50
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,519
odd even plus

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:15,599
odd is

52
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:17,319
odd okay uh what is the last digit of uh

53
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,959
say

54
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,959
357 by

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:30,319
994 yeah eight yeah so ends in eight

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,400
okay why is

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,159
that yeah you can you can basically

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,239
ignore everything except the uh the last

59
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
two digits uh you multiply those

60
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,400
together you get 28 that ends in an

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,799
eight so this is also going to end in an

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,120
eight okay uh it's currently 2:39 p.m.

63
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,120
what time will it be in 49

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,680
hours 330 yeah about

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,519
339 in 49 hours and why is

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,400
that yeah uh is that an

67
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,560
answer how how are we getting to that

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,720
yeah yeah so 49 hours is one hour more

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
than two full days we can kind of forget

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
about those two days and just add an

71
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,199
hour onto the current time okay uh what

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
day of the week will it be 100 days from

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,120
now Thursday yeah 100 days is uh two

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,400
days more than uh 14 weeks right so we

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,280
can forget about those 14 weeks add

76
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
those two days and we get Thursday okay

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,120
so these are all you know fairly

78
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,000
familiar examples to to most of you

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,440
hopefully of uh modular arithmetic and

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,479
the the theme is kind of that when

81
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,280
you're when you're working modulo n uh

82
00:04:53,479 --> 00:05:00,360
you're just ignoring all multiples of N

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,160
and only focusing on remainders okay so

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,400
even and odd this is the remainder when

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
dividing by two days of the week we

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,160
divide by seven look at the remainder uh

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,520
last digit this is you know remainder

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,479
when we divide by 10 uh our remainder

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,080
when we divide by 12 or 24 depending on

90
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,759
whether you care about AM or

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,919
PM uh and so we often call Modular

92
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,720
arithmetic clock arithmetic for for this

93
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,280
reason uh because it's something that

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,039
people are are familiar within that

95
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,319
context

96
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,639
okay so let's define what we mean

97
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,840
actually why don't we use a new board

98
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,840
for

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:45,000
this so we're going to say that a is

100
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:47,160
congruent n to B so this can be uh that

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,039
this will usually be pronounced uh a is

102
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,880
congruent to b modulo

103
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,880
n uh if and only

104
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,360
if uh n divides a minus B

105
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,160
okay so you might also see this written

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,440
as uh a congruent to

107
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,680
B mod n who has seen this notation

108
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,240
before okay many who has seen this

109
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,440
notation uh couple not quite as many

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,599
okay so uh for the purposes of this

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,080
class um we're going to you know

112
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,080
generally be using this notation we're

113
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,759
going to try not to use the the right

114
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,240
one

115
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,479
right yes right um and I will explain

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,599
why in in a few minutes uh the the right

117
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,000
one even for people who think they're

118
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:45,720
familiar it uh often leads to some uh

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,280
some confusion okay so let's let's try

120
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,319
and stick with this one until you like

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,039
really know what you're doing okay but

122
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,599
uh you know for future reference if you

123
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,479
see the the right one it means the same

124
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,280
thing

125
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,400
okay so basically we would like to

126
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,479
consider a and b to be you know the same

127
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,960
like you can think of this roughly

128
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,680
speaking as

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,440
equals uh if n divides their

130
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,120
difference okay so for example if we're

131
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,199
working modulo 5 there are only you know

132
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,280
five different kind of distinct values

133
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,840
okay

134
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,479
so we're going to notate them like

135
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,840
this so uh that this is uh the

136
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,199
congruence class of of Z modu of 5 so

137
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,039
everything that's congruent to to zero

138
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:41,879
okay so this is going to be 0 plus orus

139
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:45,879
5 plus or minus 10

140
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:48,639
Etc okay so that's you know one set of

141
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,960
of values that are the

142
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,199
same got a second one represented by one

143
00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:01,440
okay and this is going to be you know 1

144
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,440
6 11 uh - 4 - 9

145
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,840
okay so everything that's equivalent to

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,840
one modu

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,639
5 and then we've

148
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,759
got three more okay defined

149
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,000
analogously okay and so for a general K

150
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,319
which of these five groups is it going

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,720
to belong to like how how would we

152
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
figure it

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
out yeah

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,399
yeah so uh the answer was we're going to

155
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,450
divide it by the the modulus five and

156
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,560
look at the remainder okay

157
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,399
[Music]

158
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:51,519
so a general K is going to be an element

159
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:56,120
of the remainder when we divide K by

160
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,920
five okay does that make sense to

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,120
everybody okay so in particular if we

162
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:07,360
write uh you

163
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,240
know K = 5 q + r where R is

164
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,760
between

165
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,240
zero and five then K is going to be an

166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,560
element

167
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,640
of this set

168
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,560
okay so that makes sense to

169
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,560
everybody Rec simply happy with

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,560
this okay

171
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
so more generally recall the division

172
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:51,480
theorem okay so the division theorem

173
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,480
says uh for all pairs um n comma D

174
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,240
with d greater than

175
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,760
zero there exists a unique pair of

176
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,200
integers

177
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,519
uh q and

178
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,959
R with uh zero less than or equal to R

179
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,959
less than

180
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:20,120
d uh such

181
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:23,600
that uh n equals QD + r

182
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,600
okay uh and we say that Q here is the

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
quotient

184
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,040
and we sometimes denote this as uh div n

185
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,160
comma D or sometimes we might write this

186
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:47,120
in infix notation and

187
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:49,279
div D okay and R is the remainder so

188
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,959
this is going to be uh

189
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,880
REM n comma

190
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:58,040
D or sometimes we also write this as n

191
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,850
REM

192
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,240
D okay

193
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,320
[Music]

194
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,399
yeah

195
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,279
sorry oh uh the exclamation after the

196
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,399
exists this means there exists a unique

197
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:17,040
pair uh so not only does there exist

198
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,040
some pair but there's only one of them

199
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,360
okay so when working modulo n uh a

200
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,240
number is always going to be equivalent

201
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,760
to its remainder sometimes we'll also

202
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,880
call this its its residue

203
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,760
okay and you know just as we saw up here

204
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,680
uh these residue

205
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,920
classes uh form a partition of all of

206
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,079
the uh of all of the integers okay so oh

207
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,120
sorry so the the numbers zero up through

208
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,160
n minus

209
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:58,399
one uh these represent you know all of

210
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,399
the possible groupings uh modulo n okay

211
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,040
does that make sense to

212
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,959
everybody

213
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,079
okay so the following

214
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,079
theorem is quite

215
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,079
useful

216
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,120
so A and B are congruent modulo n

217
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,120
if and only

218
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,680
if remainder of a comma

219
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,440
n is equal to the remainder when you

220
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,440
divide B by

221
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
n

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,560
okay so how might we prove this

223
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,560
rigorously any ideas

224
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,440
somebody volunteers

225
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,519
yeah

226
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,839
okay yeah so we're we're going to use

227
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,000
the division theorem right the if if we

228
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,040
apply the division theorem to to both A

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,519
and B we're going to get the same R okay

230
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm going to back up a step first uh at

231
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,440
a very high level what do we need to do

232
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
in order to prove a statement like

233
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,360
this we're trying to prove an if and

234
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,040
only if we have to prove implications in

235
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:55,639
both directions okay so first

236
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:57,240
direction if uh REM a comma n equals REM

237
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,040
B comma

238
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,040
n then

239
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,360
uh a is congruent mod n to B

240
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,320
okay so we're going to

241
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,959
assume that these are equal right so

242
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,759
then the the r that we get from the

243
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:24,519
division theorem is the same in both

244
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:27,079
cases so a = q n + r b = q Prime n +

245
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,920
r

246
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:37,360
okay now what happens when we subtract

247
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:38,720
them well then we get a minus b = n * Q

248
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,959
- Q

249
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
prime plus r - R and this is

250
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,800
zero

251
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,399
okay so now the difference is a multiple

252
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,120
of n so by our definition A and A and B

253
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,199
are

254
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,199
congruent okay does that make sense to

255
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:59,199
everybody

256
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:14,399
yeah uh oh so some examples of a n and B

257
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:17,440
okay uh so for example uh 17 is

258
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,680
congruent mod 5 to

259
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,639
12 okay because five divides the

260
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,279
difference right if you subtract them

261
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:30,240
you get five uh five is a multiple of

262
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:34,600
five so they're congruent okay uh

263
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,680
17 is also congruent to say

264
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,880
32 right if you subtract these you get5

265
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,880
same deal it's not

266
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,440
congruent to

267
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,720
33 okay if you subtract those you get -6

268
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,920
which is not a multiple of of

269
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,360
five

270
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,360
okay any other questions

271
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,199
yeah okay so well this is only half the

272
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,360
proof right we're we're proving One

273
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,160
Direction so we are assuming that uh the

274
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,880
two remainders are the same okay and

275
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,240
we're trying to prove

276
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,000
this right so if the two remainders are

277
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,560
the same right that's you know from the

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,759
division theorem we've got the same R in

279
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,759
both

280
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,839
cases so uh we're going to write them

281
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,720
we're going to write both numbers in

282
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,519
that form okay so a is qn plus r

283
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,199
r b is QPR n plus r Prime but you know

284
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,680
we established that R is equal to R

285
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,199
Prime okay so we're just writing that as

286
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,079
Q Prime n uh plus r okay and now in

287
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,399
order to show that A and B are

288
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,480
equivalent we have to subtract and and

289
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,399
see whether the difference is a multiple

290
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,319
of

291
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,759
n so in this case when we subtract them

292
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:57,120
right the RS

293
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,959
cancel uh the N factors out and we get

294
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,160
uh n * Q - Q Prime

295
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,439
okay so that is indeed a multiple of N

296
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,959
and so uh you know n divides the

297
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,760
difference so they're

298
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:14,559
equivalent

299
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,559
congruent okay

300
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:25,439
yeah uh how we say this a is congruent

301
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,120
to B mod n or a is congruent mod n to B

302
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,840
uh there are you know several different

303
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,840
ways of of saying it

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,080
okay okay what about going in the other

305
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,039
direction

306
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,880
suppose a is congruent mod n to

307
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,720
B now we want to prove that the

308
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,080
remainders uh when you divide by n are

309
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,080
the same how do we do

310
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
that

311
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
y

312
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,760
okay okay

313
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,799
okay yeah so the the last step here is

314
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,400
now to use the division theorem again

315
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,039
okay so if we apply the division theorem

316
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,080
I guess to B is probably going to be the

317
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,559
most useful right we can write b equals

318
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,679
let's do the same form that we had there

319
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,919
Q Prime n +

320
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,000
r

321
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:14,640
okay now a is B plus k

322
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,640
n so that's going to be Q prime plus

323
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:22,679
K * n plus

324
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,360
r okay and now the division theorem says

325
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,480
that this Q prime plus K and R those are

326
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,760
unique okay so that Q prime plus K is

327
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,760
the the Q that we need and the the r is

328
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,440
the same

329
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,440
okay so both of them have the same

330
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,880
remainder okay do does this make sense

331
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,880
to everybody

332
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,320
yeah uh a congruent to B mod

333
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,480
n uh so what we're trying to prove an if

334
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,120
and only if here right so for One

335
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
Direction we're assuming one side and

336
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,679
trying to prove the other and for the

337
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,080
other direction like we did the

338
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,120
opposite right so this is One Direction

339
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,240
we're

340
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,360
assuming that the remainders are the

341
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,080
same and we want to prove that they're

342
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,440
equivalent they're congruent for the

343
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,919
other direction we assume that they're

344
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,280
congruent and then we want to prove that

345
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,880
the remainders are the same okay so kind

346
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,880
of two separate proofs

347
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,520
any other

348
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,400
questions okay so yeah in in some sense

349
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,280
we can consider you know the the N

350
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,960
different numbers like 0 through n minus

351
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,159
one to be you know the only numbers we

352
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,280
care about when when working mod n okay

353
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,600
everything else is going to be

354
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,960
equivalent to one of those it's going to

355
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,240
be equivalent to its

356
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,919
remainder

357
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,960
okay uh so I'm going to take a moment

358
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
here to talk about

359
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,799
notation

360
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:20,960
okay uh so the remainder which we've

361
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,960
called uh REM a comma

362
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:33,880
n uh so

363
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,000
our convention right is that uh you know

364
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,039
even if n is negative this remainder

365
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,679
should always be positive okay not

366
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,240
everybody uses this convention uh so

367
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,760
particular in in particular when you're

368
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,840
dealing with uh programming languages um

369
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,400
most have you know some operation that

370
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,000
looks like

371
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,159
this uh it may be denoted uh differently

372
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,960
in different languages um like sometimes

373
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,520
it's a percent sign sometimes it's

374
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,200
actually you know rem or mod or

375
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,279
something like that and uh sometimes

376
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,840
it'll behave the same as as you know how

377
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,039
we def it sometimes it'll be allowed to

378
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,320
be negative so like if n is negative the

379
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,679
remainder might be negative or something

380
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,039
like that okay and uh some languages

381
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,320
have

382
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:24,120
both uh usually with different names

383
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:28,000
like uh you know mod versus double

384
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,159
mod uh in this class whenever we write

385
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,559
uh RAM m a comma n we always mean the

386
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,320
the positive uh or the the non- negative

387
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,320
remainder so this is always going to be

388
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:44,039
you know between

389
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:48,799
zero and uh n

390
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:51,200
okay um and perhaps even more

391
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,720
confusing uh sometimes this would be

392
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,919
written

393
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:01,080
as mod of a comma n or even worse an

394
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:05,840
infix not a uh a

395
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:08,559
mod n okay so this is why we don't like

396
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,240
to use uh the word mod when talking

397
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,760
about modular uh

398
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,159
congruences

399
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:24,760
um because if you see something like uh

400
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:24,760
say AAL B mod n what does that mean

401
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,840
who can tell me what that

402
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,039
means

403
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,039
MH yeah do do do you have a uh a

404
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,919
guess okay and what why is that

405
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,480
yeah the answer was that's just the

406
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,919
definition um yeah so the the the

407
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,000
important distinction here is between

408
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,000
these two things

409
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,760
right right these are very different

410
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,440
statements okay the mod here is kind of

411
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:24,000
attached to this uh equivalence uh

412
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:28,600
sign and uh so this is you know talking

413
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,240
about a relation between A and B okay

414
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,120
this is a function written in infix

415
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,600
notation okay so that this is saying

416
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,440
that you know a is actually equal to the

417
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,200
one value uh that you get when you you

418
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,720
know divide B by n and take the

419
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,360
remainder okay so these mean different

420
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,520
things it is going to be much less

421
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,919
confusing if you use uh you know a

422
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,480
equals B

423
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,960
REM n or you know in prefix notation REM

424
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,080
B comma n

425
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,600
uh for the left one and a congruent mod

426
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,159
n to B for the right one okay so it's

427
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
hopefully much more obvious what the

428
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,240
distinction is between you know these

429
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,279
two things than between these two things

430
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,240
so please use the ones on the bottom

431
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,000
until you are you know very comfortable

432
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,000
with with modular arithmetic

433
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:30,320
okay okay so let's go uh let's go back

434
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:30,320
to the actual content now

435
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,159
so as I promised before we're actually

436
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,039
going to be talking about arithmetic so

437
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,840
let's let's start on that okay so the

438
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,919
the simple statement that we wrote up

439
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,039
there on the on the left even plus odd

440
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,720
equals uh equals odd in some sense

441
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,080
that's saying something kind of profound

442
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,120
right like you know no matter which

443
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,080
uh even number and which odd number you

444
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,799
pick if you add them together you're

445
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,240
always going to get an odd number

446
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:13,799
okay uh and you know more generally if

447
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:19,600
we take you know any a congruent to

448
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:21,080
let's say 3 mod 5 and any B congruent

449
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,640
mod 5 to say

450
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:28,919
four right if you add

451
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,640
them what do you know about it

452
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,640
what do you know about their

453
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,840
sum

454
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
yeah

455
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,039
mhm so their sum is always going to be

456
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,000
congruent to two module of five okay or

457
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,000
perhaps uh an

458
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,679
easier thing to

459
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,240
see is it's always going to be

460
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,240
equivalent to s

461
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,399
which is in turn you know congruent to

462
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:10,559
two

463
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:13,600
Okay so adding A and B module of 5 like

464
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,480
you you get the same result as if you

465
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,480
you know add these two equivalent

466
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,480
remainders

467
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,159
okay so we have a

468
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,159
theorem suppose

469
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,320
that uh

470
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:41,120
A and B are equivalent mod

471
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:47,320
n then for all C we have the

472
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:51,760
following uh I have space here so a +

473
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:59,880
C is congruent to B+

474
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:05,080
C uh a minus C is congruent to B minus C

475
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:08,760
uh C minus a is congruent to C minus

476
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,760
b and a *

477
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,760
C is congruent to B *

478
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,760
C

479
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:24,159
okay so as you might expect you know if

480
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,679
you want to add subtract or or multiply

481
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,440
modulo n you're kind of allowed to

482
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:34,320
replace things wherever you want with uh

483
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,080
something it's equivalent to

484
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,000
okay so at any point during this

485
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:45,120
computation you can you know replace uh

486
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,320
oh sorry different A and B uh that this

487
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,320
this is not relevant for the theorem

488
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,399
statement like if if a and b are

489
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,519
equivalent then you can you know replace

490
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,559
A's with B's wherever you want and

491
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:59,679
you'll get the same

492
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,679
result okay do does that make sense

493
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,679
uh okay so

494
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,799
question what

495
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,799
about a to the C and B to the C

496
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,360
so let's assume that uh you know C is

497
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,360
positive for

498
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,440
now can I say anything about

499
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,960
exponentiation modu

500
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,720
n okay if we assume that uh A and B are

501
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,360
congruent modu n can we say anything

502
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,360
about a to the C versus B to the

503
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,360
c yeah

504
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,640
yeah so uh let let me rephrase that

505
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,240
slightly I you can prove it more

506
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,480
formally by induction

507
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,559
okay right so you can repeatedly

508
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,480
multiply every multiplication is going

509
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,360
to give you you know congruent values

510
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,600
okay so by the time you get to to a

511
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:35,559
power of C there's still going to be

512
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:39,080
congruent okay so yes this is true and

513
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,080
proof by

514
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:50,360
induction on C okay so our base

515
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:52,039
case is going to be when C equals 1 okay

516
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,200
in this case you know our assumption is

517
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:58,279
that a is congruent to

518
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,000
B right so a to the 1 is congruent to a

519
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,799
well it's equal to a b to the 1 is equal

520
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,279
to B so this is

521
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,279
fine uh our inductive

522
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,399
step so

523
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,120
assume that a to the cus one is

524
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:18,360
congruent mod n to B to the

525
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:22,240
cus1 okay now what happens when we uh

526
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,240
when we increment our exponent

527
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,840
what is a to the

528
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:43,120
C

529
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,120
yeah

530
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,480
mhm okay so we can uh you know strip off

531
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,480
a a a factor of

532
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:01,480
a now we can replace each of these

533
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,320
factors

534
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,399
individually

535
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:11,480
okay so by our theorem up there this is

536
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:14,480
congruent to B the cus one * a okay we

537
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,480
can replace this

538
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,279
factor and now by our uh theorem

539
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,720
assumption right we can replace this

540
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,720
Factor as well

541
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,559
okay does that make sense to

542
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,720
everybody okay what

543
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,720
about C to the

544
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,880
A and C to the B

545
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,120
so we just saw that when we're working

546
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,080
modu n we're allowed to you know replace

547
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,519
uh the base of exponents as we like can

548
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,320
we do the same thing with the with the

549
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,320
uh exponents

550
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,480
themselves show pounds for

551
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,720
yes show pounds for

552
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:25,559
no okay no it seems like it's winning

553
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,080
out by popular vote but not by much

554
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,639
there are a lot of extensions

555
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,799
uh can anybody give me a reason why or

556
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,799
why

557
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,880
not

558
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:54,039
yeah uh 2^2 is not congruent mod 5 to

559
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,919
what 2

560
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:59,000
cubed

561
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,360
uh okay that is a true statement um does

562
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,360
that uh does

563
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,480
that yeah so you you are correct that we

564
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
only need one counter example um is this

565
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,000
a counter

566
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:30,679
example so let's see so the the the

567
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,720
claim right is that if a is congruent to

568
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,520
B mod n then C to the a is congruent to

569
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,359
C to the B right we haven't satisfied

570
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,480
our precondition here two is not

571
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:44,679
congruent to three Mod Five okay so you

572
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,440
you are you have the uh the right idea

573
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,480
we do want to find a single counter

574
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,359
example that will suffice to disprove

575
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,040
this uh we're going to need a different

576
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,440
counter example if we want this to

577
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,280
work okay does anybody else have an idea

578
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,400
for a counter example or failing that

579
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
does any have a

580
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,119
proof

581
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,280
yeah okay uh what are the smaller

582
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,800
components like factors of of C

583
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,920
yeah okay

584
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,839
uh

585
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,400
so what do you want to do with those

586
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:37,680
factors of

587
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,160
C I suppose we could you know strip off

588
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,960
you know say a is smaller than b we

589
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,960
could strip off a of

590
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,079
them okay so you want to divide out a

591
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:01,560
bunch of factors of uh C and until we

592
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,560
get something like

593
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,920
this

594
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,920
okay

595
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,079
um how do you divide modern

596
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,359
okay let's look at a concrete

597
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,200
example so let's uh keep trying to to

598
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:41,560
look at

599
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,560
five let's say B minus a is also

600
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,560
five is this a true statement

601
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,920
sorry did did somebody

602
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,920
um is this true for all

603
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,359
C so I I claim that minus one is not

604
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,359
going to work

605
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,520
here right yeah

606
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,079
yeah so anything to the zeroth power is

607
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,119
is one that's that's fine uh the the

608
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,079
problem is uh you know we're

609
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,800
subtracting a from both of these

610
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,200
exponents

611
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,079
right so if say you have b equal 5 plus

612
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,599
a right you're going to end up with five

613
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,599
on on the the right hand

614
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,599
side

615
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,000
right so counter example right is going

616
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,640
to be you

617
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,200
know maybe we could have something like

618
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:10,480
you know C to the one and C to the 6 and

619
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,040
in particular we're going to want C to

620
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
be minus

621
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:31,400
one okay

622
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,400
uh n was five that's

623
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,599
right

624
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,680
okay so this is our counter example

625
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,520
right we've exhibited a specific a B and

626
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,920
N where our you know uh purported

627
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,560
theorem statement

628
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:56,000
fails okay it is not the case that minus

629
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,440
1 1 is congruent mod 5 to min-1 6 right

630
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,319
the left hand side isus one the right

631
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,319
right hand side is positive

632
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,200
one okay so when exponentiating we have

633
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,319
to be careful we are allowed to replace

634
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,599
the bases of exponents we're not allowed

635
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,599
to replace the exponents

636
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
themselves

637
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,119
okay so we will see in a little while

638
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,200
how we can uh you know get around this

639
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,640
to some degree we can do something with

640
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,640
the exponents it's just not

641
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,640
this

642
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,520
okay

643
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,599
uh why don't we take a look at an

644
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,280
example

645
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,200
first

646
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,520
so suppose X is 1

647
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:55,240
1335 to the

648
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:59,319
11111 uh multiplied by 6 +

649
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,319
7799 to the 5

650
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,240
okay uh how might we

651
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,440
compute remainder of X after we divide

652
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,440
by

653
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,040
100 okay how can we use the uh two

654
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,359
theorems that we did prove to compute

655
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,359
that efficiently

656
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
what might our first step

657
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,560
be uh okay so the answer was distribute

658
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,720
this uh across this

659
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,640
addition um I claim that that's going to

660
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,640
make our lives harder not easier

661
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,359
so what what was the theme of the two

662
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,560
theorems that we just

663
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,839
proved if we want to do computations

664
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,240
modul

665
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,760
n we can replace things by you know

666
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,480
other numbers that are easier to work

667
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,440
with uh and which are congruent

668
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,359
okay so Computing the remainder when we

669
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,400
divide by 100 right

670
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:34,560
that's looking for a computation modul

671
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,480
100 okay so we can replace these values

672
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,079
modul 100 and make them easier to work

673
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,680
with

674
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,160
Okay are any of these values that I've

675
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,960
written down uh congruent to anything

676
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,960
nice modu 100

677
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,040
anyone

678
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,640
yeah

679
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,920
yeah yeah so we can just get rid of

680
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,119
these right that's congruent to

681
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,119
35 what else can we

682
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,119
do yeah

683
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,040
uh so we're we're Computing modul 100

684
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,680
right we're looking for the remainder

685
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:42,599
when we divide by

686
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:42,599
100 uh so we know that uh one whoops

687
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
1335 is congruent to 35 modul

688
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,160
100

689
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,440
okay yeah so we're we're getting rid of

690
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,800
the the first three digits and only

691
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,000
looking at the remainder after we divide

692
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,839
by 100

693
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,880
okay so basically the the idea is that

694
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,000
we can do this division you know at

695
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,200
intermediate

696
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,400
steps we we can you know take remainders

697
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,599
uh in the middle of our computation okay

698
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,480
that's that's what these two theorems

699
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:17,119
are are telling

700
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,119
us okay anything else that we can

701
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,920
simplify no does somebody want to do

702
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,119
that computation by

703
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,119
hand no nobody yeah okay

704
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,200
okay

705
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,520
okay okay yeah we can do the same thing

706
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,440
here turn that into just

707
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,720
99

708
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,720
um I claim that we can take that a step

709
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,319
further 99 is not particularly easy to

710
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,280
work with I claim that there's something

711
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:53,040
else it's equivalent to that

712
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,319
is

713
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:03,559
yeah uh not zero negative one yeah

714
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,559
so we can replace the 7799 with negative

715
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,760
1

716
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,440
Okay negative 1 is easy to work

717
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,079
with

718
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,079
Okay so now what

719
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,599
happens yeah

720
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,839
yeah okay so let's exponentiate this

721
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,240
negative

722
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,240
1 so we end up with 6 + 1 which is

723
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,839
7 now what do we do about 35 to the uh

724
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,200
11,111 uh we don't really know how to do

725
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:58,440
anything with with exponents

726
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:01,240
right so let's kind of just try to start

727
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,760
exponentiating it and see what

728
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,760
happens

729
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
okay

730
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,599
so what's 35

731
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,119
squ that's going to be uh well if we

732
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,119
actually compute it it'll be 1225 right

733
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,880
I

734
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:27,880
think is that right 1175

735
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,520
1225 okay so that's going to be

736
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,520
congruent to

737
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,520
25

738
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,920
okay 35

739
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:54,559
cubed well it's going to be 25 *

740
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:58,280
35 okay so that's 875 so that's that's

741
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,280
going to be congruent to 75

742
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,720
okay 35 to

743
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,880
4th uh 35 to 4th is going to be 35 squar

744
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:19,319
squared again so 25

745
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,680
squ okay 25 squ is 625 that also has a

746
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,680
remainder of

747
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,240
25 so what's going to happen after this

748
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,960
point

749
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,119
what happens is we continue multiplying

750
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,119
by

751
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:46,359
35 yeah the answer was it'll alternate

752
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,720
between 75 and 25 right whenever we have

753
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,559
an odd power as long as it's greater

754
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,920
than one right uh when we exponentiate

755
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,599
uh 35 it's going to be 75 whenever we

756
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,839
have an even power it's going to be

757
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,000
25 okay you can you know prove that

758
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,200
formally by

759
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,680
induction not going to do that here but

760
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,599
the point is 35 we've got an odd

761
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,599
exponent here so we can replace

762
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,800
this with

763
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,880
75

764
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:24,680
okay and now 75 *

765
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,680
7 is going to have a remainder of

766
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,839
25 okay

767
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,559
okay so does that make sense to

768
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,280
everybody we perform the computation but

769
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,720
instead of just like doing it over the

770
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:44,000
integers and then reducing mod 100 right

771
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,200
we're reducing mod 100 you know whenever

772
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,440
we can we're we're always trying to

773
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,880
replace intermediate values with things

774
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,079
that are easier to work with okay and

775
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,960
that simplifies our computation

776
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,960
considerably yeah

777
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,599
uh you can perform the computation uh 25

778
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,599
by 21 is possibly an easier one to

779
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,040
do

780
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:23,720
okay okay uh any other

781
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,720
questions yeah

782
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:40,040
yes uh so uh we had six plus -1 to the

783
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,920
5K okay uh so we are you know

784
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,000
exponentiating this this negative 1 over

785
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,880
the integers right negative 1 to uh any

786
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,760
even power is going to be

787
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,799
one okay so

788
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:58,040
we

789
00:48:52,799 --> 00:49:00,359
sorry oh sorry uh 5K 5,000

790
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,559
sorry it's it's not actually

791
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:07,400
um yeah my

792
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:07,400
bad this this kind of

793
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,440
K

794
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,839
okay sorry that's that's that's my bad

795
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,839
any other

796
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
questions

797
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,720
yeah pardon

798
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,920
like oh okay so the the question was is

799
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,280
there always going to be a pattern like

800
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,040
this uh so this is kind of touching on

801
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,119
um stuff that we will see later but yes

802
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,440
there will always be some pattern it may

803
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,599
not be this easy to

804
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,000
find right but you know the basic idea

805
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,480
right is that there are only 100

806
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,760
different values that it that it could

807
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,200
take you know modul

808
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,880
100 right so if you have you know more

809
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,760
than 100

810
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,200
Powers right something's going to have

811
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,280
to collide okay and you know at that

812
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,480
point it'll start

813
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,000
repeating uh here it you know it it

814
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,319
happened to be quite nice it started

815
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,040
repeating you know very quickly in the

816
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,440
the period is only two uh that may not

817
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:22,160
always be the case though okay but we we

818
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:25,079
will see in a moment how to uh uh you

819
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,640
know something more about uh about what

820
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,640
we can say about that okay

821
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,079
okay so we we've seen how to add

822
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,920
subtract multiply how to change the

823
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,960
bases of exponents what about

824
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:48,520
division okay are we allowed to divide

825
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:51,559
modulo n so suppose we

826
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:57,599
have 3x is

827
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:57,599
congruent uh to 3 modul 6

828
00:50:57,799 --> 00:51:03,760
okay so if we had this over the integers

829
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,400
say or over the reals right uh I guess

830
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,440
reals are a better example if we just

831
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:13,160
had you know 3x = 3 how would we solve

832
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,160
this for

833
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,240
X it's it's not a trick question I

834
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:25,280
promise yeah yeah you just divide both

835
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,720
sides by three right you you can cancel

836
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,680
off this three and you just just get xal

837
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:33,640
1 okay so now the actual question is can

838
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,040
we do that you know modu n can we do

839
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,400
that modu of 6 are we allowed to just

840
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,400
cancel these threes and

841
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,559
conclude that uh oops X is congruent to

842
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,559
one modul

843
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,559
6

844
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,280
yeah okay uh so the answer is yes

845
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:59,240
because it's the same as multiplying by

846
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:01,480
1/3 okay uh so remember that 1/3 is not

847
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,520
really uh something that we can like it

848
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,640
it doesn't really make sense modulo

849
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,920
modul

850
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,319
n okay or at least not modul 6 you know

851
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,799
sometimes it might make sense sometimes

852
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,119
it might not we'll see more about that

853
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:16,280
in a

854
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,839
moment um but like what is a third right

855
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,839
we're talking about

856
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,520
integers

857
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,520
yeah so

858
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,119
sorry so other way around multiply

859
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:46,359
instead of

860
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:48,920
dividing okay uh so the suggestion was

861
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:51,520
instead of dividing by three let's try

862
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,160
multiplying by something so that we get

863
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,880
one

864
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,119
here okay so let's you know try to

865
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,319
multiply this like you know multiply

866
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,599
both sides by some

867
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:06,119
a and this should end up being one if we

868
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,960
choose our a

869
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,559
appropriately

870
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,559
okay what a do we

871
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,400
choose does there exist such an

872
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,359
a yeah

873
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,359
yeah okay so the original claim is

874
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,400
false uh the counter example right is

875
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:42,640
that we could take X's three here right

876
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:46,119
3 * 3 is is 9 that is congruent to

877
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,359
three right but X is not congruent to

878
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:50,559
one

879
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:52,880
okay

880
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,440
so the answer I guess to the to the

881
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:59,720
follow-up question is that no there is

882
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,359
there's no such a right we cannot divide

883
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:05,920
by three or you know multiply by

884
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:08,640
something to to uh get one

885
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,359
okay and this is you know basically the

886
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,319
same thing that we were doing last week

887
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:18,559
right we're looking for a solution to

888
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:22,319
you know 3 a is congruent to 1 modul

889
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,480
6 right if we unpack what this uh

890
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:28,720
actually

891
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:31,319
means 6 divides 3 a -

892
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:35,280
1

893
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:35,280
okay is there a solution to

894
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,319
this

895
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,440
no

896
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,480
okay so basically that's asking if we

897
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:57,520
can uh write one as a linear combination

898
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,359
of six and three okay

899
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,559
but one is not a multiple of their gcd

900
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,559
so we

901
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:13,680
cannot okay does that make sense to

902
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:16,079
everybody so we cannot always

903
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,559
divide are there circumstances under

904
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,559
which we can divide

905
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:44,880
yeah uh oh okay so the idea was divide

906
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:46,839
to divide the six as well um yeah I

907
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,920
suppose he could do that um but we are

908
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:52,160
looking you know we are specifically

909
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:58,240
trying to do arithmetic modul 6 so that

910
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,240
may or may not make sense right um

911
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:08,480
but I mean yeah I suppose you could say

912
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:10,079
you know six divides uh 3x - 3 a and so

913
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,000
you could you know factor out a three

914
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,760
and say that you know X is at least

915
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,039
all and in fact that that does

916
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,160
characterize the solutions to the uh to

917
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:22,079
the original problem it's just that may

918
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:27,480
or may not you know that may or may not

919
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,480
be what you're actually looking for okay

920
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,839
okay so under what circumstances are we

921
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,839
allowed to

922
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,160
divide so you know we just saw that we

923
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:49,599
can't divide here because you know

924
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,599
there's no uh solution

925
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,160
to this equation okay what if there is a

926
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,559
solution like what if instead of uh

927
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,160
modulo 6 we

928
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:07,160
had uh modulo

929
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,160
5

930
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,559
okay would we be allowed to divide

931
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:27,920
here if we have 3 X's congruent to 3

932
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:32,079
modul 5 can we then

933
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:36,799
include x is congruent to one module of

934
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,799
5 seeing some nods

935
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:46,160
why well basically exactly the same

936
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:48,640
reason right this exactly

937
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,839
characterizes when what we described

938
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,599
will work okay

939
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:56,280
if

940
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,880
uh the the modulus and the uh Co

941
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,880
efficient we're trying to divide by our

942
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,599
co-prime right if their G gcd is

943
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:07,119
one then we'll be able to

944
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:08,640
divide

945
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,520
okay

946
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,400
uh so more formally let's write out what

947
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,119
we

948
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,599
mean so let's start with a

949
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:24,280
definition so we'll say that uh a

950
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:24,280
multiplicative inverse

951
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:38,559
of let's call it x uh

952
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:44,680
modulo

953
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,680
n uh which we will denote uh x to the ne

954
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,960
1 is a

955
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:01,000
number uh which as you might expect

956
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,000
satisfies the following uh

957
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,640
congruence okay so just as we have

958
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,400
multiplicative inverses over the reals

959
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:18,079
right so x * X inverse should be equal

960
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,240
to one in that case we are defining

961
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,440
something analogous uh when we're

962
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,680
working mod n

963
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,039
okay so does that definition make sense

964
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,039
to people

965
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,440
so as an example

966
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:41,400
right uh one

967
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,400
inverse uh you know so one is a is a

968
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,039
multiplicative inverse of one maybe I

969
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,039
should write it like that

970
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,240
you know

971
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:04,559
anything

972
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,559
okay two is a multiplicative

973
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:14,960
inverse of

974
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:17,000
three Mod Five okay because 2 * 3 is six

975
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,680
six is congruent to one modul

976
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,559
5 okay so two and three are modul

977
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:25,000
inverse modular inverses of each other

978
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:25,000
modu of five

979
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:38,319
the the last part yeah so

980
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:43,440
um what this is saying right is that uh

981
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:46,240
2 * 3 is congruent to one modulo whoops

982
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,880
I should write it like

983
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:53,400
this

984
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:56,480
okay uh so 2 * three is is six right six

985
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,880
is congruent to one module of 5 right

986
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,680
so that means that two and three are

987
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,079
multiplicative inverses of each other

988
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,839
module of five okay because when you

989
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:05,839
multiply them you get

990
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,319
one okay does that make

991
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:27,319
sense okay so when do multiplicative

992
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:27,319
inverses exist

993
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:49,920
can anybody uh finish this theorem

994
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,920
statement can anybody characterize

995
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:57,839
this when is a invertible modul n

996
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:09,079
yeah yeah when the

997
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:09,079
gcd of A and N is one

998
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,640
okay and why is that

999
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:43,400
okay yeah so that's uh that's good

1000
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,680
intuition if the gcd were not one like

1001
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:50,319
say the the gcd is two right so both A

1002
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,359
and N are even right multiplying a by

1003
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,960
anything is going to give you an even

1004
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,640
number right that's never going to be

1005
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,400
congruent to one modul another even

1006
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:01,359
number

1007
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,359
okay so more

1008
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:13,079
formally so a has an

1009
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,640
inverse mod n if and only

1010
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,799
if uh there exists a b so this is just

1011
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:31,599
the the definition

1012
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:34,079
such that a is congruent mod n to

1013
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,240
one

1014
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,520
okay now how do we characterize when

1015
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,520
this is

1016
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:44,119
true well let's unpack this definition

1017
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,359
here okay so this means that n divides

1018
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:46,359
their

1019
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,920
difference so Oops why don't I write

1020
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,760
this

1021
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,760
as AB minus

1022
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,279
one

1023
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,200
okay right so we're saying that n

1024
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:17,039
divides a minus one we're looking at

1025
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,039
what that uh division actually looks

1026
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:23,359
like what the uh what the factor of n is

1027
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:26,640
okay so there's some Q such that qn is a

1028
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,640
minus one

1029
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:37,480
okay now we can rewrite

1030
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:37,480
this so 1 equal a minus q

1031
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:43,960
n okay so we're saying there exist B and

1032
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:49,200
Q such that 1 equal

1033
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:53,920
AB uh plus minus Q * n okay so this is

1034
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:57,640
just saying that one is an ilc of a

1035
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,640
Ann okay

1036
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:16,119
okay and as we saw before this happens

1037
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,119
if and only if the gcd is

1038
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,520
one okay

1039
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,520
so does that make sense to

1040
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:45,960
everybody so if two numbers have a gcd

1041
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,960
of one then we can divide by uh by one

1042
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,960
when working module of the

1043
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,960
other

1044
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,720
okay uh

1045
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:03,440
so if we have say 7x is congruent mod

1046
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:05,799
30 to

1047
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:08,200
14

1048
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:11,599
okay then we are allowed to divide by

1049
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:13,039
both sides because the gcd of 7 and 30

1050
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,079
is one so we're allowed to divide both

1051
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,920
sides by

1052
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:20,480
seven okay so we are allowed to conclude

1053
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:23,920
that X is congruent mod 30 to

1054
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:27,279
two Okay I suppose more formally we'd

1055
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:32,960
want to find a multiplicative inverse of

1056
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:37,599
seven okay uh and I think 13 is such an

1057
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:40,720
inverse 7 by 13 91 yeah so if we

1058
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:43,440
multiply both sides by 13 right we'll

1059
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,559
get a coefficient of one over here and

1060
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,839
we'll get we'll get two uh on the right

1061
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:49,839
hand

1062
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:49,839
side

1063
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:56,160
okay so sometimes you can divide but not

1064
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,160
always

1065
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:27,880
okay so let's use that now to figure out

1066
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:30,599
what more we can say about

1067
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:31,359
exponentiation okay so the following is

1068
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:34,480
a

1069
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,680
theorem which is attributed to FMA as

1070
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,559
many things are it's often known as

1071
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:41,720
fma's little theorem not to be confused

1072
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:43,799
with fma's Last Theorem which

1073
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,559
FMA I I feel like that one should not be

1074
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:48,760
attributed to him at all um because he

1075
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:50,920
didn't prove it or I think he thought he

1076
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:55,559
knew a proof and was like a complete

1077
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:57,000
 up but you know whatever uh f

1078
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:58,559
little theorem is a different story it

1079
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,039
is uh you know much more Elementary he

1080
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:07,359
did actually prove it um it states the

1081
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,359
following uh so if p is

1082
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:18,080
Prime and a is not a multiple of P so a

1083
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:21,080
not congruent mod P to

1084
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:25,719
zero okay

1085
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:29,120
then a to the P minus one is congruent

1086
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:29,120
mod P2

1087
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:35,120
one okay

1088
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:37,120
[Music]

1089
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,880
so if you think about what this is

1090
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,279
saying a little bit right um it's

1091
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,880
similar to what we were trying to do

1092
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,199
with with exponents

1093
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,279
earlier but instead of getting rid of uh

1094
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:50,679
you know multiples of of p in an

1095
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:51,640
exponent when working working mod P

1096
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:53,239
we're instead going to get rid of

1097
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,880
multiples of P minus

1098
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:59,199
one okay so so basically we can always

1099
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,560
factor out an a to the P minus

1100
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:06,560
one without you know changing uh the end

1101
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:09,560
result

1102
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,560
yeah

1103
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:17,040
sorry thank you Zach I promise I'm

1104
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:21,159
awake yeah if if a is congruent to zero

1105
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:23,319
then um clearly this theorem is false uh

1106
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:25,199
yeah a a should not be congruent to zero

1107
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:26,960
if if a is congruent to zero then a to

1108
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:29,759
the pus one is also

1109
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:34,600
zero

1110
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,600
okay uh so how could we prove this any

1111
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:49,159
ideas it's a bit of a weird proof idea

1112
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:51,880
let's consider the following

1113
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:56,400
Set uh so

1114
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:59,280
a 2 a 3 a

1115
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:02,560
all the way up to P minus

1116
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,560
one *

1117
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,560
a

1118
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,239
okay

1119
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:17,560
now what can we say about this set if we

1120
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:17,560
reduce everything in it modu P

1121
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:36,000
MH yeah so the answer was that you know

1122
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,960
this is basically equivalent to this is

1123
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,960
abusing notation a

1124
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,840
bit

1125
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:52,080
okay the claim is that all of these are

1126
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:56,760
distinct modul p and none of them are

1127
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:58,400
zero okay why is that

1128
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,640
now first probably the easier part why

1129
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,800
is none of these

1130
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,640
zero that's basically saying why is none

1131
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,640
of them a multiple of

1132
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:12,840
P well all of the coefficients on a are

1133
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,560
less than P so P doesn't divide any of

1134
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:17,719
those P also doesn't divide a by

1135
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,760
assumption and P is prime so doesn't

1136
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:23,440
divide any of these

1137
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:27,560
products okay so none of these is

1138
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,560
zero why are they all dis in

1139
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,360
modul yeah

1140
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:04,000
okay um let me try and rephrase

1141
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,159
that uh so if you look at two different

1142
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,320
values

1143
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:09,520
right like two different coefficients

1144
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,520
you

1145
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:13,880
said so suppose for

1146
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,040
contradiction a * I equals a * J right

1147
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,760
so where we're actually going to use a

1148
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:27,159
instead of n

1149
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:27,159
okay or sorry this should be

1150
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,280
P okay what is this telling

1151
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,760
us

1152
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:56,280
yeah that's right

1153
01:12:50,960 --> 01:13:00,080
yes yes so the answer was uh p is prime

1154
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:02,440
so A and P are co-prime right so a has

1155
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,520
an inverse we can consol

1156
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,440
it so this tells us that I is equivalent

1157
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,840
mod P to

1158
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:13,840
J right the two coefficients are

1159
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,760
equivalent the two coefficients are

1160
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,159
coming from the set 1 to P minus

1161
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:23,120
one so if they're congruent mod P

1162
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,120
they're actually equal okay

1163
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,239
so that means that all of these values

1164
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,960
are going to be distinct modul

1165
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:37,880
P none of them are zero so they're you

1166
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,880
know these particular

1167
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:45,920
values okay what happens when we

1168
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,920
multiply everything in s together

1169
01:13:55,239 --> 01:14:00,040
well if we multiply everything in this

1170
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,040
set what do we

1171
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:10,719
get

1172
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:16,679
yeah yes uh P minus one factorial that's

1173
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,679
what it's

1174
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,239
called

1175
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:23,639
so if we take the product of both sides

1176
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:27,040
we have you know the product of this or

1177
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:27,040
sorry the product of this one

1178
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:35,880
is going to be equal to P minus one

1179
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:39,480
factorial

1180
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,480
okay what about the other

1181
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,960
one well the other one is going to be

1182
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,480
the same except we've got a bunch of

1183
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,480
factors of a right how many factors of

1184
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,000
a yeah

1185
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,159
yeah and so this will be a p

1186
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:19,159
minus1 * P

1187
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,159
minus1

1188
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,280
factorial

1189
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:27,159
okay so P minus one factorial

1190
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,560
is equivalent to P minus1 factorial time

1191
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:32,159
a p minus

1192
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,159
one what does that tell

1193
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,440
us

1194
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,000
yeah okay so the answer was that because

1195
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,320
p is prime

1196
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,080
none of these

1197
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,280
numbers right are a multiple of P so

1198
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,480
their product is not a multiple of P so

1199
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,159
P minus one factorial is not a multiple

1200
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,480
of P so it has an

1201
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:10,760
inverse so that means that we can cancel

1202
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,280
it from both

1203
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:16,560
sides and we end up with one is

1204
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,560
congruent to a to the P minus

1205
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,920
one

1206
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:32,280
okay so we have uh P minus one factorial

1207
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:35,560
conent mod P pus1 factorial time a

1208
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,560
pus1 these

1209
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,960
canel and we have one is congruent to a

1210
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:44,199
to the P minus

1211
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,679
one

1212
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:48,120
okay and that's the uh result that we

1213
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:52,440
were looking

1214
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:55,560
for okay so if we're working mod n we

1215
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:58,520
cannot generally reduce exponents

1216
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:02,239
n but if n is prime we can instead

1217
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:02,239
reduce mod uh nus

1218
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,760
one okay do does that uh does that make

1219
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,760
sense to

1220
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
everybody

1221
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:31,679
so as an

1222
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:31,679
example so if we wanted to say find

1223
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:42,560
uh the remainder of seven to the say uh

1224
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:46,320
95 uh

1225
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,320
modulo let's say

1226
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,920
13 okay how might we do that

1227
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:05,120
well 13 is

1228
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:09,600
prime so instead of computing 7 to the

1229
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:10,960
95 let's reduce that Mod 13 minus 1 so

1230
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,520
modul

1231
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:18,679
12 okay so this is going to be the same

1232
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,679
as 7 to the what is it

1233
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:23,679
11 13

1234
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,760
okay now what can we

1235
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:47,120
do what is 7 to the

1236
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:57,239
12 H

1237
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,840
sorry did did somebody give an answer I

1238
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:07,000
I

1239
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:13,280
no one yes okay so 7 12 is

1240
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:17,000
1 right 7 11 * 7 is 7 to the 12 so this

1241
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:20,480
is the modular inverse of 7 modular

1242
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:26,719
13 okay what can you multiply seven by

1243
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:26,719
to get one Mod 13 yeah two

1244
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:38,239
okay so that's all we have time for

1245
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,520
today um I will see you on Thursday and

1246
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:43,159
if you have any questions you know feel

1247
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,159
free to come up and ask
