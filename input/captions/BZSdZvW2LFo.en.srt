1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
There's all these hidden things that are

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,520
around us that are the stuff that makes

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,639
up our world that make up the the the

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,200
food we eat. Uh the the pharmaceuticals

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,120
we make uh the the chemicals and

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
materials that are around us, the

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
materials we use to build our built

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,320
world, those are also extraordinarily

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,640
carbon inensive. They lead to huge

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,560
amount of emissions that arise from the

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
production of those materials. things

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
like steel. We, you know, we we make

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,719
enormous quantities of steel around the

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,440
world. We build literally skyscrapers

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,239
with steel. Every single atom in that

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,239
steel corresponds to a certain number of

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,399
molecules of CO2 that were emitted to

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,399
make that
