The modern world is in transition to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,879
intensive electrification. In the area

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,720
of stationary storage, there's the

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,960
liquid metal battery which I invented

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,800
here at MIT. The liquid metal battery

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
consists of two electrodes and an

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,080
electrolyte. In this case, the

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
electrodes are liquid metals. One is a

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
low density liquid metal, something like

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
calcium, and a high density liquid

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,560
metal, something like anamony, could be

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,039
lead, could be zinc. And the electrolyte

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,199
is calcium chloride, which is road salt.

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
As the battery discharges, it generates

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
heat. And we trap that heat to keep the

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
battery at operating temperature. So

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
after that we don't put any energy in.

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,800
Battery discharges, generates heat,

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
charges, generates heat. So let's say

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
you have an intermittent power source

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,520
like solar. You put the storage at the

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,000
load center. It enables intermittent

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,879
generation and it would even make the

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,360
existing grid more resilient.

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,039
