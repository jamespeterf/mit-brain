00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,359
let me Define a system as a set of

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,120
pieces that have relationships which

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,320
performs a function what I need to add

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,960
to my definition of systems is that the

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,840
pieces and their relationships work to

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,200
produce some functionality or

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,960
performance that is greater than the

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,240
parts individually and I'm going to call

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
that emergence right now I'm showing

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,199
pile of sand and a funnel and I'm going

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,840
to ask what emerges when I put them

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,679
together Tim keeping emerges and I love

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
this example because these are two very

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,279
different objects that don't have a a

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,960
relationship now I have an hourglass and

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,000
I get timee keeping out of it emergence

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,800
is not always a positive this is

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,399
actually a picture of Katrina and when I

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,360
look at the storm that was Katrina plus

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,160
the levy system in New Orleans what I

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,719
have is an emergency emergence and

22
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,480
emergency have the same root word

23
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,480
because I'm combining two different

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,960
pieces and looking at a system that has

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,000
Behavior greater than the Su of its

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,440
