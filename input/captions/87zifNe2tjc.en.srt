1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,559
OEERS. What are they? How can I find

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,240
them? What do I do with them? Glad you

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,759
asked. Hello, my name is Carlos

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
Gutierrez and I'm an intellectual

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
property coordinator for the online

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,640
worldwide learning services or ALS team

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
at MIT Open Learning. The focus of this

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,199
video is to introduce you to open

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,519
educational resources or OEERS and then

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,240
engage in a practical exercise using a

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,400
resource guide. It was developed by MIT

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,200
libraries and anyone can use it to find

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,280
and source OEARS. But first, let's go

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
over a brief disclaimer. The purpose of

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
this video is informative, meaning

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
nothing I say here should be construed

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,440
as legal advice. All right, with that

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,480
out of the way, let's outline what we'll

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,039
cover. What is an OEAR? The OEAR

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,200
resource guide. What can an OEAR be used

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
for? A walkthrough of the resource

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,719
guide. And then finally, we'll try an

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,960
activity.

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,239
Let's start with some definitions. What

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,559
are OEARS? OEARS are free and openly

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
licensed educational materials. This

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,000
could be books, articles, diagrams,

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,600
presentation slides, assignments, and

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,400
the like. And they can be used for

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
teaching, learning, research, and other

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,159
purposes. You'll notice that free part

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,720
first. The idea is that they're not

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
offered for profit. The openly licensed

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,759
part pertains to its copyright status,

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,920
which we'll cover further in the video.

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,360
Now within the category of OEARS, we

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,960
have to make a distinction between open

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,040
access materials versus open license

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,799
materials. Open access as a term relates

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
to content that can be viewed by anyone

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
free of charge without any other barrier

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,200
except perhaps registering for a website

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,280
account or logging into one. Open

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,119
license relates to reuse and what

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,240
obligations, if any, we need to follow

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,079
to engage in that reuse. In some cases,

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,000
open access and open license rights

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,320
overlap, which means you are both free

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,320
to view and free to reuse. In other

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,360
cases, they don't overlap and some

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,280
restrictions do apply. The OAR resource

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
guide is a tool for others interested in

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
finding OAR materials. It was put

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,240
together by one of MIT libraries expert

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,759
librarians, Nicholas Alba, who helps

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,080
source many OAR repository options.

57
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,480
The MIT open resource guide compiles

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,879
OARS by category and shows you where to

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,560
find them. It includes books, articles,

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,000
teaching resources, and news

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,319
organizations. Okay, so now that we know

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,800
what an OEAR is and we have a tool to

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,280
find it, but here's another question.

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,879
What can OEARS be used for? They can be

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
used to teach workshops or provide

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,560
reference assistance. They can

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,879
supplement materials for massive online

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
open courses or other course types. and

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,599
they can aid with educational content

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,760
creation in

71
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,879
general. Now, here's the thing with

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,879
OEARS. Remember when I said they could

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,519
be either under open access or open

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,640
license or both? Well, that's the tricky

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,080
part. It's not always clear. So, once we

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,160
have a resource that could potentially

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
be an OEER, we need to determine its

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,879
license type. To do so, we need to first

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
identify copyright ownership and any

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
restrictions that apply.

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
Something that can help is that the

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,280
repositories or databases linked in the

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,280
guide may have openlicicensed and all

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
rights reserved materials categorized in

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,640
their search results. However, open

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,239
licenses can still carry obligations. In

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,159
the exercise, I'll go over how to

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,480
determine what those obligations are and

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,519
how to parse them out. For now, let's

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,360
focus on finding OEARS.

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
The resource guide can be helpful to the

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
sourcing process since it's a gateway

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,080
for various OAR options all in one place

94
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,799
and therefore can prove useful for those

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,440
who create educational content. Here are

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,799
some of the main repositories it

97
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,200
compiles. There are article options like

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
core and the digital commons network.

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
OAR book options are also included like

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,680
the directory of open access books as

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
well as teaching resources and news

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,519
organizations including one you may be

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,040
familiar with called open courseware or

104
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,879
OCW. So now that we know all this, we

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,799
can engage with the resource guide in an

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,439
activity and put everything I've talked

107
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,280
about into action. The first activity is

108
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,080
a simple search for a specific OAR

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,599
article in the core online database. The

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
purpose is to find the copyright

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,400
information related to the article and

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,599
then examine how open the article is.

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,479
Here it's important to know the

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
difference between open access and open

115
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,840
license. Let's go ahead and do that.

116
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,240
Navigate to core and search for this

117
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,960
article. Quote the role of synthetic

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
biology in NASA's missions. End quote.

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,840
Or use the keyword synthetic plus

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
biology plus NASA. Once you find the

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
article, locate any copyright

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,280
information you can spot. If you get

123
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,040
stuck, you can find a direct link to the

124
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,320
article by clicking download from data

125
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,720
provider. Based on what you found,

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,960
answer this question. How open is the

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,639
resource? If you want, you can hit the

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,120
pause button and come back to this video

129
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,120
once you Finished.

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
Great. That article is in the public

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,720
domain, which is often the case with

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,759
resources created by the federal

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,199
government. Now, let's try something a

134
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,880
little different. For our second

135
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
exercise, we're going to go back to the

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,280
resource guide and navigate to the

137
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,759
digital commons network. Once there,

138
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,320
search for these keywords. quote Salish

139
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,960
C end quote. Click on the keyword

140
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,800
filters on the left to sort out the

141
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,120
results. Find quote the toxicity of

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,840
dopamine on Salish C phytolanton end

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,600
quote by Allison Lombardo and locate any

144
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,600
copyright information you can find in

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
the

146
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,120
results. Once you've done that, answer

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,919
this question. Is this article allowed

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
to be used for commercial purposes? You

149
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,319
can pause here and come back to the

150
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,319
video once you're done like before.

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
That paper is free to use for scholarly

152
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
purposes. So if you wanted to use it as

153
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
part of a presentation or assigned

154
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,280
reading, you're good. But if you want to

155
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
use it for a commercial purposes, say by

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,919
selling it as part of an educational

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,360
product, you need permission from the

158
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,880
author. For our final exercise, we're

159
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,199
going to try more of a free form type of

160
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,680
approach. I'll help you get there, but

161
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,120
what you find is completely up to you.

162
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,520
Return to the resource guide and

163
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,360
navigate to core. Pick a tool keyword

164
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
combination to search for. It can be

165
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,240
whatever you want. Then select a

166
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,759
resource from your search results. Now,

167
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,599
attempt to locate the copyright

168
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,319
information in the result and determine

169
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,000
how open the resource is. You can pause

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
here and come back for the final part of

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080
the video.

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,919
Hopefully in the last exercise, you got

173
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,680
to put what you've learned to use and

174
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
maybe even found a resource you can use

175
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,919
in your own teaching environment. I hope

176
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
this walkthrough and the resource guide

177
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,680
have been useful in helping you delve

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,800
into the world of OEARS and I want to

179
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,800
thank you for your time and attention.
