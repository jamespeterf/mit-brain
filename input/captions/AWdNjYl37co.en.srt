00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,480
Hello everyone and welcome to the

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,120
startup lightning talks. This is the

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
more fast-paced part of the conference

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,960
today. I'm Marianstein, program manager

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,480
with MIT startup exchange and I'm glad

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,240
that you're here with us in person and

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,960
also thank you to those joining via the

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,840
liveream. Shortly you will hear from 10

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
exciting startups. They're among those

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,160
that have more recently joined Startup

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,320
Exchange and they're working on nimble

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
solutions that are benefiting a variety

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,920
of industries including manufacturing,

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,000
energy, defense, mobility, finance,

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
agriculture, and retail just to name a

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,879
few. They will share a little bit about

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,480
their applications and use cases. And

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,200
they're looking of course for more

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
partners and customers. So I hope that

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,199
after their presentations you talk with

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,199
them a little more and explore what's

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,440
possible today.

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,280
So first though I will share a little

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,280
overview of our program.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,360
MIT startup exchange was created to

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,760
support MIT connected startups as they

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,920
grow, expand and help solve some of the

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,439
world's greatest challenges. And we do

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
this by fostering partnerships and

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,840
collaborations between the startups and

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,159
industry primarily members of the

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,159
industrial design program or ILP

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
represented by so many of you here today

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,720
and also the MIT innovation ecosystem

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
and beyond.

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,040
The startups in the program have a very

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
strong connection to the institute. They

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
may be based on licensed technology or

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,040
may be founded by MIT faculty, staff or

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,280
alumni. and they could also be vetted by

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,240
some of our MIT peers including the

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,759
engine start nano or cel startup connect

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
plus

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,200
we have around 800 startups in the

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,240
program as skayatri mentioned earlier

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
today and they usually join at pilot

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,680
stage or beyond and they may represent

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,119
any sector and any geography and here

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
you can see some of the trending

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,840
technologies of the MIT startups and

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,000
I've noted in bold those represented by

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
the startups joining today of course we

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
start with AI and ML big data and

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
analytics, robotics, IoT and sensing,

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,319
sustainability and many others.

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,120
So when it comes to value,

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,360
we have a very customized approach and

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
we do this in a variety of ways. Um

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
everything that we do is for the

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,360
exposure of the startups and um creating

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,000
opportunities for connections to

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,440
industry. For example, we launch call

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,440
for startups. We call these

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,680
opportunities and they're based on

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,000
corporates's priorities and internal

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
challenges. And as a startup, you can

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,480
apply on the website and if selected,

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
you can work with an ILP member to help

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,879
them solve a problem that they may be

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,120
facing in the industry. We also host

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
one-on-one meetings, virtual demo days,

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,800
other webinars, and conferences like

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,599
today where there are startup lightning

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
talks and an exhibit. And we also host

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,920
workshops and trainings sometimes in

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,599
conjunction with other MIT peers. So I

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
hope everyone is taking advantage of

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,640
these benefits and let us know any

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,920
questions throughout the day.

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,200
And so here you can see some of the

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,519
success cases that um have developed

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
between the startups in our program and

83
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,400
ILP members. This is just a very small

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,200
sample and they can take the shape of a

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,360
proof of concept proof of concept um a

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,599
large scale pilot becoming a customer um

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,239
joint R&D and all the way even to an

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,920
acquisition for example. So my hope is

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
that some of the conversations that

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,799
start here today will lead to more of

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,319
these success cases.

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,159
And before passing it on to the

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,599
startups,

94
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,080

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,360
upcoming events. On December 10th, I
