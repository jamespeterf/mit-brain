2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,760
hello everyone and welcome back to uh

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,920
this introductory lecture series for the

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,360
data science Challenge and this lecture

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,119
is going to cover uh technology so in

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,800
the previous lecture you saw um this

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,240
introductory material on te- cells and

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,519
how they fight cancer and become

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
exhausted and so what we really need are

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,480
Technologies to actually measure the te-

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,560
cells characterize what they're doing

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
and learn how we can change those States

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
and that's really where the technology

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,879
comes in in this lecture what we're

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,360
really going to be focusing on to begin

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,840
with is measuring a gene expression in

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,239
single cells and so this is broken down

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,440
into sort of three areas one is

19
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,719
revisiting gene expression programs then

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
talking about how we're going to measure

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
those gene expression programs in single

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,840
cells and then how we're going to do

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,879
perturbations to cells and measure gene

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,600
expression programs in those

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,399
cells so uh gene expression programs so

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,559
to remind you all um genes are um you

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,760
know the f Al units of heredity uh in

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,840
all organisms and they're passed down to

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,080
us from our parents and genes contain

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,119
information that specifies um all our

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,960
physical traits such as you know our

32
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,360
height or our eye color and also

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,040
biological traits such as how we respond

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,560
to different diseases and genes are

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,079
written in DNA and using this four base

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,600
code of AD thyine cytosine and guanine

37
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,439
or ATC and G so in each of our cells uh

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,520
genetic information flows from DNA to

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,720
RNA to protein so remember our genes are

40
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,320
encoded in DNA and then this DNA can be

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,759
copied or transcribed into an RNA

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,880
molecule and then that RNA molecule can

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,439
be translated into a protein and it's

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,040
these proteins that are really giving

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
the cells the different functional

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,159
capacities uh that they have across

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,479
these different tissue types and so the

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,719
genes and uh which genes are expressed

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,960
are controlled by Gene regulation and

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,320
Gene regulation is to lead to um

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,159
different genes and proteins being

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,799
expressed creating this functional

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,560
diversity we see across the cells and uh

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,680
in gene regulation we have gene

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,680
expression programs and these programs

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,319
are groups of genes that are expressed

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,280
together or turned on together during a

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,120
biological process so when a biological

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,000
process gets turned on RNA and protein

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,120
need to be made so you need more of an

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,720
RNA and more of a protein in order to

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,519
carry out that process and so that's

63
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,840
this idea of a gene being turned on and

64
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,519
RNA being made and protein translated so

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
by measuring the levels of RNA we can

66
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,040
learn what genes have been turned on or

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,120
off in a cell and that tells us uh what

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,720
the cell is really up to so to recap

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,120
each cell type and state is encoded by a

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
different gene expression program

71
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,519
different sets of genes and by measuring

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,239
the levels of the RNA we can learn what

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,879
genes have been turned on and are

74
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,200
defining that program so now let's

75
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,360
connect what we learned about gene

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,159
expression program

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,599
to the t- cell states that we uh

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,120
previously discussed in the first

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,840
introductory lecture so to remind you uh

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,159
the t- cell States in in cancer are

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,239
going from this progenitor state to this

82
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,599
affector state and finally this terminal

83
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,840
exhausted State and uh these states

84
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,080
differ in their ability to kill uh

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,319
cancer cells where the progenitor States

86
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,120
and the affector states are strong at

87
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,360
killing tumor whereas the terminally

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,560
exhaust state is very weak at killing

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,560
tumors and this this ability kill tumors

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,400
is really uh defined by the gene

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,799
expression programs in those cell States

92
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,959
so each state has a different gene

93
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,200
expression program and now let's just

94
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,959
look at a few of the genes that Define

95
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,400
uh those gene expression programs for

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,799
each t- cell state so for instance in

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,599
the progenitor T cells we see a

98
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,599
expression very high expression of this

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,640
Gene tcf7 and we know that tcf7 is

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,799
important for maintaining the progenitor

101
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,519
t- cell state so when we see High

102
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,439
expression of tcf7 in a Cell uh we know

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
that that gene expression program is

104
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,519
really defining or kind of indicating to

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,120
us that this is a progenitor t- cell

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,239
likewise uh in the affector te- cells uh

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,120
we see high levels of expression of prf1

108
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,560
um this is a gene that's important for

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
forming pores On Target cancer cells

110
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,320
that lead to the death of the cancer

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,000
cell so that's a gene that we already

112
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,080
know is important for the affector kind

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,360
of t- cell killing activity so when we

114
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,479
see high expression of prf1 high

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,120
expression meaning High numbers of RNA

116
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,600
molecules we know that that t cell is in

117
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,800
the affector state and then finally we

118
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,560
have the terminal exhausted T Cell state

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,919
where we have high expression of the

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,720
gene pdcd1 now pdcd1 we've actually seen

121
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,560
before in the previous lecture pdcd1

122
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,919
encodes the protein pd1 and this is a

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,039
target of immune checkpoint blockade and

124
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:59,039
the pdcd1 gene that encodes pd1 it gets

125
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,360
engaged and it leads to the t- cell uh

126
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,440
killing activ being inhibited and so the

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,960
cells lose their ability to kill Target

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,800
cancer cells so when we see A- celling

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
the gene pdcd1 at high levels we know

130
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,400
that that's likely a t- cell that's in

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,600
the terminal exhausted

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,600
state so um this is just these are just

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
a few of the genes that Define the gene

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,440
expression programs for each of the t-

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,319
cell States however um in reality gene

136
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,759
expression programs are defined by tens

137
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,440
to hundreds of genes not just two genes

138
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,000
alone so we really need technologies

139
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,319
where we can measure the expression of

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,160
genes where we can look at how much RNA

141
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,120
is being made for each gene and

142
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,360
quantitatively measure that and we can

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,080
use those measurements to exhaustively

144
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
define the gene expression programs for

145
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,560
each of the t- cell States so we'll talk

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
about what those Technologies are so

147
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,680
that's the first problem we want to

148
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,400
discuss and the second problem is once

149
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,960
we have a good understanding of the gene

150
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,880
expression programs in the in the t-

151
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,080
cell States we would really like to um

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,039
perturb these cells and by perturb I

153
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,400
mean apply a genetic change to this t-

154
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,639
cell such that we shift the distribution

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,199
of t- cell states to favor progenitor

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,000
and affector States however there's many

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,800
genetic perturbations that one could

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
make in te- cells so in our genomes

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,599
there are 20,000 genes roughly and in

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,720
theory then you could make 20,000

161
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,560
perturbations however that's way too

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,919
many to characterize experimentally in

163
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,599
the lab so we need to think of how we uh

164
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,599
tackle such a problem

165
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,130
