1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:23,240
Okay. So last time we were looking at a

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,240
metric space. So this is a metric space.

3
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:34,840
um and we looked at um what we called uh

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,840
open subsets. So open subsets

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:47,800
and so an open subset is so over here is

6
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,800
now a subset of x is set to be open.

7
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,680
If for all

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,229
x in O there exist

9
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,229
[Applause]

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:14,000
are greater than zero. So that the

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,280
entire ball around x is contained in in

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,920
O. Right? And so the picture is that

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:27,280
here you have uh x here you have some

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:33,600
open subset O. And so if for each point

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:37,520
X in O there is an entire ball here

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,560
that is contained in O then O is set to

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,560
be open. Right?

18
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:50,880
What the one of the a few things that we

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:56,079
proved is so one thing we proved

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,079
is that uh that that's uh so again XD is

21
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,399
a metric space

22
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,000
then we defined sorry I should say we

23
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,719
defined the ball

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,160
uh B X

25
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,080
B R of X. So here x is

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,200
in x

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,120
r is some positive number and then this

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:26,959
thing here is then the y

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:31,760
in x such that uh the distance from x to

30
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:37,800
y is strictly less than r.

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,800
And we showed that uh uh P R

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,760
of X is open.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,200
Right? That P R we say also that P R X

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,519
is a ball

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,519
of radius

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,239
R centered at X.

37
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,519
Okay. Now there's a few other things

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,290
that we

39
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,760
discussed.

40
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:19,440
[Applause]

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:22,760
So one thing is that so uh on sets

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,760
on subsets

43
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,200
we have three operations.

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,319
uh one is intersection.

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,599
So this is that if you have if u alpha

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,000
um is a family

47
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,280
of subsets.

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,599
Then we look at the intersection of all

49
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,920
these subsets.

50
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:16,079
And so X is in this intersection

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:19,400
just means that that X is in U alpha for

52
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,400
all alpha.

53
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,960
The second operation we looked at was

54
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,160
union.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,320
And so again u alpha is a family of

56
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,240
subsets. Then we say that x here is in

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,320
the union of the u alpha.

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,320
This is the same as saying that there

59
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,320
exist

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,680
alpha such that

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,800
x is in u alpha.

62
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,840
And the third thing we the third

63
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,440
operation we have is that if you have a

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,160
subset

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,759
capital u

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,759
then uh we have the complement. So the

67
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,759
complement

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,160
of u

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,160
uh is the x

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,199
such that

71
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,960
x is not in in you right that's a

72
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
compliment and so there was these three

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,280
operations

74
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,280
uh on subsets right and why this is

75
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,960
relevant Here

76
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,680
this is relevant because if

77
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,840
uh if u alpha so we have the following

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,840
uh lema

79
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,880
again we have a matrix space here and we

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,880
have o alpha is a family

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
of open subset

82
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,919
of X

83
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,919
then then the union

84
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,280
is also open.

85
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,680
Okay. Now why is this the case?

86
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,479
Well, it's it's a the case because if so

87
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:40,160
if

88
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:45,199
X here is in the union of the O alpha

89
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,880
then this means that there exist

90
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:54,319
alpha such that

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:57,440
X here is in O alpha right but since O

92
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,639
that O alpha is open this means that

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,960
there exist. So not only is X in that

94
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,199
but there exist

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Rh

96
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,560
that depends on X and alpha uh R

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,560
positive so that the whole ball here

98
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,520
such that the whole ball centered at X

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,199
is contained in U alpha O alpha sorry

100
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,680
right but if it's contained in O alpha

101
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,990
then this imply

102
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,990
[Applause]

103
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,680
If it's contained in O alpha

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:45,000
then we have that then this imply that

105
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,000
it's of course this ball here

106
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,680
is contained in the union

107
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,680
of of these guys.

108
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,759
Right? But that's exactly what it means

109
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,759
that to say that the union is open.

110
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,759
Right?

111
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:13,759
The other lema,

112
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:16,560
the other lema uh related to this is

113
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,400
well and there you have to be careful

114
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,520
uh that if you have uh finitely many. So

115
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,520
again you have a metric space

116
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,560
and and O1

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,560
up to O N finally many

118
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,039
uh open subsets.

119
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:52,519
If you have finitely many open subsets

120
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,519
then the intersection of these

121
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,920
is also open.

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:09,360
Okay. Now why is that the case? This is

123
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:14,480
uh this is the case because if you have

124
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,800
so if x here is in the intersection of

125
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,800
these guys

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:28,240
then it means that this is equivalent to

127
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:33,399
saying that x here is in o i for all i

128
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,399
right i = 1 up to n

129
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,720
But then for each but this means

130
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,880
but since

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,880
oi is open then for

132
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,200
for oi there exist a r i. So this means

133
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,440
that since

134
00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:00,880
OI is open,

135
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,399
there exist a R I. So that such that

136
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,560
the ball here

137
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:12,480
with radius X but sorry with radius R

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,600
but center X. This one here is contained

139
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,800
in OI. Right?

140
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,680
This is for each eye. Right? But now if

141
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,480
we take there's only finally many I. So

142
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,480
you can let R

143
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,800
be the minimum of these guys.

144
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,399
Right? If R is the minimum of these guys

145
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,040
then the ball of radius R around X.

146
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,480
These are the points where the distance

147
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,760
is strictly less than R to X. Right? But

148
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:53,839
that is of course contained in BR I of

149
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,560
X. This is for each I you have this. But

150
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:01,279
this one here was supposed to be

151
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,640
contained in OI, right? And so you see

152
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,839
that this ball here,

153
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,640
okay, this ball here is contained in

154
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,640
this for each

155
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,240
for each eye. So this means that this

156
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,839
ball must be contained

157
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,839
in the intersection of these guys.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,279
And I'll just write it out again just

159
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:38,000
emphasizing that I'm only doing this for

160
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,839
finitely many oaks. Okay. So by and

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,120
that's exactly what it means that the

162
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,760
intersection is open. And again you know

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,279
you could draw a little picture here. It

164
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,399
might be helpful to draw a little

165
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,800
picture. You have you know this here is

166
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,680
01.

167
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,240
Here you have O2

168
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,360
and here you have 03.

169
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,160
You have a point in the intersection.

170
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,120
There's a ball here that is contained in

171
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,519
this. There's a ball, another ball here.

172
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,639
So that's contained in this. And there's

173
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,959
a third ball, this ball here. So that's

174
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,000
contained in that. Right? And then you

175
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:22,519
kind of look at the smallest ball, you

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,519
know, you look at the smallest radi

177
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,160
uh and and that ball is then contained

178
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
in in in the intersection of the tree.

179
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,240
And the intersection of the tree is

180
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,240
this. Yeah.

181
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
Okay. Now, why why do we have to be

182
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,040
careful? Let me just remind you. Why do

183
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,240
we have to be careful here?

184
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:54,120
And so the examples example that we

185
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:54,120
looked at last time was that if you take

186
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,720
if you are on

187
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,440
so the example from last time is that if

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,320
x here

189
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:16,320
is a real number

190
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:18,560
and you're looking at O N here is a

191
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
natural number

192
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,399
and you're looking at

193
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,160
that this is this interval here from min

194
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,720
-1 / n to n.

195
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,480
Well, then if you're looking at the

196
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,760
intersection of all of these,

197
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,880
right, the intersection well that's just

198
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,040
that's just a one point

199
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,040
zero, right? And of course zero is not

200
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,839
an open subset, right? Because if it was

201
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,720
an open subset, a whole ball and a ball

202
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,800
here on the line is like a little open

203
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
little interval that doesn't have the

204
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,199
two end points, right?

205
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:07,199
So this here is so note

206
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:11,519
that uh in this example each OI or each

207
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:18,040
O is open

208
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,040
but the intersection of the OS

209
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,320
uh is not open

210
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,279
and the problem again is that there are

211
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:35,040
infinitely many Os right

212
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:38,480
okay now again one of the things we

213
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,240
proved was and

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,120
maybe I was just here uh on that board

215
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,760
uh uh one of the things we proved last

216
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,040
time was that

217
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,639
if you take a ball

218
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,639
then it is actually an open

219
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,839
Let me

220
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,839
let me prove

221
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,839
a

222
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,880
variation of that.

223
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,000
So suppose you're looking at so let's

224
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,560
have a lema here

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,279
that if you have again a metric space

226
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:28,240
here and r here is bigger than zero. Now

227
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,800
let's look at the X and then take away.

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:36,160
But now I'm looking at the set. So let

229
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:40,160
me look at the set Y here. So X

230
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:45,680
X X is some fixed point in this metric

231
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,320
space and you're looking at the Y in X.

232
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,199
So that the distance

233
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:58,279
to X

234
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,279
from Y is strictly bigger than R. Okay.

235
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,279
So in other words, if this here is X,

236
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,040
this is the space X. Here you have the

237
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,480
point X. Then you have here this here

238
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,959
including this the circle here are the

239
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,959
points that have distance at most r from

240
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,600
little x. Then this is this set here

241
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,160
outside

242
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,399
this this disc where the boundary is

243
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,800
included.

244
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,959
So outside.

245
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,920
Okay. And so what I want to prove here

246
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:43,240
is that this here is this here is an

247
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,240
open substring.

248
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,519
And the proof is very similar to how we

249
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,320
proved that a ball is open. Again the

250
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:59,000
key ingredient

251
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,000
is the triangle inequality.

252
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,600
And so

253
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,480
right so let's try to prove that. So,

254
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:26,640
so we take um we take Y here

255
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,199
in this let's call this set something

256
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,199
let's call it E.

257
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,840
So suppose you have X here Y here in E.

258
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,679
So this means that the distance from Y

259
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,679
to X

260
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:49,760
is strictly bigger than R. I want to

261
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,760
prove right. So I have here I have my

262
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,880
picture here.

263
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,320
This is X. This is this ball here and

264
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,760
then I have a Y that lie outside it. And

265
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,039
I want to find a little ball here around

266
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,360
Y that is entirely contained in the

267
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,240
complement of this ball.

268
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,840
And so I do the same that I did last

269
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,640
time. I we set I mean you know almost

270
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,160
the same not exactly the same but so we

271
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,160
set s here equal to right. So the idea

272
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,080
is that you're looking at this distance

273
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:32,559
here. This distance is dx

274
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:35,360
y. This part of it is r, right? And so

275
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,160
you it seems reasonable.

276
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,000
this here, if this picture was right,

277
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:47,039
then this thing here would be

278
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,160
uh s and this s here would be dx

279
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,160
y - r.

280
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,160
So that's what I'm setting uh s equal

281
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
to.

282
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And the first thing I notice that

283
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,200
because this is strictly bigger than r,

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,200
this thing here is strictly positive.

285
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:14,880
And then I take set here in that ball.

286
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,960
Now it's centered at Y. It's have radius

287
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,039
S.

288
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,480
And then I want to look at the distance

289
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,480
to and I want to estimate. So one to

290
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
estimate

291
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,880
to estimate from below

292
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:46,559
uh the distance from X to set right well

293
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,760
the triangle inequality if you just

294
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,919
think about the triangle that's

295
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,559
something like bounding a distance from

296
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,919
above right so if I want to estimate

297
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,400
something below Oh, then basically the

298
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,320
this thing I want to estimate from below

299
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,160
have to be on the other side of the

300
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,480
inequality, right? And so

301
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,120
so how does that work?

302
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,080
So I have

303
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,440
so let's again

304
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,240
draw a little picture to so I have let

305
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,760
me do it little bit on the side. So I

306
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,039
have this ball here

307
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:28,520
and I have this Y here and then I have

308
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,520
the C here

309
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:41,440
and I now want to say I want to estimate

310
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:44,559
so I'm saying that the distance from

311
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,720
uh so so

312
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,720
this is what I want to bound from below

313
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:57,760
And what I know is that this set here

314
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,480
is I know something about the distance

315
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,000
to y, right?

316
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,080
So this here I know, right? And so you

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,320
see this thing here by the triangle

318
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,840
inequality is now bounded by by the

319
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,120
distance

320
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,679
from x to y,

321
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,720
right?

322
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,720
And I know that this thing here is less

323
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,000
or equal to this here is the one I want

324
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,720
to estimate. So I'm just leaving that.

325
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This one here, it's because set is in

326
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,320
the ball of radius s around y. So this

327
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,679
thing here is actually

328
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:43,039
strictly less than

329
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:45,039
s like that. Right?

330
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,799
And so now you can just move this one

331
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,919
here over on the other side and you have

332
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:57,200
that dx

333
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:59,919
y - s is strictly less than d

334
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,000
uh x comma z.

335
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:08,320
Now we have to fill in what s is s is up

336
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,840
there. So this thing here is this this

337
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,440
this this thing here is equal to this is

338
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:20,720
dx. I'm just copying that. But I fill in

339
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:24,200
what s is and s is d xy

340
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,200
minus r.

341
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,799
But you see those two cancel and you're

342
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,120
left with a r. And so you have that r is

343
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,360
strictly less than this which is exactly

344
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,520
what we wanted to prove.

345
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,480
And so again, you know, the the you

346
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,440
know, it was it was almost exactly the

347
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:48,320
same proof that we had to prove that the

348
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,159
ball was open. Um we're just using here,

349
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,480
you know, the thing is what we're using

350
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,280
here is that again we're using that the

351
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,159
triangle inequality is like you're

352
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,240
bounding some distance from above and so

353
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
you kind of have to use it the other

354
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,440
way, right? with having the sinks that

355
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,320
you want to bound from below on the

356
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,320
other side of the inner corner.

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,360
Okay. So the next thing is then and we

358
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,520
talked a little bit about that uh last

359
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,039
time. The next thing is closed subsets.

360
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,280
So this may seem like a triviality

361
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,840
because it's defined

362
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,559
sort of in a way trivially. So what is a

363
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,640
clo but it's actually a really useful

364
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,200
notion

365
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,159
and yeah

366
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,159
uh and so this is

367
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,280
so a subset

368
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,080
C

369
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,080
is set to be closed again X is a metric

370
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,080
space

371
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,480
to be closed

372
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,720
if the complime element

373
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,400
is open.

374
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,080
So that's how you define a closed

375
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,640
subset.

376
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:21,120
And so again as we observed right since

377
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:25,080
since the empty set and

378
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,080
x are both

379
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,320
uh open.

380
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,320
The complement of the empty set is the

381
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,000
whole set. So it means that X and the

382
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,039
complement of the whole set is the empty

383
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:46,120
set. It means that those sets are both

384
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,120
open are also both closed.

385
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Okay.

386
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,640
Now um

387
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,240
right so now there is a

388
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:05,919
another way you could have defined a

389
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,600
close subset another way and this is

390
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,600
because you have the following statement

391
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
here.

392
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,440
So a subset

393
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,200
You have a following theorem

394
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,159
that

395
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:38,600
again you have a metric space

396
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,600
and C here subset of X is closed

397
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,600
if and only if

398
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:54,320
if and only if for all sequences

399
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:57,320
in CN in C. Sorry. If if and only if for

400
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,320
all

401
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
sequences

402
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,400
XN where

403
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,279
where

404
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,360
XN is in C. If you have

405
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:24,440
all sequences

406
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,440
all let's say convergent sequences

407
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,679
so all convergence sequence where the

408
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:40,279
sequence lie in a in in in

409
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,279
C then the limit

410
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,799
X is also

411
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,679
in C.

412
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,799
Okay. So we want so I claim that if you

413
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,960
want to check that a set is closed

414
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,760
instead of checking that a complement is

415
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,600
open you could check that and and this

416
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,640
seems like if you were literally going

417
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,039
to check it right on any given example

418
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,679
explicit example you would never do it

419
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,159
this way but it's very useful for

420
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,720
proving things okay and so the thing is

421
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,200
that instead of proving that a

422
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,039
complement is open. Instead, you could

423
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,000
just prove that whenever you have a

424
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,799
sequence in that set, then then is the

425
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,760
limit also in that set? If that's the

426
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,440
case for all sequences, then the set is

427
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,600
closed, right? And so, so we need to so

428
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,799
let's try to prove that. And again, it's

429
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,200
useful. It's sort of useful, you know,

430
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,679
theoretically, but in practice, this

431
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,279
would be totally

432
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,000
useless.

433
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:01,760
But it is useful to proving things.

434
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,720
And so now why? So we need to there's

435
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,720
two things we need to prove.

436
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,000
And so there's two directions. So assume

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
first

438
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,039
that

439
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,039
um that C is closed

440
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,320
and and let

441
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,720
and let

442
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,039
Xn

443
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,799
in C

444
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,799
be a convergence. in sequence.

445
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,640
We want to show want to show

446
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,360
that

447
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,360
the limit

448
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,360
x is also

449
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,200
in C.

450
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Okay.

451
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,279
Now if

452
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,279
um right if since

453
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,760
um xn converts to x

454
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,120
um then

455
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,840
for all

456
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,760
r greater than zero

457
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,760
there exist

458
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:57,039
uh x n in the ball here

459
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,919
of radius

460
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,559
uh r around x right because it's

461
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:08,559
converging right so this means that that

462
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:13,520
for each uh r you must have this

463
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:19,760
but now you see that um If

464
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:24,520
if X here if X was not in C, right? If X

465
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,520
is not in C, since

466
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,159
C is closed,

467
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,200
the complement

468
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,480
is open.

469
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,640
And so this means that now X here is is

470
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,600
assumed to be in a compliment. But it

471
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:49,360
means that there exists some R. So that

472
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:54,440
the ball here of radius of that R

473
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,440
would be contained in the complement,

474
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,960
right?

475
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,399
But the complement but this means that

476
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:09,600
there is no XN in that ball, right?

477
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,520
Because all of the XN's are in C, right?

478
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,960
And this here is entirely contained in

479
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,880
the complement. Right?

480
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,840
So you see that. So this is the

481
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,559
contradiction right. So if we if it is

482
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,360
closed and you have a convergence

483
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:30,320
sequence that sequence is lying in this

484
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:33,279
closed set then the limit must be um

485
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,440
must be also contained in the set right

486
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,760
because otherwise there would be like

487
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,240
the limit would lie outside and there

488
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,360
would be a little ball centered at that.

489
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,600
So there was no element in the sequence

490
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,320
that was in that ball but then that

491
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,919
sequence couldn't converge to the center

492
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,159
right

493
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,480
and the other thing so this is one

494
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,320
direction the other direction that we

495
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,919
need to prove is that

496
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,440
um

497
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,360
is that if and this is again you know

498
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,840
it's useless

499
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,880
you would never go about to prove that a

500
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,559
set is closed in an example But it is

501
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,240
useful sort of more theoretically.

502
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,120
So suppose you have a set and you knew

503
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,039
that whenever you have a sequence in

504
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,840
that set then the limit that is

505
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,039
convergent then the limit is also in the

506
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,720
set. So, so the next thing, so we also

507
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,080
need

508
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,039
also need

509
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,039
to show the Converse and again the

510
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,039
Converse.

511
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,399
So we need to show

512
00:32:51,120 --> 00:33:00,120
that if that if uh

513
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,120
that if for all sequences

514
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,480
xn

515
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,480
which line see n is convergent

516
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Then

517
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,679
the limit

518
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,159
x is also

519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,640
in C.

520
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,960
Then

521
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,200
C is in fact

522
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,799
closed,

523
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,200
right? So that would be the converse,

524
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,200
right? So we prove if and only if it has

525
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,840
this property.

526
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,720
Okay? So now let's assume that so so so

527
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,039
suppose we have this property that all

528
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,320
convergent sequences

529
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,480
that uh the limit convergence sequence

530
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,679
in the set

531
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,760
then the limit was also in the set. Now

532
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,639
let's prove that the set is closed. So

533
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:19,079
to prove the set is closed, we need to

534
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,079
show that the complement is open. Right?

535
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,599
So we need to show

536
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,079
that the complement here

537
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,079
is open.

538
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,159
So take

539
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,440
X here in the complement

540
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,480
if if

541
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,280
for all

542
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,280
are greater than zero.

543
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,560
Right? So we need to prove we need to

544
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,760
prove that. Sorry. So let me say it like

545
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,760
this. So we take some x and we need to

546
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,760
show

547
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,520
that there exist some are bigger than

548
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,440
strictly bigger than zero. So that this

549
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,880
ball here

550
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,880
is contained in the complement.

551
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,800
Right? That's what we need to prove. We

552
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,920
need to prove this for each x in the

553
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,880
complement. Now suppose that this was if

554
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,880
this was not the case.

555
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Then I can look at for each n then for

556
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,960
each

557
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,760
each natural number here. You can look

558
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,880
at the ball. It's always going to be

559
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,079
centered at this x.

560
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,440
But I'm looking at it with a radi that

561
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:23,040
is smaller and smaller. Right? If for

562
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,359
each n natural number

563
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,640
if that ball was not contained in a

564
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:32,160
complement so this means that for each n

565
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:38,160
you could pick so pick

566
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:40,800
xn in that set so just you just choose

567
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,960
right because we are assuming that the

568
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,599
complement is not closed is not open so

569
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,480
it means that there would be exist a x

570
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,560
so that No ball here

571
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,119
would be entirely in the complement. So

572
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,040
this means that you would that this one

573
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,720
here would not be entirely contained in

574
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,440
complement. So this means that there

575
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,560
would be some XN and this XN here would

576
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,560
actually be in the set C.

577
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Right?

578
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:20,079
But now of course the distance here

579
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,680
from xn to x this distance here is

580
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:27,760
strictly less than 1 / n. So this means

581
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:31,760
that so this imply that the xn converts

582
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,359
to x right and now the assumption was

583
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,880
that whenever you have a sequence that

584
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,760
was converging these guys lie in c then

585
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,800
the limit here also lie in c. So then

586
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,599
you have from the assumption that X here

587
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,880
is in C. But this is the contradiction.

588
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,760
You were assuming that X was not in C.

589
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,520
Right?

590
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,800
Okay.

591
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,800
And again this here is is really really

592
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,160
useful but it's only useful kind of as a

593
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,480
tool to proving things. It's not useful

594
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,800
for checking whether an example is open

595
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,800
or closed.

596
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,320
Um like let me just quickly give you a

597
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,400
couple of examples. Uh probably should

598
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,960
have done that already.

599
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,839
Uh

600
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,640
that if you're looking at

601
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,839
you know so what are closed subsets

602
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,119
right? So closed subset could be you

603
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,119
know so here are some examples closed

604
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,119
subsets.

605
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,520
So if you are if it's an R a closed

606
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,119
subset is like some interval from let's

607
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,839
say from 0 to one where both these

608
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,560
points both zero and one is included.

609
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,320
This here is closed

610
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,560
and why is it closed? because the

611
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,599
complement here is open. It's easy to

612
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:10,560
see that the complement is open. Um

613
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,880
uh something like if you include one of

614
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,400
the endpoint but not the other, this is

615
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,400
neither closed nor open,

616
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,359
right? And and also if you're looking at

617
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,320
like the complement say from zero the

618
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,960
complement of so if you're looking sorry

619
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,560
if you're looking at this thing here uh

620
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:43,320
union with say from two to three this is

621
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,320
also is also closed.

622
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:55,520
Okay. Now uh and and a and uh maybe one

623
00:39:51,599 --> 00:40:00,920
more example is if you just take a

624
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,920
single point this is closed

625
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,280
right and again you just check that the

626
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:12,640
complement is open.

627
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,720
Uh now so now uh

628
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,640
the next thing we talked I think we

629
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,160
talked very briefly about that last time

630
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,560
also because we talked a little bit

631
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:27,160
about closed subset but but so if you

632
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,160
take so you have the following theorem.

633
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,560
So if you have a metric space here

634
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:41,560
and you have a family C alpha of closed

635
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,560
subset

636
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,320
then the intersection of these closed

637
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:56,320
subset

638
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
this here is also closed.

639
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,200
And if you you have just finally many

640
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,200
closed subset

641
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,640
then the union of finitely many closed

642
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,640
subset

643
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,400
is also closed.

644
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,680
Right? And so here it's exactly the

645
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,640
opposite thing as for open sets that you

646
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,240
can take any intersection

647
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,400
and is still closed. But if you take

648
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,720
union you can only do it for finite

649
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,359
many. So this exactly the opposite. Why

650
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,000
is it exactly the opposite? It's because

651
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,920
that in order to prove that something is

652
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,680
closed it means that the complement is

653
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:53,200
open.

654
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:56,720
So and then we have these basic

655
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,800
relations for right. So the proof of

656
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,599
this again.

657
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,599
So the proof of this

658
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,520
and so these were these operations on

659
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,359
set that we went through

660
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,880
that if you take X here and you take the

661
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,599
complement

662
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:22,800
of intersections of subsets right this

663
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:26,599
thing here is the same as the union

664
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,599
of the complements

665
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,720
like that Right? And you see that since

666
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,599
this is closed, this means that the

667
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,000
complement is open and you can take any

668
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,079
union of open sets and is still open. So

669
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,720
that's why you could take any

670
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,640
intersection, right? And so the other

671
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,960
thing is that if you're looking at the

672
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,440
you to prove that this thing here is

673
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,760
closed, then you're looking at the

674
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,760
complement of this union here.

675
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,520
But this thing here is now the

676
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,680
intersection the complement of the

677
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,200
intersection

678
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,200
of uh the C1

679
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,119
uh up to

680
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,960
um sorry this is the complement of the

681
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,599
this is the this is the

682
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,119
Um,

683
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,359
intersection of these guys

684
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,359
like this,

685
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:47,520
right? And you see here since C one up

686
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,000
to CN since they're closed, these guys

687
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,560
here are open. And so you're looking at

688
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,440
finite intersections of open sets and

689
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,079
that's open. Right? So again for closed

690
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,560
sets it's like the in terms of taking

691
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,560
intersection and union it's exactly the

692
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
opposite.

693
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:12,440
Okay. Um now the next thing I want to

694
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,440
talk about is a cover.

695
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:20,640
Um

696
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:24,440
so uh so so you have a metric space. So

697
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,440
the separation is

698
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,720
so we have a matrix space here

699
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:37,480
and we have a subset a here is a subset

700
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,480
of x

701
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,359
and then we have a collection and then u

702
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,720
alpha

703
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,720
is a family of subset

704
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,800
of subsets.

705
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,839
of of x. And we say that

706
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:10,040
that uh that uh u alpha is a cover

707
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,880
of a

708
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:21,480
if

709
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,480
um if a here is contained in the union

710
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,319
of the u alphas.

711
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,839
Sorry. This is what it means to cover.

712
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,839
That's it by a family name.

713
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,839
Um,

714
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,839
a subco

715
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,200
is

716
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,560
right. So if you take imagine that you

717
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:03,520
have the like a whole bunch of sets and

718
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:05,599
together they cover a a subco means that

719
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,880
you don't need to take all of the u

720
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:12,720
alphas if you can just take some of them

721
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,119
and they will still cover it. So is so a

722
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,160
cover is a

723
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,160
a subf family

724
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,520
of the given

725
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,040
family

726
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,599
you alpha

727
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,599
such that the union of those

728
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,040
of those

729
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,640
still cover.

730
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Okay.

731
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,640
So let's look at a couple of examples.

732
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,839
I mean, you know, for if you take a

733
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,880
family that cover something, then the

734
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:14,319
family itself is a subco, but that's a

735
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,200
kind of trivial subco,

736
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,720
right? And so,

737
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,520
um, you could look at so just here as an

738
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,560
example.

739
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,040
Suppose that the metric space is is x

740
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,280
with the usual as sorry with the usual

741
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,880
metric.

742
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,440
And suppose now that the u alpha is

743
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,319
actually u ns and those are interval

744
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,000
from minus n.

745
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,079
Uh let me just make them open. It

746
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,680
doesn't matter you know for a copper

747
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,880
there's no assertion whether they're

748
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:52,160
open or closed or on either. So if

749
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:55,920
you're looking at those sets well if you

750
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:58,640
take the union of all of those sets

751
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,240
that gives you everything. So this

752
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,599
family is a cover of of the real line

753
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:08,800
right? Of course, if you take a proper

754
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,440
sub cover, right? Meaning, right? I

755
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,319
mean, you well, you could take a So,

756
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,400
this here cover all of it. But you see

757
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:21,680
that this particular cover have the

758
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:25,200
property that you n + one, right? This

759
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,760
is contains the previous one,

760
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,839
right? So, you don't really need all of

761
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,920
them to cover R. You could start

762
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,559
if you wanted to. You could start with

763
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,040
at some very large N and then you could

764
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,520
go on from there, right? But you can't

765
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,000
have there wouldn't be finite many of

766
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,640
the UN that would cover, right? You

767
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,480
would you need infinite many to cover,

768
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,359
right? Because otherwise, you know,

769
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:56,000
there would be some sort of last point

770
00:48:51,359 --> 00:49:00,480
in both both in.

771
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:05,359
Okay. So that's a cover and a subco

772
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:08,160
and um an open cover

773
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,480
open

774
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,480
is then

775
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,119
where each

776
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,559
uh u alpha

777
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,559
is an open subset.

778
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:35,440
It's not usually I mean you it's really

779
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,440
this diff that's Yeah.

780
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Um

781
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,200
it

782
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,400
uh so that's a open cover. So each of

783
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,559
the sets that is in the covering has to

784
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,520
be open.

785
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:55,000
And and the last definition we need is a

786
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,000
finite subco

787
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,160
is a cover

788
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,160
is a subco

789
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,559
consisting

790
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,599
of finer many sets.

791
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:31,480
F.

792
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,480
Okay. So that's a finite circle.

793
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:40,079
And so now this leads to uh the and

794
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:44,400
again you know in this example here u an

795
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:49,079
R where this here is a cover there is no

796
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,079
finite. So, so it's a note

797
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:55,480
that this

798
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,480
this particular

799
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,839
this this copper

800
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,839
does not

801
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,680
have a finer subco,

802
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,319
Right? If you just take finitely many of

803
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,880
these, they are not going to cover all

804
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:24,319
of R. Right? But actually in this

805
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,680
example, you see also that the cover is

806
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:30,960
an open cover. Right?

807
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:35,040
Okay. So this now leads to uh the

808
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,040
definition of compactness.

809
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,040
So

810
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,440
you have a metric space

811
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:58,599
So x comma d is a metric space.

812
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,599
A here is a subset and we say

813
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,880
that a is compact.

814
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,920
If

815
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,400
for all

816
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,599
copper

817
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,599
for every sorry let me see if for every

818
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,599
copper

819
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:36,920
of for every open cover.

820
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,920
So if for for every open cover

821
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,960
of a

822
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,960
there is

823
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,839
there is a finite sub cover.

824
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:00,359
Okay, that's that's uh

825
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,359
right

826
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:09,680
now uh and the thing that is really

827
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:14,680
useful

828
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,680
is uh and we won't prove this

829
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:22,000
today but I'll prove it next time.

830
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,000
So this is the following

831
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
result.

832
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:33,480
So so why why is this notion useful?

833
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,200
Right? So one of the key one of the key

834
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,960
property when you're thinking about

835
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:48,640
sequences one of the key property

836
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:51,040
uh was for sequences on the line was the

837
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,040
the cushy convergence theorem and the

838
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,119
cus convergence theorem again said that

839
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,359
whenever you have a cus sequence then it

840
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,680
was automatically convergent and it was

841
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:02,400
often much easier to check that a

842
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,480
sequence was a cus sequence than to

843
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,040
actually find the limit and prove that

844
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,920
it's converging. to that

845
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,240
the but to prove the kushi convergent

846
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,160
theorem we needed the balsano via stress

847
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,880
theorem right and uh so so this is

848
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,599
because so why is it useful this notion

849
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:26,280
of compactness so it's useful because

850
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,280
the there's a metric version

851
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,839
uh version

852
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,200
of the bzano vas I assume

853
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,680
uh for matrix bases

854
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,880
and so this is the following theorem

855
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,599
um and again I won't prove it now but

856
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,800
I'll prove it next time that if you take

857
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:09,599
a matrix case and a here is uh a is a

858
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:14,440
subset

859
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,440
and uh a is compact.

860
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:24,599
Then any

861
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,599
any sequence

862
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,640
in A

863
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,119
has a convergent

864
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,240
subsequence

865
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,359
that's that's right. So remember that

866
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,319
the bulano vis again said that if you

867
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:55,200
take a bounded

868
00:55:50,319 --> 00:56:00,760
uh bounded sequence uh in in I then

869
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,760
there is a subsequence that converge.

870
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:09,760
Okay. Um so now um uh let's prove a few

871
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:14,119
things about

872
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,119
um um

873
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,040
uh right let me also look at a couple of

874
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:22,160
more examples.

875
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:27,119
So, so the first thing I want to just

876
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:29,200
discuss is that so this is like the key

877
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,720
this is our key application of

878
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,799
compactness

879
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:36,440
that you have this metric version of the

880
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,440
balsano vio

881
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,520
and so

882
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,520
um

883
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,799
and now um but let's prove a couple

884
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:54,000
things about

885
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:59,240
compact subsets.

886
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,240
So, so we have a metric space here

887
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:07,280
and I have a here is

888
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,280
a is is

889
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,280
compact.

890
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:19,920
Then I want to show that this implies

891
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:23,160
this implies two things. One is that a

892
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,160
is bounded.

893
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:34,440
And the second one is that a is closed.

894
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,520
Okay.

895
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,520
Let's prove first that a is bounded.

896
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Well,

897
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,319
you could Yeah. No. Uh, you could look

898
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,799
at

899
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:07,720
So, you could look at a very trivial

900
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:07,720
cover of A. So,

901
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:13,839
so you have here A.

902
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,760
Well, obviously

903
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:21,280
if you take all balls,

904
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:26,480
let's say with radius one and you take

905
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:31,200
all balls, but now the center here

906
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:34,720
is could be anything in A, right? For

907
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:38,799
each element in A, you take a ball of

908
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:40,720
radius one around that point.

909
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:44,559
But that's first of all these balls are

910
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:47,200
all open and of course this thing here

911
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,040
the union of these guys well the union

912
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,920
contained in particular all the centers

913
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,520
but the centers is already a so you

914
00:58:51,920 --> 00:59:00,520
trivially have this right

915
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,520
now since a is compact

916
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,520
this means that a must be That's these

917
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,079
are this is an open cover. So it means

918
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,160
that's finitely many of them already

919
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:21,079
cover

920
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,079
a. So you have finally many

921
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,720
like this. Okay.

922
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,760
But now I claim that this automatically

923
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,440
implies that A is bounded because you

924
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,119
see

925
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:41,920
you have all these balls here

926
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:45,200
and A is somehow contained in the union

927
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,000
of these guys, right? So this means that

928
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:51,200
for any element. So this means that for

929
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:56,240
any x. So

930
00:59:51,200 --> 01:00:00,880
if x here is in

931
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:04,960
um is in a then there exist

932
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:07,760
one of these finitely many i where i is

933
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,480
one of these finitely many. So that the

934
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,799
distance

935
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:16,000
to this x i

936
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:18,960
is smaller than one. Right?

937
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:23,760
We would like to say that a is contained

938
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:29,720
in a large ball. Right? So now

939
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,720
and that right. So, and now

940
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:43,200
now you just take the, you know, you

941
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,119
pick one of these X eyes. Let's pick the

942
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:49,280
first one.

943
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:51,359
And let's look at the um let's look at

944
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,240
the maximum

945
01:00:51,359 --> 01:01:00,280
of these uh

946
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,280
the from the first one to the other one

947
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:08,400
and let's add one to that

948
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:11,760
right that you take maximum over finite

949
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,960
many numbers. So this is a nice finite

950
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,440
not many numbers and this here is you

951
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:21,280
call this here R.

952
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,240
Now you look at the ball of radius R

953
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:27,520
around X1

954
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:33,240
and I want to show that any X. So want

955
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:33,240
to show that. So want to show

956
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,680
that for any

957
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:50,000
x in a

958
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:53,240
then we have that x is in this bowl

959
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,240
like that.

960
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,839
Okay.

961
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:22,720
So um right so now we know that so since

962
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,920
since x here is we know that x is

963
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:29,760
contained in the union of these ball. So

964
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:34,280
we know that x is contained in this ball

965
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,280
here for some i.

966
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,760
where where it's one of these little n

967
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,520
many mini eyes,

968
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:48,559
right? So this means now that the

969
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:51,760
distance and so you know that the

970
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:56,160
distance to this

971
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:58,240
little i is at most one, right? And so

972
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,160
now if you're looking at the distance

973
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:06,799
from x to the first one then this here

974
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:11,440
is less than the distance from

975
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:15,119
uh this to x i plus the distance this is

976
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:17,039
the triangle inequality again x i maybe

977
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:21,280
let me just make very clear that this is

978
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:24,079
the first one to the first one right

979
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:28,079
this is the triangle inequality

980
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:32,960
right But these distances here

981
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:35,960
are right this here plus

982
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,960
this

983
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,160
uh is um

984
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:46,240
right so this here is so sorry this

985
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:49,039
thing here is bounded by one right it's

986
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:52,319
actually strictly less than one

987
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:55,880
so this here is less than one plus

988
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,880
this thing here

989
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,960
and you see this thing here is of course

990
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:06,559
this is how we define R. This is

991
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:10,400
strictly uh this is actually uh less or

992
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:14,000
equal to r and so you have that this

993
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,880
thing here is strictly less than r and

994
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,880
that's what we wanted to prove.

995
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,280
Okay so this prove that if you take a

996
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,520
again a metric space and you have a

997
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,240
compact subset then it's automatically

998
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,559
bounded.

999
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:36,000
What about the second one? Suppose you

1000
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:38,480
take a a subset is it closed?

1001
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,480
Now let's use the theorem that we just

1002
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,480
proved.

1003
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,079
So we need to prove

1004
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:08,520
Okay. So let's prove that that this A

1005
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,520
here is closed.

1006
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:30,760
Okay. So now if A is closed. So to prove

1007
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,760
that A is closed

1008
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,559
by the theorem we've just we proved just

1009
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,559
a little while ago.

1010
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:52,599
Theorem we proved earlier.

1011
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,599
We showed earlier.

1012
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,920
uh we need to show

1013
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,680
that if xn is a sequence

1014
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:14,119
sequence in a and xn is converging to

1015
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:14,119
some x we need to show need to show

1016
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:23,240
that x is also in a

1017
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,240
Fine.

1018
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,240
Suppose not.

1019
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,280
Suppose not. We want to show that this

1020
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:45,079
leads to a contradiction.

1021
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,079
We want to get a contradiction.

1022
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,760
So you have you have this x here and

1023
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:05,680
you're assuming that x is not in a

1024
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:07,520
but you yet you have a sequence in in a

1025
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:11,039
that somehow

1026
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,520
tend to tend to this

1027
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:16,480
um this is the sequence xn and it's

1028
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,480
tending to this element

1029
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,720
Well,

1030
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,799
we saw earlier that we've defined

1031
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,559
something called

1032
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:35,760
we def e

1033
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:39,599
here which is the x the y

1034
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:45,039
in x. So that the distance

1035
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:47,760
from X to Y is strictly bigger than R.

1036
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:50,079
Then we saw that this here is an open

1037
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,760
set. Right? We show that this here is

1038
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:55,440
open.

1039
01:07:51,760 --> 01:08:01,359
This is for each R.

1040
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:04,000
So I'm going to now find a cover

1041
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:07,520
of of A. I'm going to find an open

1042
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,160
cover. And the open comma is that for

1043
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:13,520
each integer,

1044
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:17,520
for each n here,

1045
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:20,640
I'm going to look at e

1046
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,759
1 / n. So this means that I'm looking at

1047
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:28,719
the set at the y.

1048
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:31,839
So that the distance from y to this this

1049
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:35,920
x here that I want to show is in a that

1050
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:40,759
these things here is bigger.

1051
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,759
than 1 / n. Okay.

1052
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,719
But now I claim that a here

1053
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,120
is contained

1054
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:54,679
in the union

1055
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,679
of these guys,

1056
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,080
right?

1057
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:03,759
Because you see these guys actually

1058
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,440
these these guys here if you have

1059
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:10,239
something

1060
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:13,040
that is not in any of these right

1061
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:14,880
this means that the that this inequality

1062
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,400
fails

1063
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:23,520
with each n but this means that so if x

1064
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:25,600
here if sorry it's set is is not is in

1065
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,600
the complement of the union of these

1066
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Nice.

1067
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:35,199
Then actually then you have that this

1068
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:42,359
thing here

1069
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:42,359
is less or equal to 1 / n for all n

1070
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:49,520
right you have that that's a complement

1071
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:51,600
right of the union but if it's less than

1072
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:55,040
one n for all n it means that it must be

1073
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,159
zero right so it must be so it means

1074
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,640
that this distance here so you conclude

1075
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:03,199
that this distance

1076
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:07,520
is zero. But this means that this set

1077
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:10,800
here is actually your x, right?

1078
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,920
So the complement of these guys,

1079
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,560
the complement of this union here is

1080
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:20,239
simply just the point x. But you were

1081
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:23,199
assuming that x was not in your set a,

1082
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,360
right? The complement here, the union of

1083
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:28,400
these guys. We have proved now that the

1084
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:31,600
union cover everything

1085
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,840
but x. So in particular it cover a

1086
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:37,199
because we're assuming that little x was

1087
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,800
not in a right.

1088
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:44,400
Okay.

1089
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:47,199
So so this is a nice open cover of a

1090
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:50,000
but a was supposed to be compact. It

1091
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:52,560
means that finally many of these cover,

1092
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:58,400
right?

1093
01:10:52,560 --> 01:11:01,520
But now this family has this property

1094
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:05,040
family has this property

1095
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:11,440
that you see these guys here. If you're

1096
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:13,600
looking at E 1 / N, this thing here is

1097
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:18,800
contained in

1098
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:21,920
E 1 / N + one. Right? If this number

1099
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:25,679
here is smaller, then it means that this

1100
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:29,280
set here is larger. Right?

1101
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:34,320
So you have this. And so you see that if

1102
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:39,719
finitely many if a here was contained in

1103
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,719
finitely many of these guys here.

1104
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:54,560
If it was containing a union of finally

1105
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:57,679
many then you just take the one of these

1106
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:00,960
ni that is the largest right. So this

1107
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,640
means that a here would be contained in

1108
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:08,159
some

1109
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:09,920
one over of some n some for some i right

1110
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:12,239
because there's one of these numbers

1111
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:17,360
these nis that would be the largest

1112
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:20,960
right but this means that this means now

1113
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:23,760
that a right that there is some lower

1114
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:29,199
bound for the distance

1115
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:32,960
to x in A right it doesn't there's no

1116
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:36,159
elements that is so this means that that

1117
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:39,400
this means that there exist there does

1118
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,400
not exist

1119
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,600
let me say for all

1120
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,880
for all

1121
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,920
y in a

1122
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:56,239
then the distance here

1123
01:12:51,920 --> 01:13:00,560
from y to x

1124
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:03,920
is strictly bigger than one over this n

1125
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,440
I right this is just some fixed number

1126
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,320
right this is obviously you know right

1127
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:14,080
but this means that you can't have a

1128
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:17,600
sequence in a that is converging to x

1129
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,560
right because they they all stay away

1130
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:24,400
from from x right they stay a certain

1131
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:27,440
positive distance away from from x so

1132
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:31,880
this means And so this is the desired

1133
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,880
contradiction. Therefore

1134
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,520
there is no sequence

1135
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,440
no sequence

1136
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:52,080
except that converts to X and the XN

1137
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:54,719
RNA. But that's what we assumed in the

1138
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:57,040
beginning, right? We assume we just we

1139
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:02,719
wanted to check that whenever you have a

1140
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:05,840
sequence in in a n that is converging

1141
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,760
then the limit was also right. So so

1142
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,199
that was supposed to have been such a

1143
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,199
sequence. So that's a desired

1144
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,159
contradiction.

1145
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:18,320
So this prove this proof that if you

1146
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:21,360
take a compact metric space then if you

1147
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,480
take a a a metric space and if you take

1148
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:28,320
a compact subset the compact subset

1149
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:31,840
could of course be all of X that's fine.

1150
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:34,080
Um but if you take but I want to allow

1151
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,560
more generally that just to say that

1152
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,920
just having a subset that is compact

1153
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:44,120
this means that it's bounded and closed.

1154
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,120
If you are in Rn

1155
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:51,520
so you have a theorem and we'll talk

1156
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:53,600
about that next time also

1157
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,440
that there's a theorem that say the

1158
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,960
converse is the case but that is not

1159
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,719
actually

1160
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:05,040
that does not generalize to metric

1161
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:07,199
spaces. So it's a theorem here.

1162
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,080
Well, I mean it does generalize but not

1163
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:13,920
like this. It's not that this particular

1164
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:17,600
statement is does not hold.

1165
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,679
So uh so in

1166
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:22,239
Rn

1167
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,920
with the usual metric say the usual

1168
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:26,880
ukidian metric if you will you can just

1169
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:33,679
think about R.

1170
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:37,080
If a here is comp is closed

1171
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,080
and bounded

1172
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,679
then a is is compact.

1173
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,480
Okay.

1174
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,960
uh and uh I wanted to talk about an

1175
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:55,600
example but I don't think I I have

1176
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:59,440
enough time to

1177
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:01,600
uh to to actually talk about that. Let's

1178
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,280
talk about this. Return to this next

1179
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,880
time

1180
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:09,239
uh because we only have four minutes

1181
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,239
left. uh

1182
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,920
and

1183
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:21,719
and um and so instead let's prove

1184
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,719
a theorem here

1185
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,880
that if we take the theorem

1186
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:34,080
if you have a metric space

1187
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,080
a here is a subset of x is compact

1188
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:44,719
Suppose that C here is a subset of A and

1189
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:49,040
C here is right. So this is of course in

1190
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:51,760
X. So C is also a subset of X and C is

1191
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,280
closed.

1192
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,640
Then

1193
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:59,640
the claim is that then C is also

1194
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,640
compact.

1195
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,600
Right? And we have three minutes and we

1196
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:08,960
don't need three minutes because it's

1197
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:12,800
actually very quick. Um and so the thing

1198
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:16,880
is so proof of this so C here is assumed

1199
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,480
to be uh closed. So so this means that

1200
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:22,120
since

1201
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,120
C is closed

1202
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:28,480
this means that the complement of C

1203
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,960
is open.

1204
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,960
Right?

1205
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,040
So now

1206
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:40,880
uh so now let's

1207
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,640
let u that o alpha

1208
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,960
be

1209
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,960
a copper

1210
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:53,440
of c

1211
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:56,320
then we can so o alpha is a copper of c

1212
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,400
and now you can add the complement of c

1213
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:02,960
to it.

1214
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:06,800
So if you're looking at C,

1215
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:12,960
so C here is now of course

1216
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:17,040
uh you C here. So in fact a here

1217
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:21,199
you can think about a as so a is clearly

1218
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:28,080
contained in c

1219
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:31,760
uh union with the complement of c

1220
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:35,280
and so this means that a here

1221
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:39,280
the o alpha cover c. So this is

1222
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:44,159
contained in a union of O alpha union

1223
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:47,120
with this last set right.

1224
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:50,080
These guys are assumed to be open. This

1225
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,480
here is open because c is closed. So

1226
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:56,400
this means that you have now a is

1227
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:58,480
contained in this is an open cover of a.

1228
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,280
So this means that finitely many of

1229
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:05,840
these right. So this means that A is

1230
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:08,239
contained in like O1 union up to some O

1231
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:11,920
N. And then quite possibly you would

1232
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:14,880
also need this one here.

1233
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:17,840
But now you see but C here is contained

1234
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,719
in here. So this means that C is

1235
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,760
contained in this. This here was not

1236
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:26,320
part of the cover. But it's not needed

1237
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:30,640
if you just want to cover C because none

1238
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:33,520
of these elements cover anything in C.

1239
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:37,760
Right? So this implies that C actually

1240
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:40,000
must be contained in O1 union up to O N

1241
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:43,199
because this here does not cover

1242
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:49,560
anything in C. So this proved right that

1243
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:49,560
C there was a finite subco that cover C.
