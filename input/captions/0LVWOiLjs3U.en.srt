1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,160
everybody looking forward to chatting

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,839
with you guys all today um and thank you

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,320
so much for having me so I'm Daphne I'm

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,599
the CEO of here on AI and I really

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
believe that companies like yours with

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,400
all of these resources affect change on

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,840
a global scale really every single day

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,119
but are the resources that you guys have

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,680
being utilized as effectively as they

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,720
possibly could well what if I were to

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,359
tell you that in the next decade over

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,200
75% of accounting professionals plan to

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,399
retire and I'm sure many of us probably

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,800
rely on accountants anybody here for

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,480
strategic growth reporting end of month

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,079
yeah me too um and so really what is

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,520
going to happen is because there are so

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,920
many people who are planning to retire

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,039
this is going to leave a very large gap

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,280
in business analytics and let me give

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,680
you a quick example Steve is a VP at a

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,000
Fortune 100 company with over 200 staff

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
underneath him and he handles about 500

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
million dollars in business every single

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,880
year but Steve still relies on Legacy

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,799
software and also Excel um and Steve has

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,200
a bunch of people that he has dedicated

28
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,880
to keeping the financials on track but

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,640
even still he finds that it can take

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,200
anywhere from two months to four months

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,439
to prepare the reports that he needs for

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
uh some important meetings and this all

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,680
culminates where um his team gives him a

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
5 inch thick binder with 150 different

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,479
tabs and a one-day meeting where where

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,240
the CEO flies down over a hundred

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,000
different um senior Executives sit down

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,640
together and go line by line through

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,200
this to make decisions that take months

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,240
to implement does this sound familiar to

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
anybody I know that when I started my

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,439
first company it was really all too

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,600
familiar for me I was generating

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,560
literally gigabytes of data every single

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,799
day to evaluate the health of my

46
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,520
business things that were more or less

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,200
pretty simple like cash flow statements

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
piano all those things but then things

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,240
that were more complicated like board

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,719
reports scenario analysis and things

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,600
like this and it took too much time I

52
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,959
honestly felt a little bit overwhelmed

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,239
by the amount of data that we were

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,400
collecting and I actually have a PhD in

55
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,920
this stuff and even after we did all

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,680
this it still took a lot of time to

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,640
actually Implement these

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,800
decisions so I did what any sane person

59
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,040
would do and I spent months building my

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,959
own system and yes it is okay to laugh

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,080
and with this new system not only could

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,040
we actually provide a client portal so

63
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,760
our own clients could come in and look

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,920
at their data and strategic plans that

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,160
we had built for them but now we could

66
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,319
actually use the data that we had to

67
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Spotlight were there any areas for

68
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,360
improvements could we utilize our

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
resources any better in terms of

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
potentially maybe we could reduce

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,080
dependencies or diversify our income

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,319
streams and we could actually do this

73
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,159
now in terms of minutes rather than

74
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,680
months today we call this hereon Ai and

75
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,239
we used Advanced machine learning

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,959
algorithms to dive deep into your data

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,879
and our co-pilot is one of the most

78
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,400
intuitive real-time analytic tools that

79
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,560
is currently available on the market and

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,560
this gives um intuitive and Powerful

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,599
analytics that provide instant

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,480
understanding of your data so Steve

83
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,920
switched over to our co-pilot he was

84
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,959
able to connect a bunch of his different

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,000
applications that he uses as well as any

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,640
of his Excel sheets that his team was

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
using and he was able to get instant

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,040
insights and this was relevant in terms

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,799
of Revenue inventory accounts receivable

90
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,959
better estimates of his burn and was

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,120
able to do this in literal seconds

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,040
versus months so we know right now that

93
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,680
81% of Corporations still use Legacy

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,840
software and Excel in some sort of

95
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,439
capacity and if you're like me or if

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,439
you're like Steve and you want this to

97
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,799
be done instantly rather than in a few

98
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,599
months especially for the critical

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,640
information that you guys need to make

100
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:59,040
these data driven decisions then uh feel

101
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,519
free to use my email send me an email

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
and I'm happy to kind of talk through

103
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,079
this with you guys so you can optimize

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,879
every opportunity for growth and value

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,640
creation thanks

106
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,200
everybody D thank you so much um and

107
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,239
again please post your questions in the

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,079
Q&A Tab and indicate the startup that

109
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,239
it's for so um two key important things

110
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,919
security and confidentiality how do you

111
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,800
handle that a little more if you could

112
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,400
expand on that yeah super important so

113
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,360
especially because we focus on financial

114
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,680
analytics uh we're we're actually in the

115
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,000
middle of sock 2 type 2 um certification

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,160
right now so we are about to have our

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,400
certification probably by December of

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,680
this year um and already we are about

119
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,080
90% compliant with h sock2

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,680
currently great thank you and how

121
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,680
customizable is here on AI for specific

122
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,440
Industries yeah it's a really good

123
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,960
question um so actually the way that we

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,280
have built here on AI we actually do a

125
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,479
lot of fine-tuning based on company

126
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,840
specific data so although right now

127
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,600
we're pretty specific for companies that

128
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,199
that have a Reliance on accounting firms

129
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,160
but actually because of the way that the

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,479
infrastructure is built based on the

131
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,280
data that you have provided for us our

132
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,720
system will be able to learn from that

133
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,160
data and be specific to the insights

134
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,800
that you're looking for so for example

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,919
if this was um manufacturing or

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,600
something along those lines based on the

137
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,720
data that we're providing Ed we could be

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,440
very specific for manufacturing or for

139
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,919
accounting and just quickly

140
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,800
um uh how is it similar or different

141
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,240
from the Microsoft uh co-pilot um yeah

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,479
you must get that all the time I love

143
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,319
that question so it's a great question

144
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:52,919
and if anybody hasn't read um Microsoft

145
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,280
recently put out a document maybe a

146
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,520
month ago at this point of the Microsoft

147
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,440
llm and how it actually goes through and

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,400
analyzes data in its spreadsheet um and

149
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,080
one of the super exciting things is that

150
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,639
we have actually compared our pilot to

151
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,199
their pilot and we're actually faster

152
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,280
and more accurate we're about 16% more

153
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,759
accurate currently than the Microsoft

154
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,680
co-pilot so absolutely makes a lot of

155
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,319
sense to come and hang out with us

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,720
before thinking about

157
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,720
Microsoft okay thank you
