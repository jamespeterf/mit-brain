1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,960
all right um today we are going to move

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,519
on to really we'll sort of start the

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,640
second half of the course the first half

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,480
of the course was about essentially

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,199
following up on lecture one and deriving

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,399
domain and Supply curves so you now know

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,800
um and and have been painfully tested on

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,640
how you can come up with demand and

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,680
Supply curves on how you can take the

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,200
Primitives of consumer preferences and

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,960
the perimeters of production functions

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,039
and come up with demand and Supply

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,360
curves how you can use those to draw

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,559
positive as well as normative

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,039
conclusions about welfare and how that

16
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:55,199
works with different kinds of Market

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,760
structure be it perfect competition

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,920
Monopoly or oligopoly and that is sort

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,680
of the basics of consumer and producer

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,680
Theory the second half of the course is

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,000
essentially applications of that model

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
to various questions that you might have

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,600
raised as we were thinking through the

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,240
basics so for example the next two

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,560
lectures three lectures will be about

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,920
Factor demand Factor markets and in

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,400
particular we're not just going to take

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,560
W and R as given but ask where do W and

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
R come from where where does the wage

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,439
rate and the rate of return on Capital

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,560
actually come from we just took those as

32
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,840
constants and we did producer Theory I

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,880
just gave them to you but now we're

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
going to actually derive where do we

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,719
actually get the wage rate and the

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,880
interest rate so as we're going to go

37
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,960
back once again to the basic model but

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,799
dive more

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,119
deeply okay and in doing so we're going

40
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,600
to get introduced to two new fields of

41
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,079
Economics one is the field of labor

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,439
economics which is the study of Labor

43
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,560
markets

44
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,920
and one is finance which is a study of

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,920
capital markets so we'll learn about two

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,480
exciting new areas of economics in the

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,319
context of understanding Factor

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,760
markets okay so we're going to start by

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,720
talking and by factors once again we

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
mean capital and labor obviously in the

51
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,280
real world there are many factors of

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,120
production we're going to simplify them

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,959
into two as we've been doing so far

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,160
which is capital and

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,280
labor the basic theory of factor demand

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,120
applies to both so I'm going to teach

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,440
Factor demand independently of capital

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,360
and labor then I'm going to come back

59
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,080
and teach labor Supply and then Capital

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
Supply so Factor demand so demand for

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,400
both labor and capital it's the same

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
model but labor Supply and capital

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,800
Supply are different models so I'll

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,400
teach them separately okay so where does

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Factor demand come

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,040
from well let's start with labor demand

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,560
although Capital demand and be symmetric

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,599
let's start with labor demand and let's

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,040
ask

70
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,040
for a firm deciding whether to employ

71
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,040
the marginal unit of Labor they have to

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,959
consider the costs and the benefits of

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,440
that marginal unit of

74
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,200
Labor so what is the cost of a marginal

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,920
unit of Labor well the cost of marginal

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,319
labor the marginal cost of a unit of

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Labor is the

78
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,840
wage that's what it costs you to have

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,360
the marginal unit of Labor okay you have

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
to pay if you want to hire one more hour

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,000
of Labor you got to pay the wage for

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,840
that

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
hour what's the marginal

84
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,519
benefit well the marginal benefit has

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,080
two components first of all the marginal

86
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,360
benefit depends on the marginal product

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,879
of

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,400
labor if you hire one more unit of Labor

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,920
how many more Goods will you

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,079
produce okay so the cost is what it is

91
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,239
the wage the benefits of marginal

92
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,439
product labor we can't stop

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,360
there because first firms don't care

94
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,159
about units of goods firms care about

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,519
Revenue so the marginal benefit of

96
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:14,079
hiring another unit of Labor is the

97
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:17,000
product of the marginal product of labor

98
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,120
times the marginal revenue of one more

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
unit of

100
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,280
good so if I hire one more unit of

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,440
Labor I get one more unit of output and

102
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,800
then that output itself has a marginal

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
revenue so think about the simple case

104
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,960
think about this in a perectly

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,360
competitive market in a perectly

106
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,880
competitive market then the marginal un

107
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,000
of Labor is marginal product of labor

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,479
times the

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,600
price so what's another unit of Labor

110
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,400
worth it's worth how much that worker

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
could produce at times how much I could

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,960
sell it

113
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,160
for so it so the in a perfectly

114
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,360
competitive

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,639
market the marginal BF equals the

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,000
marginal product of labor times price so

117
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,160
essentially what this says for the

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,800
competitive market

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,000
if you set marginal benefits equal the

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,320
marginal costs you want to set the

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,360
marginal product of labor times the

122
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,800
price equal to the

123
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,199
wage and that's how you decide how many

124
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,720
workers to hire you basically hire

125
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,319
workers until their

126
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,199
benefits which is the value of what they

127
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,639
produce equals their cost which is their

128
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,479
wage okay once again pretty

129
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,479
straightforward when you when you think

130
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,919
about it so basically the value of a

131
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,759
worker is determined by how productive

132
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,680
that workers or how many units she can

133
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,360
make times what those unit sell for

134
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,400
another hour of Labor making computer

135
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680
chips is more valuable than an hour of

136
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,080
Labor making potato chips because

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,880
computer should sell for more for more

138
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,720
than potato chips okay so basically the

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
labor you produce is more valuable if

140
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
the good sell for a higher price a great

141
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,360
way to illustrate this and I'm sorry for

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,560
my Pro Sports bias here um is to think

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,960
about basketball players okay think

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,720
about the National Basketball

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,240
Association um as a set of you know a

146
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,599
set of firms that are trying to deliver

147
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,360
the best basketball products so you're a

148
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:21,560
firm you're a team in the

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,720
NBA and you are trying to figure out how

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,000
to set your

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,080
payroll to maximize profits you're

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,240
trying to decide who to hire on your

153
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,880
team you have 12 slots you're trying to

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,720
deire who in those 12 slots you want to

155
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,080
hire to maximize your

156
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,319
profits okay so what you really want is

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,639
you want to ask well what's the marginal

158
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,000
product of the next

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,280
player times the value of that product

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,160
well the marginal product is the number

161
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,160
of wins they produce so you want to ask

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,919
how many wins will a player add to my

163
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,759
team and the value is how much more

164
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,680
money I'll make per win they

165
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,000
add okay the worst basketball teams do

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
not make as much money as the best

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,240
basketball

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,919
teams so basically by hiring a player

169
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,879
I'm asking how much will that player

170
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,400
include increase my wins that's their

171
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,759
marginal product and what's the value of

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,720
a win the price effectively is how much

173
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,520
profit I'll make per additional

174
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,280
win and that's the marginal product of

175
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,520
the additional basketball

176
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,520
player okay so for example LeBron James

177
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,720
makes about $32 million a year LeBron

178
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,599
James is the best you know not so the

179
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,280
best player right now but over the last

180
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,639
20 years the best player in basketball

181
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,840
some would argue the best ever he makes

182
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,440
about $32 million a year okay it's a lot

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,080
of money because his marginal product is

184
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,879
enormous he's a great player and the

185
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,039
additional wins are valuable in terms of

186
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,680
additional advertising attendance

187
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,080
Etc now other players don't make as much

188
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,080
how many of you have heard of Nate

189
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,879
Robinson okay good I always like to see

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
okay mostly gender biased I saw one

191
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,599
woman shake her head hopefully there's

192
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,159
more okay sorry sorry for the gender

193
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,720
biased example but Nate Robinson is one

194
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,759
of the shortest players in NBA history

195
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,639
was 5'9 shorter than me uh in a world

196
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,919
where the typical player about

197
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,639
6667 so he's one of the shortest players

198
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,159
in NBA history but an excellent player

199
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,879
played for a number of teams um very

200
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,200
exciting player but but no LeBron James

201
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,760
let's put it that way by the end of his

202
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,680
career he wasn't great he made about two

203
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,440
million a year you know not bad we'd all

204
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,039
take it but not LeBron James okay he

205
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,919
made about two million a year why did he

206
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,160
make two million a year Well a win was

207
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,880
still worth a win but his marginal

208
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,160
product was low Nate Robinson

209
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,080
contributed less to a win than did

210
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,880
LeBron James Nate Robinson then quit the

211
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,120
NBA he went to play basketball in Israel

212
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,320
Israel's basketball crazy they love

213
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
basketball they have their own league

214
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,760
and in Israel he was a superstar he was

215
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
one of the best players he had maybe the

216
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,519
highest marginal product in the league

217
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,600
because he was so much better than the

218
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,040
other players over there he could

219
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
massively contribute to

220
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,200
wins and his salary went down from 2

221
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,399
million to

222
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,279
300,000 why well his marginal product

223
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,600
went up but the value of a win went way

224
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,800
down okay if you add wins in the US

225
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,800
that's billions of dollars of

226
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,800
advertising revenue or attendance

227
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,279
Revenue in Israel it's not such a big

228
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,480
deal so here's an example where marginal

229
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,680
product went

230
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,120
up but the benefit of hiring went down

231
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,600
and we call that benefit marginal

232
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,279
revenue

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,800
product marginal revenue product is the

234
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,320
marginal product times how much it's

235
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,959
worth Nate Robinson in

236
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Israel was worth less a ticket in Israel

237
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,440
the highest price ticket in Israel is

238
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,480
$75 the highest price ticket in the US

239
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,279
for regular season game court side for

240
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,040
the Boston Celtics is about $2,000

241
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,920
okay so basically this wasn't that much

242
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,880
money made from Israel from basketball

243
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,160
Israel z a robbit had a higher marginal

244
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,120
product he had a lower marginal revenue

245
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,040
product which is why he was paid less

246
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,800
okay so that sort of

247
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,920
illustrates the important distinct

248
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,040
between marginal product and marginal

249
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,240
revenue

250
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,240
product okay questions about that yeah

251
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,320
well the firm it's this is a positive

252
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,519
statement on normative we want is a

253
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,200
normative statement The Firm when they

254
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,440
optimize they set for optimization

255
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,880
involves setting marginal benefits equal

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,880
to Marginal costs in every state of the

257
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,600
world optimization for consumers

258
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,880
optimization for firms I just said well

259
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
instead of deriving this you could

260
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,680
derive this also from firm optimization

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,120
I just did a shortcut I said the

262
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,519
marginal benefit of hiring another unit

263
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,040
of Labor is this the marginal cost is

264
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,240
this you set them equal that's the firm

265
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,240
optimization decision

266
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,320
okay all right now that's labor demand

267
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:14,720
Capital demand looks exactly the

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,680
same the only the cost for Capital the

269
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,560
marginal cost is the rental rate what a

270
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,880
cost for rental unit of

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,200
capital the marginal

272
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
benefit is the marginal revenue product

273
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,279
of capital which is the marginal product

274
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,320
of capital times marginal

275
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,120
Revenue that's the

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,519
benefit now this is just harder to

277
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,279
theoretically we're

278
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,600
done conceptually it's a little harder

279
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,440
for two reasons first of all as I said

280
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,560
it's hard to think about Capital as

281
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,720
having a wage rate but once again we

282
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,639
think about Capital think about renting

283
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,880
a machine every period so our just like

284
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,040
hiring a workers essentially renting the

285
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,440
worker we think of hiring a machine is

286
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,480
renting the machine and we'll come back

287
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,320
to that but R is the price but all hard

288
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,200
to think what's mpk what's a marginal

289
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,720
product of capital well it's just what

290
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
the next unit of capital produce in

291
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,040
terms of outputs it's the same as

292
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,760
workers it's just if you have one more

293
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,120
incremental unit of machine that costs R

294
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,079
how much does that increment your

295
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,360
quantity just like if you have one more

296
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
unit of Labor the cost W how much does

297
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,040
that increment your quality so it's just

298
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,880
like the

299
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,600
MPL it's the effective quantity of the

300
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,839
marginal additional

301
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,199
unit in this case of capital okay

302
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,240
questions about

303
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:42,800
that okay that's all pretty

304
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,320
straightforward the more interesting

305
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,639
part of today's

306
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,680
lecture is thinking about the supply

307
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,560
side and we're going to start today with

308
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,560
labor

309
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,920
Supply we'll do that for about a lecture

310
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,920
and a half and then next time we'll

311
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:00,040
start on Capital Supply so let's talk

312
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,519
about Labor Supply this is

313
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,279
both some fun economics and some

314
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,040
relevant economics because you guys have

315
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,360
to decide how hard to work labor Supply

316
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,040
is fundamentally your decision of how

317
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,880
hard to work now your decision has many

318
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,399
components there's whether you work

319
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,040
there's how many hours you work there's

320
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,639
how hard you work every hour there's

321
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,079
which job you take lots of components

322
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,120
okay we're going to simplify things here

323
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,760
into one decision which is how many

324
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,600
hours you work

325
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,839
okay so imagine you're sort of

326
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,920
deciding um you're you're going to work

327
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,120
just deciding how many hours to work and

328
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,000
we're also going to assume you can

329
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,440
choose it freely obviously in many jobs

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
you can't freely choose your hours your

331
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,320
employer has a role we're going to

332
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,360
assume you choose it

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
freely okay so we are going to do we're

334
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,079
going to think about you forget all the

335
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,399
other decisions you make about what job

336
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,120
you're going to take and hard how how

337
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,800
much effort you're going to put in just

338
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
think about you deciding how many hours

339
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,600
am I going to work okay and we're going

340
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,320
to think about the economics of that

341
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,360
decision okay so we're trying to decide

342
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,959
how many hours

343
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,560
H an individual wants to work okay how

344
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,560
do they make that

345
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,680
decision well on the one hand the more

346
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,959
they work the more [ __ ] they can

347
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,560
buy okay the more hours you work you're

348
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,160
in a wage per hour and so you can buy

349
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,240
more stuff and we like stuff okay more

350
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,759
is more is better so on the one hand we

351
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,000
want to work more because we want more

352
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:39,360
stuff on the other hand and here's what

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,959
gets really hard at MIT normal people

354
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,680
don't like to

355
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,160
work okay we are not normal people here

356
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,320
okay most people actually think of work

357
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,320
as a bad thing I know amazing huh most

358
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,959
people would rather not

359
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,320
work so the tradeoff is work you'd

360
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,839
rather not

361
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:05,360
work but by not working you have less

362
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:07,440
stuff so the tradeoff is a bad which is

363
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,399
working against a

364
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,560
good which is

365
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,759
stuff the problem is we don't know how

366
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,920
to model that we don't model tring bads

367
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,000
and goods that's too hard so we're going

368
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,800
to use a modeling trick and the modeling

369
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,720
trick is we're going to define the

370
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,399
complimentary good to work which is

371
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,040
Leisure Leisure we'll just call 24

372
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,600
minus8 you have 24 hours a day the

373
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,120
amount of leisure you take is 24 minus

374
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,800
the hours your

375
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,399
work by modeling Leisure if we solve for

376
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,800
optimal Leisure then we simply use this

377
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,079
simple relationship to solve for optimal

378
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,240
hours but it's hard to think this way

379
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,560
because fundamentally I'm asking how

380
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,480
hard you work but that's not what I'm

381
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,319
going to model I'm gonna model how hard

382
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,519
you party okay I'm gon a model

383
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,160
Leisure okay and work is going to be

384
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,600
residual we're going to solve for I'm

385
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,839
going to make the mistake occasionally

386
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,399
slipping into saying it's a choice of

387
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,639
work it's not it's a choice of leisure

388
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,199
and if you don't think that way you get

389
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,920
the modeling wrong the modeling is

390
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,399
because we once we put in two good

391
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,160
framework we're back to Consumer Theory

392
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,680
we know what to do we not how to trade

393
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,839
off two goods we doing that our you know

394
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,480
all

395
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,720
semester so we have two goods now

396
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,199
Leisure and

397
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,880
stuff okay and that's the trade-off we

398
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,920
want to make okay and that's the general

399
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,600
modeling trick is instead of modeling a

400
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,600
a bad we model the compliment very good

401
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,120
yeah um you know that is uh yes that

402
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
that is a similar straight off if you

403
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,759
think about sleep as Leisure you know

404
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,959
Leisure includes sleep you got to sleep

405
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,720
in this 24 hours sorry guys you do have

406
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:57,920
to sleep in that 24 hours so that's a

407
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,560
similar thing okay so basically you have

408
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,880
this tradeoff

409
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,600
so basically we are going to

410
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,880
model this now what that means is we

411
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,480
need to model we don't had to model the

412
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,319
demand for goods we've been doing that

413
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,480
for weeks but how do we model the demand

414
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,120
for

415
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,760
leisure so we're going to model the

416
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,760
supply of

417
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,120
labor by inverting it and modeling

418
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,400
demand for

419
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,919
leisure and we know and so we're going

420
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,240
to basically take our standard model and

421
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,960
instead of trading off between pizzas

422
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,080
and cookies you're going to trade off

423
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,200
between Leisure and stuff and that is

424
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,919
figure

425
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
151 figure 151 and I've put all the

426
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,400
stuff in one graph instead of walking

427
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,559
you through it okay on the Y AIS is

428
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,120
consumption now when I think of

429
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,360
consumption think of consumption as all

430
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,840
the stuff you're going to

431
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,960
consume your pizza and your

432
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,799
cookies okay on the xaxis is leisure

433
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,080
you have a 24-hour

434
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,559
maximum so you can take between zero and

435
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,720
24 hours of leisure so as you move to

436
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,799
the right on the xaxis you're modeling

437
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,520
Leisure of course that means that hours

438
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,039
you move to the left on the x-axis once

439
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,200
again we're not modeling hours modeling

440
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:20,480
Leisure Hours we just get at the

441
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,640
end okay so you then have a budget

442
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,840
constraint which is you can take 24

443
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,600
hours of leisure and consume nothing

444
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,039
that's the x intercept

445
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,799
or take no leisure and consume 24 times

446
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,520
your wage that's the Y

447
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,799
intercept now let me just make one point

448
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,960
the y axis is vague what is consumption

449
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,400
and here's I'm going to come back to

450
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,400
something I mentioned earlier in the

451
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,679
class we have complicated

452
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,720
multi-dimensional decisions we do them

453
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,880
sequentially earlier I gave you income

454
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,000
remember I said consumer theory is

455
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
easier than producer Theory because

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,559
income is just given to you now I'm

457
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,919
deriving where that income com comes

458
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,280
from so the idea is You' use a model

459
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,440
like this to solve for your income and

460
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,840
then given your income you go back to

461
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,240
your cookies versus Pizza model so right

462
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,919
now you're solving for how much Z work

463
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,520
versus how much stuff I have later I'll

464
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,559
decide how to spend my money on that

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,600
stuff right now I'm deciding how much Z

466
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,520
work versus how much stuff I'm gonna

467
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,000
have in total okay so think of the

468
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,520
sequential decision we're now going back

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,280
and taking that y that I gave to you and

470
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,320
making a decision

471
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,240
variable

472
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,559
okay so that is the budget constraint

473
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,679
what is the slope of the budget

474
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:38,039
constraint the slope is minus

475
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:42,039
W the slope is minus

476
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,360
W okay um what does oh I'm sorry we're

477
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,280
going to make one other assumption to

478
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,360
make life easy we're going to assume the

479
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,120
price of consumption Goods is one that

480
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,440
is there's some aggre consumption good

481
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,320
you're buying with a price of one this

482
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,559
is a trick we call making a numer rare

483
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,159
good it makes life easy otherwise we'd

484
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,799
have to track the price of consumption

485
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,000
throughout remember we did pizza versus

486
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,760
cookies you need to track the price of

487
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,799
pizza versus the price of cookies in not

488
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,480
ratio by setting PC to one we no longer

489
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,200
of a ratio to track just a level so the

490
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,120
slope of the budget constraint is then

491
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,280
instead of being minus W over PC it's

492
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,200
just minus W technically it's minus W

493
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:23,200
over PC right is the slope of the budget

494
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,200
constraint but we're setting PC to

495
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,840
one okay so slope of the bud constraint

496
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:33,360
is minus W what

497
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,840
what does that mean that means that the

498
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,200
price of

499
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,200
leisure is the

500
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,159
wage in what sense is the price of

501
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,840
leisure the wage why is the wage the

502
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,840
price of

503
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,840
leisure

504
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,360
yeah not which we call opportunity cost

505
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,559
because the oper this is why economics

506
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,080
is annoying because now every time you

507
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,880
sit down and watch TV I want you to

508
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,200
realize you are paying something to

509
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,200
watch that TV you're paying the

510
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,919
opportunity cost of not

511
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,240
working okay Leisure has a price the

512
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,960
price is the wage what you could have

513
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,960
been making by working during that hour

514
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,000
so the price of leisure Leisure is a

515
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,039
good just like cookies are a good it's a

516
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,880
good with a benefit and then it makes

517
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,840
you happy and a cost in which you have

518
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
to pay for it here you don't pay

519
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,120
explicitly I don't charge you to watch

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,080
you pay an opportunity cost which is

521
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,279
you're not working you could have been

522
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:40,760
working instead okay questions about

523
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:43,360
that so that's your budget

524
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,000
constraint now against this you say you

525
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,000
have a well- defined utility function

526
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,840
we're toity function is U equals F of

527
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,320
consumption and Leisure that is there's

528
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,240
two things you care about in life how

529
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,679
much stuff you have and how much Leisure

530
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,400
you have that's the two positive things

531
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,360
you care about you want Leisure remember

532
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
this is not

533
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,720
MIT okay you want

534
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,919
Leisure okay those are the two things

535
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,120
you care about in life and that's the

536
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,200
trade-off you make and we know how to

537
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,400
then maximize this utility

538
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,279
function okay so for example suppose we

539
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,039
write this in our Fame in our favorite

540
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,080
form square root of C * L let's say

541
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,720
that's utility

542
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,240
function what's your budget

543
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,520
constraint well your budget constraint

544
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,320
is that your

545
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
consumption the total amount you spend

546
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,240
in consumption this is really

547
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,559
consumption times price of consumption

548
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,880
but we set that to

549
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,960
one okay your consumption times the

550
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,640
price of consumption that's what you

551
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,640
want to spend

552
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,799
equals 24 minus L times your

553
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,600
wage this is what you're

554
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:51,120
spending this is what you're making

555
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,480
remember we're still assuming no savings

556
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,600
we said that early on in this world

557
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,960
we're assuming people don't save so

558
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,640
every period you're going to spend what

559
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,240
you make

560
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,960
this is what you make 24 lusus L * W

561
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,360
this is what you

562
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,120
spend okay so that's your budget

563
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,480
constraint okay we know how to optimize

564
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,159
we know how to solve this consumer

565
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,880
optimization

566
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,880
problem which is we know

567
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,039
that to optimize you want to set the

568
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,159
margin

569
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,559
utility the ratio of margin utilities

570
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,120
equal to the ratio of prices or the

571
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,600
slope of the budget constraint so you

572
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,679
want to set minus the margin utility of

573
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,760
leisure over the margin utility of

574
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,279
consumption equal to minus the wage once

575
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,480
again over the price of consumption but

576
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,960
price of consumption would normalize to

577
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,960
one okay so you want to set the margin

578
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,840
ility of leisure of the marginality of

579
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,120
consumption equal to the

580
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,559
wage that's the optimization condition

581
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,320
that's just back to pizza and cookies

582
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,080
guys same thing said of pizza and

583
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,960
cookies it's Leisure and

584
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,520
consumption okay given the square root

585
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,440
function we know how to solve this which

586
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,520
is we know that this is that the this

587
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,279
MTI margin utility is going to be minus

588
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,919
C over l so we set minus C over L the

589
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,240
minus W to solve this just plug in do

590
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,840
marginal Roots we've done it a million

591
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,080
times for the square root function okay

592
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,799
so that's your optimization condition is

593
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,320
that minus C overl equals minus

594
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,640
W okay we can then plug that into the

595
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,880
budget constraint plug this into the

596
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,480
budget we have two equations and two

597
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,279
unknowns

598
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,640
this is the budget constraint this the

599
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,960
optimization condition so it's two

600
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:40,000
equations and two unknowns we solve it

601
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:45,600
and we get that um if we for example uh

602
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:49,039
so we solve that and we get that um

603
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,039
leisure in this

604
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:57,200
case right we get that Leisure equals

605
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,120
12 the amount of leisure does not depend

606
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
on the wage in this for this particular

607
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,200
functional form of utility it's

608
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
generally not true Leisure will

609
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,600
generally depend on the wage but for

610
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,720
this particular model it doesn't so we

611
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,480
get Leisure equals 12 we take 12 hours

612
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,480
of leisure and

613
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,880
consumption did I do something wrong one

614
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,880
second

615
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,559
sorry equal 12 w yeah that's right um uh

616
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,799
Leisure equals 12 so for this particular

617
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,600
case you always choose the same amount

618
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,320
of leisure and consumption therefore is

619
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,480
12 *

620
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,600
W you work so you take 12 hours of

621
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
leisure you work 12 hours and you get 12

622
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,919
times W in

623
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,240
consumption that's mathematical we can

624
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,799
see it graphically in figure

625
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,240
151 you have an indifference curve which

626
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,360
come which is the ratio of margin

627
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,320
utilities where that is tangent to the

628
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,520
budget

629
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,480
constraint is at 12 hours of leisure and

630
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,080
12 w consumption that is your optimal

631
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,240
Choice you're done how hard do you work

632
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,399
well we have this equation you work 12

633
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,320
hours but we didn't get to that till the

634
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:12,840
very end we only cared about Leisure

635
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,200
through the whole model okay question

636
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,200
about that

637
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:23,240
optimization now what

638
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:27,159
happens if the wage rate

639
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:30,480
changes well we can't understand that

640
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:33,399
without coming back and thinking about

641
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,120
income and substitution

642
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:37,480
effects okay to understand the effect of

643
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,919
a wage rate

644
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,960
change we need to come back to income

645
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,320
and substitution effect so to do this

646
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,480
this is sort of an uninteresting case

647
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,640
because this doesn't Leisure depend on

648
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,320
wage I'm going to come I'm going to now

649
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,159
move to a different case I'm not going

650
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,919
to do the math or so graphically where

651
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:58,640
Leisure does depend on wage so now we're

652
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,080
going to come back to how do consumers

653
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,960
react when a price changes well we know

654
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,399
consumers react when a price changes

655
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,480
there's substitution income effects so

656
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:09,120
let's go to figure 152 we have the

657
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,760
original budget constraint 24 times W1

658
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,679
and let's say the wage now Rises to

659
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,919
W2 the wage Rises to

660
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:21,159
W2 okay the budget straint pivots

661
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,880
outward you have the same consumption

662
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,279
which is zero if you don't work but with

663
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,000
every hour of work you get more

664
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,440
consumption the slope is steeper

665
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,480
what effect does that have on how hard

666
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,600
you work don't look at the graph for a

667
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,919
second if I said to you hey the wage

668
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,559
went up you're going to work harder or

669
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,960
less hard most people would

670
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,200
say what would somebody said tell me

671
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
what you think

672
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,200
yeah

673
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,600
why fascinating okay most people say the

674
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,159
opposite actually which is gee I can

675
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,039
make more so I work harder there's a

676
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,679
more return to work

677
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,480
but you've also given a sensible answer

678
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,320
too which is let's imagine I needed a th

679
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,720
bucks to buy a computer if my wage just

680
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,360
went up from 20 to $40 an hour I need to

681
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,600
work Less hours to buy that

682
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,360
computer what you've just Illustrated is

683
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,799
that when we comes to labor Supply GIF

684
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,799
and goods are not

685
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:25,120
rare okay when we didn't come in

686
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,760
substitution effects remember the

687
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,760
substitution effect always went the

688
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,159
opposite opposite direction of the price

689
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,640
increase okay the income effect

690
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,240
depending on whether the good was normal

691
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,919
or

692
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:44,880
inferior now that's not going to be

693
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,760
true the substitution effect now for

694
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,679
leisure will always go the direction of

695
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,480
the price

696
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:56,039
increase why because a price increase

697
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
I'm sorry the the substitution was still

698
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,279
go the opposite direction of the price

699
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,200
increase I'm sorry the substitution

700
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,320
still goes the opposite direction of the

701
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,360
price increase so let's do the

702
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,640
substitution effect the price of

703
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,720
leisure's gone up okay so let's look at

704
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,320
this graphically the price of leisure's

705
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,320
gone up why because you you give up more

706
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,640
by having

707
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,120
Leisure we can do the substitution

708
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,840
Factor Remember by drawing the imaginary

709
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,559
budget constraint BC

710
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,720
Prime that is tangent to the original

711
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,000
indifference

712
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,320
curve but at the new price ratio and

713
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,320
what you see is the substitution effect

714
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,519
is negative like it always is when a

715
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,360
price goes up you want less of

716
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,440
something subst effect is always

717
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,960
negative when a price go up you want

718
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,640
less of something in this case the price

719
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,200
of leisure went up you want less of it

720
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,279
and that's the standard intuition many

721
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,960
people have most people if you say if

722
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,279
the if you can earn more at work I work

723
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,640
Le less hard or more hard people say I

724
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,480
work more hard because like I get more

725
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,519
return from my

726
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,159
work but the income

727
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,640
effect now goes the other way even if

728
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,080
Leisure is normal

729
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,960
before to get the income effect to go

730
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,559
the other way we need pizza to be

731
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,880
inferior that's not true anymore why

732
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,279
because think of what the income effect

733
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,519
does here the income effect is as the

734
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:17,120
wage goes up I'm

735
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,519
richer when I'm richer I want more of

736
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,679
all normal

737
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,720
Goods Leisure is a normal good so I want

738
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,640
more of

739
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,640
it so if Leisure is a normal good as is

740
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,559
for everyone except MIT students

741
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,320
that as your income goes up you want

742
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,279
more of it so here the income effect

743
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,679
offsets substitution effect without

744
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,240
having a weird case you don't need to be

745
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,080
Ramen you don't need inferior good for a

746
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
normal good the income effect offsets

747
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,720
substitution effect and that's why we

748
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,440
learn the [ __ ] income substitution

749
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,679
effects they're pain in the ass so like

750
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,720
it didn't matter for Consumer Theory

751
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,360
right because I said they're no giving

752
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,720
Goods that's why we learn them because

753
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,279
they do matter when it comes to factor

754
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,000
supply income Sol effects do matter so

755
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,559
in fact it's natural that think of ass

756
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,760
effects that offset each other let's

757
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:06,559
once again review what these effects are

758
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,360
the substitution effect is G every hour

759
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,200
of work makes it more costly to sit at

760
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,960
home so I'm going to work

761
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:18,960
more the income effect is wow I'm richer

762
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,559
now therefore I want more of all normal

763
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,799
Goods Leisure is a normal good so I want

764
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,440
more Leisure so I'm going to work

765
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,440
less and the best intuition I find that

766
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,039
effect very hard to understand

767
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,600
I think the best intuition is what we

768
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,760
call the target income model which is

769
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,519
what I use the example here imagine you

770
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,960
just simply want to work hard enough to

771
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,799
buy X you have a Target

772
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,720
income in that case by definition a

773
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,880
higher wage caus you to work less hard

774
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,919
that was the intuition that was given

775
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,360
here that was a Target in that was a

776
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,720
Target income intuition that's the

777
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,120
income effect dominating the

778
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,919
substitution

779
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,600
effect so whether a higher wage leads

780
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,559
you to work harder or less hard

781
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,440
or in terms of the model leads you to

782
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,240
take less Leisure or more Leisure will

783
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,279
depend on the relative size of the

784
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,120
income and substitution effects so in

785
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,960
figure

786
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,000
152 we've got a substitution effect

787
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,279
that's larger than income

788
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,480
effect therefore Leisure overall goes

789
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,880
down the higher wage caus you to take

790
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,519
less Leisure and therefore to work

791
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,440
harder but in figure

792
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,120
153 we have the opposite

793
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,760
we have an income effect that dominates

794
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,399
substitution

795
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:40,120
effect therefore a higher

796
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:42,760
wage causes you to take more Leisure not

797
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,559
less this is think about this this is a

798
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,000
gif and good this saying a higher price

799
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:49,519
caus you want more of something right a

800
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,960
higher price of leisures caus you want

801
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,279
more of it but it's not a weird case it

802
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,840
seems sensible in fact that was the

803
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,399
intuition that was given to me

804
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,840
first so here giv goods are not rare and

805
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:02,639
mythical they're real because the income

806
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,919
effect you don't need an inferior good

807
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:06,720
it's just the Classic case the income

808
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,399
effect offsets a substitution effect

809
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,440
okay let me pause there that is a hard

810
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:15,120
intuition and let me see if people have

811
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,120
questions about

812
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:25,960
that okay so here's the key

813
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:29,799
point if substitution effects

814
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,399
dominate then a higher wage leads to

815
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:36,440
more leads to less

816
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:40,279
Leisure so therefore if we translate

817
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,760
that to a Leisure demand curve that

818
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:46,200
translates to a downward

819
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,600
sloping Leisure demand curve demand

820
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,639
curve slopes down right so if you've got

821
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,000
I put put in the handout but if you've

822
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:54,600
got a Leisure demand curve whereas

823
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,080
here's the amount of leisure and here's

824
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,720
the price of leisure which is the wage

825
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,720
then it slops down

826
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,000
okay basically the the higher the wage

827
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,280
the less Leisure you

828
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,159
want but we don't care about leisure in

829
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,159
the end we care about Labor this

830
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,960
translates when we do labor to wage to a

831
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,399
rising supply

832
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,320
curve that as the wage goes up you get

833
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,760
more

834
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,599
labor so once again we model this but we

835
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,159
we care about this we're talking about

836
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,480
Labor Supply remember at the end of the

837
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,320
day that's what this part of the lecture

838
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,679
is

839
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,079
called so what it's saying is if

840
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,839
substitution effects dominate we get the

841
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,800
typical upward sloping supply curve we

842
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,000
know and love indeed I already when I T

843
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,879
about when we talked about Labor marks

844
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,399
before that's what I

845
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,240
assumed but in fact that doesn't have to

846
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,599
happen if income effects

847
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,280
dominate then in that case if income

848
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,400
effects dominate you're going to get a

849
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,119
downward sloping demand

850
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,839
if income effects dominate you get a

851
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:06,520
main curve that looks like

852
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:07,880
that and a supply curve that's backwards

853
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,240
you're going to get a downward sloping

854
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,400
supply curve which is pretty

855
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,400
screwy but that's the

856
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:20,320
implication if income effects dominate

857
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,440
then higher wages lead to less

858
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,800
work which is pretty crazy okay even

859
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,800
though it was the initial

860
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,960
intuition we were just used to Upward

861
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,320
sloping Supply curves this class this

862
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,680
would end up with a downward sloping

863
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,680
supply

864
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:40,960
curve okay questions about

865
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,920
that okay so this is very this is really

866
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,720
really

867
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,920
important because

868
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,640
fundamentally one of the key policy

869
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,480
issues in America is about how much

870
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,240
workers get paid for example should we

871
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,599
tax work should there be a minimum wage

872
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,480
what about Unions that's all about how

873
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,079
much workers get paid well it's sort of

874
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,400
hard to evaluate that issue if we don't

875
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,560
know what effect that's going to have if

876
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,920
paying workers more is going to cause

877
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,240
them to work more hard or less hard

878
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,480
that's pretty fundamental to understand

879
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,400
the implications of raising the

880
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,040
wage so what do we actually know well

881
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,119
the evidence is actually fascinating

882
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,880
what do we know about Labor Supply it's

883
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,720
fascinating what I'm going to do to

884
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,520
understand this is I'm gonna talk about

885
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,880
two

886
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,440
groups prime age that is like 25 to 64

887
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,640
year old married men and married

888
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,800
women obviously other groups inide let's

889
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,240
just focus on those for a second I want

890
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,839
you to start by casting your mind back

891
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,480
to 50 years ago when I was a kid when I

892
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:46,240
was a kid almost every Prim AG man

893
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,359
worked and fewer than half Prime AG

894
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,440
women

895
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,280
worked okay it was a very different

896
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,720
labor market than it is

897
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,960
today okay so what I want you to think

898
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,200
about in that world I want you to think

899
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,760
about an to it the size of substitution

900
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,160
and income effects so let's talk about

901
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,160
married

902
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,359
men and married

903
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,680
women and let's talk about their

904
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,720
substitution

905
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,880
effect and their income effect and I

906
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,280
just want you to think about relative

907
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,480
sizes so let's start with the

908
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,240
substitution effect who do we think

909
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,720
would have a bigger sub in the world of

910
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,319
50 years ago the typical sort of sexist

911
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,319
world where men were were the bread

912
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,720
winners women still work but much less

913
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:41,640
than men who do we think had the bigger

914
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,079
substitution

915
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,599
effect and why think about what drives

916
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:50,400
the substitution

917
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,400
effect and they help give the

918
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,400
answer yeah

919
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,400
Al well not better is normative there's

920
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,040
an alternative men there's no

921
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,200
alternative if you were a man good Lord

922
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,760
you didn't spend time with your children

923
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,920
no man did that and you couldn't go

924
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,640
golfing because your friends were all

925
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,040
working basically men 50 years ago like

926
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,960
golfed and worked it's kind of what they

927
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,880
did okay so basically there's no

928
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,040
substitution you got to work what else

929
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,359
are you going to do women had

930
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,359
Alternatives they were the primary child

931
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,280
rearing or even if they weren't many

932
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:30,000
women without kids just simply work that

933
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,160
was an alternative it wasn't viewed

934
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,640
negatively

935
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,200
socially maybe not 60 years ago uh but

936
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,079
it was the alternative so the

937
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,240
substitution effect could be quite big

938
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,960
for women because they have Alternatives

939
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,359
so they can decide gee when the wage

940
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,680
goes

941
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,079
up that makes Leisure more expensive

942
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,599
might want to work more whereas the men

943
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,720
they were already working there wasn't a

944
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:59,520
lot of decision to be made yeah oh women

945
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:05,240
sorry I that's backwards

946
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:08,800
small small big okay

947
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,240
okay now here's an even harder one what

948
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,040
about the income effect I'm not going to

949
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,720
ask this one because it's

950
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,079
hard the income effect is tricky because

951
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,520
the income

952
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:24,680
effect is not just how responsive your

953
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,960
work is to income but it also depends on

954
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,720
how much you're already working if

955
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,720
you're not

956
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,720
working if you are not

957
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,920
working then there's no income

958
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,400
effect because my income doesn't change

959
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,040
when the wage goes

960
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:46,280
up right so my income changes more the

961
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,800
more I'm working so the income effect is

962
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,560
really technically it's measured as

963
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,520
DL or

964
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:59,480
DH

965
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Dy times y0 times initial

966
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,640
income well if you're women many of them

967
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,440
didn't work so they had a small income

968
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,200
effect men they worked so income effect

969
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,599
was bigger now maybe not big but bigger

970
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,720
so you might say here the income effect

971
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,119
is

972
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,440
bigger because women didn't have an inum

973
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:22,359
effect because they weren't

974
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,960
working so you got a situation where

975
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:29,319
men

976
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,319
have I'm uh I did this wrong again [ __ ]

977
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:37,960
bigger okay so we have a situation where

978
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:41,359
men have a small substitution effect and

979
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,880
plausibly a bigger income effect women

980
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,560
have a big substitution effect and not

981
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,000
much of an income effect based on that

982
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,800
what should be the relative shapes of

983
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,240
their labor Supply

984
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,680
curves whose labor supply curve should

985
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,880
for sure slope up and whose would be

986
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,880
more uncertain

987
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,480
yeah women's Curve would slope up

988
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,960
because the substitution effect would

989
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,880
dominate men's we don't know sub small

990
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,000
the income effect might be big it's Sly

991
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,119
bigger than for women we don't know so

992
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,240
in fact we'd expect intuitively that

993
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,720
women would have an strong upward

994
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,200
sloping supply

995
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:29,240
curve and then we wouldn't

996
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,240
know probably backwards yeah

997
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,440
effect why isn't the income effects for

998
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,079
men kind of small because they're going

999
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,040
to work it might be small that's why I

1000
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,880
saying it's uncertain it's bigger but

1001
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,079
still probably

1002
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,880
small

1003
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,920
okay so so we have for women a clear big

1004
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,599
you know we'll call this zero okay with

1005
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,680
a clear big substit effect zero here we

1006
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:53,359
know which way it goes men it's not

1007
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,400
clear well what does the evidence say

1008
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,000
the evidence exactly lined up with their

1009
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,720
intuition which is women's labor Supply

1010
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,800
curves were very strongly upward sloping

1011
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,160
women had Fairly elastic labor Supply

1012
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,280
the elasticity of Labor supply for

1013
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,079
married women was about

1014
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,960
0.5 that is for every 10% increase in

1015
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,160
wages women were 5% harder for men it

1016
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,800
was approximately zero maybe a little

1017
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:24,160
bit negative but approx roughly speaking

1018
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,280
zero so basically labor supply curve

1019
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,119
shapes comported with the intuition we

1020
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,119
get from Theory

1021
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,119
now what do we think has happened to the

1022
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,680
shape of women's labor supply curve over

1023
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,680
time and

1024
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,880
why um uh let let's Okay you sort of

1025
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,680
skip to men let's focus just on women

1026
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,680
what's changed for

1027
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,319
women right but does that made their

1028
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,800
substitution options better or Worse do

1029
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,319
do women do do are women Freer in some

1030
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,319
sense or less free to decide whether to

1031
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,839
work I wouldn't say so I mean certainly

1032
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,760
female labor participation has gone up

1033
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,280
from less than 50 to

1034
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,800
80% I would say if you ask many women at

1035
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,839
work they wouldn't say they do so

1036
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,440
because it's free they'd say do so

1037
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,760
because they need to the family needs

1038
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,240
the money or it's just women's work has

1039
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,480
become in some like men's work it's sort

1040
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,720
of socially unacceptable just hanging

1041
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,040
out at home if you're a woman

1042
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,119
like it was social unacceptable for a

1043
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,400
man so in substance their substance

1044
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,960
effects gone down because it's become

1045
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,160
more like like men they basically now

1046
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,440
working sort of

1047
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,119
default the women in this class all

1048
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,280
expect to go to work when they graduate

1049
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,720
that was not true 60 years ago maybe

1050
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,079
here at MIT but not most

1051
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,599
places okay so there's sort of not much

1052
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,480
of a substitution effect because you're

1053
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,400
going to

1054
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,119
work likewise your income effect has

1055
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,440
gone up because now you have income so

1056
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,000
women's labor supply curve has gotten

1057
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,559
steeper they've start their labor Supply

1058
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,760
looks more like men the amount they work

1059
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,440
looks more like men so their lb fly

1060
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,839
curve looks more like

1061
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,640
men now let me come back to that answer

1062
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,480
because part of the reason why is that

1063
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,359
you're wrong about one

1064
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,000
thing you might think well gee then

1065
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:21,079
men's labor fly curves must be getting

1066
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,520
flatter but they're not because men

1067
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:27,599
still don't take care of the

1068
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,160
kids okay so basically women work hard

1069
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,800
and men work hard the difference is the

1070
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,720
kids are now in child

1071
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,200
care okay so your intuition which is G

1072
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,800
women men will trade off men will become

1073
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,559
more flexible that's wrong women became

1074
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,319
more inflexible and Men stayed

1075
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:46,400
inflexible okay and the difference is

1076
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,319
child growth in child care okay so

1077
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,640
basically it's a fascinating your

1078
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,000
intuition what happened to women and

1079
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,640
once you once they gave you the manactor

1080
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,359
you sort of get the intuition of Why

1081
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,640
women's labor Supply became more

1082
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,559
inelastic became more vertical but but

1083
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,800
it partly it's because men's didn't

1084
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,079
adjust either and when now in World

1085
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,720
basically in almost all couples both

1086
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,040
Partners

1087
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:14,040
work okay questions about

1088
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,240
that okay I want to end with an

1089
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,440
interesting

1090
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,559
application from one of my really

1091
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,520
favorite interesting empirical studies

1092
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,880
in

1093
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,359
economics which is thinking about free

1094
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,359
trade we haven't talked about trade yet

1095
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,800
we'll come to that in a few lectures but

1096
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,800
I'll use some basic intuition and the

1097
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:36,440
impacts on child

1098
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,920
labor now um what I want to do is I want

1099
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,240
to set up the problem but I don't want

1100
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,000
to rush so we'll solve it next time so

1101
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,440
Andrew let's have these last couple

1102
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,280
diagrams be the first couple diagrams in

1103
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,480
the next lectures hand out so I want to

1104
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,319
set up the problem but I want to rush to

1105
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,000
solve it because it's a really important

1106
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,880
intuition okay a common criticism of

1107
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,280
free

1108
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:02,440
trade is that will induce child labor

1109
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,760
they will say people will say gee if

1110
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,040
there's more free trade that means

1111
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,200
country want to sell more stuff that

1112
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,680
means kids are going to have to go to

1113
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,480
work and that's a major reason to not

1114
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,920
allow free

1115
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:18,480
trade so we can actually Analyze That

1116
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:21,720
and show that intuition intuition may be

1117
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,880
wrong to see that let's talk about the

1118
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,599
country of

1119
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:30,000
Vietnam I was just in Vietnam this

1120
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,760
spring before before the early

1121
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,400
1990s

1122
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,559
Vietnam could not export its main crop

1123
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,839
which is

1124
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,160
rice because there was all these because

1125
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:43,599
war was going on the US was still mad at

1126
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:46,040
Vietnam there was a lot of

1127
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,559
barriers so Vietnam could not export its

1128
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,240
main crop which is rice so let's look at

1129
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:53,440
figure

1130
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,040
154 to show what effect that has and

1131
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,400
also Vietnam also wouldn't let Farmers

1132
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,040
export R it wasn't just other countries

1133
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,400
wouldn't want it Vietnam wouldn't let it

1134
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,920
be exported Vietnam said no we need the

1135
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,119
rice here for our people we won't export

1136
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,920
it so the rice Market in Vietnam is

1137
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:10,119
described in figure 154 on the XX you

1138
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,040
have quantity of rice on the YX you have

1139
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,160
the price you have a supply of rice

1140
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,040
that'll be unchanged for this example s

1141
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,680
subv that's a domestic supply of rice in

1142
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,079
Vietnam and you had a domestic demand

1143
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:26,079
for Rice that's D

1144
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,440
subv and the government said we have to

1145
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,599
we cannot export R so what that meant

1146
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,280
was the rice Market will be forced at

1147
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,240
equilibrium at that quota line at a

1148
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,119
quantity QV and a price PV that would be

1149
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,280
the government enforced

1150
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,319
equilibrium okay what happened after

1151
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,960
1989 is they left Vietnam export RS and

1152
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,960
in particular after 1994 when the US

1153
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,599
normalized relations with

1154
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,240
Vietnam um they could export RS to the

1155
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:56,480
US what happened was that led to a

1156
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,599
massive increase in demand for race

1157
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,240
because the the rest of the world now

1158
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:04,800
wanted cheap Vietnamese rice that

1159
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:07,599
shifted out the demand curve from DV to

1160
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,079
DW now it's the world demand for

1161
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,480
Rice okay shift after dvdw which meant

1162
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,559
that Vietnam now produced more rice at a

1163
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,920
higher

1164
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:21,760
price and the criticism is well GE to

1165
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,319
produce more rice you need more labor

1166
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,440
and a lot of that labor comes from kids

1167
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,119
and we see that criticism in a diet

1168
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,079
in figure 155 I think I will get through

1169
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,400
this now just bear with me might go one

1170
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:38,319
minute late figure 155 is diag for child

1171
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,200
labor in Vietnam on the x-axis is the

1172
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:44,160
amount of child labor on the y- axis is

1173
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,839
the wage and pre-trade we're in

1174
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,880
equilibrium with L1 kids working W1

1175
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,319
working at a wage of

1176
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,720
W1 now we have free trade what free

1177
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:57,839
trade does is it increases the demand

1178
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,160
for labor the price has gone up so if

1179
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:04,000
you flip back to figure 154 you need

1180
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,880
more rice Q subw is higher than QV how

1181
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,480
you produce more rice you have more

1182
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,599
workers some of those workers are kids

1183
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,880
so that shifts out the demand for child

1184
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:16,359
labor from D1 to

1185
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,280
D2 and therefore increases the amount of

1186
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:21,960
child labor from L1 to

1187
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,680
L2 and that is the story for why free

1188
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,720
trade increases child

1189
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,440
labor what do it

1190
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,680
Miss what it misses is the price of rice

1191
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,319
also went up and when the price of rice

1192
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,920
went up what did that do it made the

1193
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:37,040
Vietnamese richer as an American I was

1194
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,319
quite frankly as someone who grew up

1195
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,920
during the Vietnam War I was a little

1196
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,880
sort of afraid to go to Vietnam what

1197
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,000
would they think of Americans they love

1198
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,000
Americans and their hero is Bill Clinton

1199
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,520
why because Bill Clinton normalized

1200
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
trade with Vietnam and let them sell the

1201
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:54,400
rice in America and their wealth went up

1202
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,920
enormously what do you do when you're

1203
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:02,040
richer you buy nor of normal Goods

1204
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,480
what's a normal good your kid not

1205
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,280
working people want people Vietnam care

1206
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,880
about their kids they want the kids in

1207
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,640
school not working so while it's true

1208
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,680
the demand for child labor went up the

1209
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,240
supply of child labor decreased because

1210
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,400
people didn't have didn't want their

1211
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,599
kids to work so there's an opposite

1212
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,400
inward shift of the supply

1213
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,640
curve and indeed if that shift was big

1214
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,880
enough you see shift from S1 S2 if it

1215
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,160
was big enough all the way to S3 child

1216
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,559
labor Could Fall In other words even

1217
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,280
though there was more demand for child

1218
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,960
labor the Vietnamese were so richer so

1219
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,799
much richer they said we don't want our

1220
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,880
kids to work so there's an increase in

1221
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:45,119
an reduction in child labor Supply that

1222
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,799
offset the increase in demand and you

1223
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,640
could actually see child labor falling

1224
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,599
there was a careful empirical study done

1225
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:55,319
of trade liberalization Vietnam and it

1226
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:58,359
found exactly that that Freer trade led

1227
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:59,520
to less child child labor not more a

1228
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:01,960
fascinating example how you can use

1229
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,040
basic economics to overcome a sort of

1230
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,920
what you might think is an easy

1231
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,960
intuition all right I'm going to stop

1232
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,960
there sorry to go long we'll come back

1233
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,880
and talk about the minimum wage and

1234
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,880
capital Supply next time
