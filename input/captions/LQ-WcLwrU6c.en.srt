1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Okay, congrats on turning in paper

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
number two. For those of you who've

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,760
turned in paper number two, and for

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,840
those who are wrapping things up, uh,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,560
good luck. Um, your next assignment is

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,720
very, very open-ended. paper three, you

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,760
just get to pick what you want to do.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,520
Um, if there's kind of the only

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,120
restriction on it is like you can't turn

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,719
in like this assignment in another

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
class, like you can't like the same

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,559
paper in two classes, but other than

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,559
that, there are very very few guidelines

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,120
on what you could do. I am particularly

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,920
enthusiastic about anyone who picks an

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,879
assignment that is connected to things

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
they're already working on. Um, so like

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
you know Kent should totally do

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,920
something about Mccclea. Like he what I

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
don't I don't know what that is but he

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
like probably no one has ever asked him

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
like you know write eight or 10 pages

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,479
about what it is you're trying to do

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,320
there or do some more research that

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,159
helps inform what you're doing or design

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,479
your next steps or whatever it is. But

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,360
that would be a great project for Kent.

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,600
Um and even if Kent is like even if it's

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,119
your is to like build Mccclea or

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
whatever it's totally fine to have

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,240
something that's very adjacent to that.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,560
Um, I've had doctoral students who part

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,400
of their who like did part of the

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,759
literature review that they have to do

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,119
like for writing a chapter of their

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,600
dissertation or something that was

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,040
great. Um, so if there so any of I mean

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
you can also pick something that is

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
completely unrelated to what you're

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,759
working on just a thing that you're

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,400
interested in exploring further. Um,

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
anything is is fine. Um, but part of the

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,040
assignment is figuring out what it is

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,520
that you want to do. Okay. Um what we

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:56,040
want to try to do then today is talk

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,719
about um two of these as yet intractable

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,320
dilemmas that you've read about. So in

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
the first half of the book and in the

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,680
course we talked about these three

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,000
genres of learning and scale tried to

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,119
emphasize to you that these genres have

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
predictable characteristics. they have

53
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,760
semi-predictable impacts in school

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,160
settings. Um that uh and that their

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,720
impacts are almost never transformative.

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,959
They have the potential to be useful. Um

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,280
and to some extent there's a kind of

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
like ongoing disappointment. Um, you

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
know, think of all of the amazing things

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,640
that we've developed from radio, film

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
strips, television,

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,720
um, videos, personal computers, the

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,480
internet, instructional tutors, online

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,480
communities, all these different things.

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,160
And like none of them have really like

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,319
blown the walls off school. Like school

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
is still kind of school. Um, and in a

68
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,440
lot of cases like doesn't educate people

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
as well as we want to. So what like what

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,879
are some of the reasons why these

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
technologies don't have the

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,400
transformative impacts that we keep

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,360
hoping that they will? Um and that that

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,120
the four as yet intractable dilemmas the

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
the goal of this part of the book is to

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,760
say we know a bunch about why they don't

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,440
do all the things we want them to do.

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,000
Like we know some of the um challenges

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,200
that occur across these different

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,360
genres. Um, so you know, a thing like

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,120
Scratch, a MOO, an instructional tutor,

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
Khan Academy, there's a whole they they

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
might be really different in some

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
dimensions, but a lot of times they

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,760
still stumble across these same

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
problems. Um, some of this is me writing

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,840
like making an argument to the field.

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,120
Hey, if we if we want to do better in

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
the future, we're going to have to

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,400
figure out how we deal with these four

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,239
things. We're going to have to

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
understand these problems and how they

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
operate, and then we're going to have to

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
do better with them. Um, so today we'll

95
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
talk about the curse of the familiar and

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
the edtech Matthew effect and then we'll

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
talk about the trap of routine

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,319
assessment and the toxic power of data

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,040
and experiments. Um, why don't I give

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
you a minute to chat amongst yourselves.

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
Um, this was from a couple weeks ago,

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
but turn to the person next to you. talk

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
to this person about like what you

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,799
remember of what the curse of the

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,720
familiar is, why it would be a problem,

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
what kinds of things get stuck in the

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,879
curse of the familiar, and what kinds of

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,040
strategies seem to exist that might help

109
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,519
us get past that. Um, turn to the person

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,919
next to you and just externalize what

111
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:24,199
you remember about all this. Ready, go.

112
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,199
All right, come on back.

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,880
who want what what are what are some

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
what are some what are some things you

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
discussed that seemed core to the

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
definition if you were to quickly

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,440
summarize the curse of the familiar what

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,320
are some key ideas

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
like the idea of taking an old idea and

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
kind of repackaging it so that it

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
appears to be something new but really

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
isn't like I think we talked about the

123
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
idea of Quizlet versus flashcards it's

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
basically the same technological premise

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,199
but you're just digitizing it and and

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,919
What's the virtue of doing that?

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,360
I guess people will think it's new and

128
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
maybe won't be excited by that, but

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
there's no real change. Good. What do

130
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,000
people want to add to just that

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,759
particular idea?

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,080
I was going to say like it kind of stems

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,600
from this idea that um these new like

134
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,520
inventors um just have a lack of

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
knowledge of like what's come before

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
them. Um and like that's kind of like

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,560
where it can stem from. That can be a

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,080
problem. Yeah. Sabrina, what were you

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,919
going to say? And then Gloria, I was

140
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,000
going to say how they take like these

141
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,000
new technologies and instead of um

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
revolutionizing them, they just bend it

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,039
so that it fits the um how old

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,120
institutions still continues to be. I

145
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,880
like I like that we we take things and

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
we make them fit in existing

147
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
institutions. Yeah. I say that like

148
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
education and learning is very risk

149
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
averse. So people don't want their kids

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,919
or like to be the ones experimented on.

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
So when things are repackaged, it's

152
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,360
still like, oh, we know this works

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
because it's been done before, but it's

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
still new. Good. All right. So, I'm I'm

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
sensing a which might be appropriate

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,440
like a little bit of a negative vibe on

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,639
the on the people who are doing these

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,520
kinds of things. But if we wanted to

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,000
celebrate um folks who take technologies

160
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
that digitize existing practices, like

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,639
what's the virtue of that approach?

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,560
What's good about it?

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,039
I can carry like a million flash cards

164
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,720
in my pocket. Yeah. Yeah. Good. And

165
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,120
everyone knows what to do with them.

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
Like Quizlet has Quizlet might be the

167
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,680
most widely adopted piece of education

168
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,080
technology software used in American

169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,919
secondary schools. That's awesome. Um

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,120
Zillian like if you want the thing that

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,560
people will use you there's some good

172
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
evidence that you have to give them

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
something they're familiar with. And

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,160
also like mentioned that you can have a

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
million different flash cards in your

176
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
pocket but you can also have a million

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,160
different flash cards from other people

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
like sharing ideas globally. Yeah. Yeah.

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,440
Yeah. So we can we can take this idea of

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,560
a flash card and we can like tweak a

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,319
little bit. We can do some of the things

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,759
that digital technologies are good at.

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
We can make it scaled. We can make it

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
shared. We make all this kind of stuff

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,560
though, you know, with always running

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
into the hard limitation of like how

187
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,960
much can you improve schooling by

188
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,720
improving flash cards like like flash

189
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,039
cards are like I mean the joke I tell

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,280
often is if like if you got all of the

191
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,360
world's experts together and we're like

192
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
what does education really need? Like

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
what do we really need to go to the next

194
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,319
level? No one would raise their hand and

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,759
be like, "There's a huge der of flash

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
cards." Like, "We need to dramatically

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,680
include improve flash card technology."

198
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,599
Like, there's plenty of index cards.

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
There's like there's plenty of pencils.

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,880
You know, flash cards are like it's not

201
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,000
an obvious thing to revolutionize. Um,

202
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,919
also you like like I mean, I think if

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
you talk to Andrew, he wouldn't be he

204
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,440
wouldn't tell you this was a thing to

205
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
revolutionize education. It's like this

206
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,800
was just like a useful thing for me to

207
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,400
study French that other people found

208
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,319
useful and that I could sell. Um and uh

209
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,759
you know but so so a hu you know the I

210
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
mean these kinds of technologies are

211
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,160
like the the sort of square boxes like

212
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
it fits in the school. That's a virtue

213
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
like we can like we can only benefit

214
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,520
from technologies that fit in our

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
institutions. Our institutions are

216
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,919
riskaverse and they're conservative and

217
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,720
they have a bunch of constraints. Um

218
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,599
yeah Mari I think one point also that

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,840
the chapter made is that It's just a

220
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,400
phase where people use it in way they're

221
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,879
familiar with and then after a while

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,840
they're able to use it in more like

223
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,360
revolutionary ways. So the benefit of

224
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
having something that they already know

225
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,759
how it works is that they can use it

226
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,919
long enough to get to that point where

227
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,840
they might feel comfortable using it in

228
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,440
a way that haven't been used before.

229
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,599
Great. That is that is one of the two

230
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,520
ideas that I've proposed with sort of

231
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,360
not great research evidence behind them

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,000
that might be a way of getting past the

233
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,919
curse of the familiar that you introduce

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,800
things in schools that have a kind of

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,200
familiar structure to them but open them

236
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,240
up in ways that go somewhere else. I

237
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
don't think there's a lot of evidence

238
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
that Quizlet has been able to do that.

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,320
Like Quizlet gives you flashcards.

240
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
Actually, I just took a screenshot of

241
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,040
their website right now. Um Quizlet is

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
more than flashards. Like if you have to

243
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,279
say that you're more than flash cards,

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,279
you're probably just flash cards like

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,320
you know your sort of sort of special

246
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,240
pleading there. Um all right, you all

247
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,600
have

248
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,839
described this part of the curse of the

249
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
familiar. What would be some key ideas

250
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
of the sort of flip side of the curse of

251
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,800
the familiar? Um what are the challenges

252
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,760
you run into if you make something

253
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,760
that's really new and novel?

254
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
I feel like just going back to what was

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,519
said earlier, like people don't want

256
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,839
their kids to be experimented on. Like

257
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,680
when something's new, it's not proven to

258
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,680
be successful yet. Um, and it's

259
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
obviously replacing something else that

260
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,200
maybe isn't the most successful, but in

261
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
some case it's there because it is

262
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,959
teaching someone something. Um, so

263
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
there's this idea that if you introduce

264
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,920
something new, you have no evidence to

265
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
back up whether or not it will actually

266
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
be beneficial. Good. So people are

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,320
riskaverse. you use the phrase was like

268
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,040
we know this thing in schools teaches

269
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,000
someone something. Um there might even

270
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,200
be sort of a lower threshold of

271
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,680
acceptability which is something like we

272
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,760
know this thing works in schools like

273
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,519
sometimes a thing works in schools

274
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,519
because people learn something.

275
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,800
Sometimes it works in schools because

276
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,399
like kids are quiet and well behaved and

277
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,720
busy and other things like that. like

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,040
not even really learning just you know

279
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
just like like like you know if you've

280
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,320
kept a bunch of adolescent like if

281
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,440
you've kept hundreds of adolescents in a

282
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,320
building safe and for a day like you've

283
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,399
kind of made school work um in at the

284
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
you know at at sort of the one of the

285
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,760
baseline levels of it. So there's

286
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,160
practices that we would consider sort of

287
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,600
sort of baseline not because they teach

288
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,920
but because they work to do the other

289
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,920
things that we ask schools to do. Um

290
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
yeah, Mari I think we also talked a

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,440
little bit about fear which I think it's

292
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
part of the risk averse aspect not only

293
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
from families but the student themselves

294
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,800
the professor the teachers as well um

295
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,360
and it was also an aspect I don't know I

296
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,920
would put it as credibility u because

297
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,440
even students if something is too

298
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,120
different they're going to feel like oh

299
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
this is not serious enough like I would

300
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,040
rather just have a lecture because this

301
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,600
is something I've seen being done before

302
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,600
so they don't and and you and you know

303
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
how to do it you know how to There's a

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,320
bunch of people who go into school that

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,800
are that sort of are like look there's a

306
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,279
deal here like you tell me to do things

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,720
that I know how to do and I will do

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,720
those things. Um you know sometimes in

309
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,440
lower performing schools that can be

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,920
expressed as like give me a set of tasks

311
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,600
that I understand how to do and like the

312
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,360
day will be quiet and function. um uh or

313
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
in in high performing schools it can be

314
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
something like give me a set of tasks

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,399
that I know how to get an A on I won't

316
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,760
have my parents call you um and and sort

317
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,560
of cause difficulties and things like

318
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,399
that but it's the same kind of deal um

319
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,240
new routines break up that arrangement

320
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
um and students can be some of the most

321
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,279
conservative stakeholders in these

322
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
systems you know people can come in

323
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,680
being like look at this new awesome

324
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,120
thing we might have us try and they'll

325
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,720
be like I don't know how to get I don't

326
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
know how to get an A doing that. Why

327
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,040
don't we go back to the thing that I

328
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,360
know how to get an A doing? What was the

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,200
um there were early on in the days of

330
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
MOOs, there were like a handful of

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
people that were trying different things

332
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
and there would always be learners that

333
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,920
would show up in these like, you know,

334
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
somewhat novel enterprise being like

335
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
this isn't real learning. This isn't

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
serious learning. Why don't we get back

337
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
to what we were supposed to be? It's

338
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,680
like my guy, it's optional. Like no one

339
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,680
is making you be here. Like go, you

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,800
know, um like if you want something

341
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,399
else, you know, there's zillions of

342
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,040
these courses being developed. There's I

343
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,000
think there's something in that um in uh

344
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,320
in the chapter on muks about that. Yeah,

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,120
I think teachers could also get

346
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,600
overwhelmed by introducing entirely new

347
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,600
novel idea

348
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,880
especially if that novel idea like what

349
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,240
if you have to change the curriculum?

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,519
What if you have to change the schedule?

351
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,519
What if you have to change your grading

352
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,680
arrangements? like a new technology

353
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,079
cannot like if it's actually changing

354
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,399
the way teaching happens, it's probably

355
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,720
trying to simultaneously change a whole

356
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,560
bunch of things that are going on. Um,

357
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,360
which can be like which can be

358
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,959
stressful, which can be difficult. Um,

359
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,560
so a lot of teachers have to prepare

360
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,600
students for a certain exam at the end

361
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
of the school year, whether it's like

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
the standardized assessments or AP

363
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
exams, and they can't really afford to

364
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,880
like go off trail. um and they need to

365
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
like stick with what they know because

366
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,360
they that's what gets the results which

367
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,600
which means that different parts of

368
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,600
school systems have different amounts of

369
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,200
flexibility to try really new things.

370
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,560
Like one of the fun things about being a

371
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
history teacher in Massachusetts is that

372
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
until this year when we just launched an

373
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
eighth grade civics assessment, there

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,639
was no standardized assessment, you

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,880
know, and I mean there has been some

376
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,920
like SAT2s in history, AP US history and

377
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,680
things like that, but they're usually

378
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,800
not like the centerpiece of people's

379
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,200
efforts. And so history, social studies,

380
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
electives for seniors off um and then

381
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
anything in the sort of co-curricular

382
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,639
domains, theater, arts, dance, physical

383
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,760
education, like a lot of times those are

384
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,480
places where you can do really different

385
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,160
kinds of things. Um the mathematics

386
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,839
sequence is often a place where you're

387
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,079
like, "Oh boy, like this really better

388
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,519
work." Um not only that, you know, not

389
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,440
only because people need to do well in

390
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
math, but like if you don't get eighth

391
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,399
grade math, nth grade math is really

392
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,320
hard. you know, if you like if you don't

393
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
get earth science, you might still be

394
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
okay in physics or something like that

395
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
because they're just sort of

396
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
sufficiently different and so forth. So,

397
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
the stakes in different parts of schools

398
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
are different. Um there's a there's an

399
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,320
old saw in any kind of education

400
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,639
development that um the elementary

401
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,000
school curriculum is pretty locked.

402
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,120
There's just some reading and math and a

403
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,519
handful of other things people need to

404
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,199
do. The high school curriculum is pretty

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,959
locked because these tracks and exams

406
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,199
and things like that. And middle school

407
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,440
is maybe the most open-ended space. So

408
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,680
quite a few new products for education

409
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,839
will find themselves in middle schools.

410
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,519
Not because like you know 12-year-olds

411
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
are a particularly great group to

412
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
embrace new ideas or something like

413
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,399
that. It's just like that curriculum is

414
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,959
more flexible in some ways than others

415
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
are.

416
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:49,120
Um so that we have this example of

417
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,040
Quizlet. You know, I feel like um uh the

418
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
the connectivist mukes that we talked

419
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
about before are sort of the

420
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,000
quintessential example of like here's

421
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,839
some really cool ideas, some really cool

422
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,160
technologies, potentially very different

423
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,000
solving some very meaningful problems

424
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,959
that that higher education had not

425
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,959
figured out good ways of solving and you

426
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,880
know were essentially rejected by the

427
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,720
higher education system. a sort of spark

428
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,720
of interest for a little while and then

429
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,199
people are like this is weird, this is

430
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,920
different, what we're doing is fine. Um,

431
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,560
and all this stuff kind of

432
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,639
died. So the question then is are there

433
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
strategies that would get you past the

434
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,160
curse of the familiar? Are there things

435
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
that you could do in developing products

436
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,279
and services that would let you use

437
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,760
technology to do really different kinds

438
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,600
of teaching and learning? Um, and I

439
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,360
think there are two strategies that have

440
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,279
some evidence behind them that they

441
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,760
might work. One of them Mario alluded to

442
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,279
before, which is build a technology that

443
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,680
starts somewhere familiar and goes to a

444
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,040
different place somehow. Um, like you

445
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,639
enter it and you're like, I know what

446
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,079
that is. And then you're like, whoa, I

447
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,160
could do these other kinds of things,

448
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,920
too. Um, the second sort of crucial idea

449
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,959
is something around cultivating

450
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,759
professional communities. The easy part

451
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,759
of scaling online technologies is like

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,680
getting people to download stuff. It

453
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,680
like it's not that difficult to get an

454
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
app on people's machines on schools

455
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
machines. It's not that difficult to

456
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,399
get, you know, millions of YouTube views

457
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,120
or other kinds of things like that.

458
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,440
What's really hard is not scaling

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
technology, but scaling community. How

460
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,720
do you get groups of educators to share

461
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,120
the ideas for new practices with other

462
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,079
people? But there are a couple of

463
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,959
organizations um that have done a a

464
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,120
demonstrabably good job of not only

465
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,440
scaling their product but scaling the

466
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,560
ideas, the pedagogies, the new ideas

467
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,680
underneath that. So um the two I like to

468
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,079
talk about are Scratch and Desmos. Um

469
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,519
they've probably made the most progress

470
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,360
on this.

471
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:57,680
Scratch maybe has never achieved like a

472
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,880
familiar place to start, but they have

473
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,800
thought a lot about entry points about

474
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
how you get people in for a while. You

475
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,400
know, Seymour Papard had this famous

476
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
line that you want technologies with low

477
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,760
floors and high ceilings. Yousef

478
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,360
referred to it a few times ago. You want

479
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,559
something that like is pretty easy to

480
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,480
get people into um and also things that

481
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,679
they can really do awesome stuff later

482
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,760
on. Um uh sometimes the Scratch people

483
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,520
have also talked about narrow entryways.

484
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
You want people to kind of get into the

485
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,679
software, like get into the platform,

486
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,440
have some more clear ideas about what to

487
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,640
do with a few things and then go other

488
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,120
places. Um for a while, uh Scratch was

489
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,039
experimenting with these micro worlds

490
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,520
where you would get a smaller set of

491
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,919
blocks, a smaller set of sprites, and

492
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,200
they would be connected to some um to

493
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,640
what they thought young people would be

494
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,720
interested in. So I think there was a

495
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,559
standup comedy micro world. There was a

496
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
fashion micro world. There was a dance

497
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,080
micro world. And it was like don't learn

498
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
everything about Scratch. Like just

499
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,520
learn enough to make there be a little

500
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,720
standup comedy routine or to make there

501
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,080
be a little dance or things like that.

502
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
So you have, you know, a set of sprites

503
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
that are relevant to that. You have a

504
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
set of blocks that are relevant to that.

505
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,160
And once you learn that smaller part, go

506
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,000
into more complex things. Um, a thing

507
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,760
that I think Scratch has done a very

508
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,919
good job of is scaling community. is

509
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,640
basically saying, you know, is

510
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,120
acknowledging that if educators just

511
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,960
download Scratch into their machines,

512
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,640
that is not enough to get over the curse

513
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,880
of the familiar. Like they know exactly

514
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,480
what happens when people who don't sort

515
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,919
of understand the pedagogy of Scratch

516
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,280
download Scratch. And you heard Yousef

517
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,440
talking about it, they just turn it into

518
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
like a recipe book. So instead of having

519
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
it be this place for computational

520
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,799
creativity, you see all the students in

521
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
lockep, you know, all building the same

522
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,640
greeting card or all building the same

523
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,039
roller coaster or whatever it is. Um, so

524
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,960
they have, you know, all kinds of

525
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,960
programs that are developed for

526
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,240
educators. They have a world scratch day

527
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
where people get together. They have

528
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,559
Scratch educator meetups. They had for a

529
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,799
while minutes with Mitch, um, which were

530
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,720
Mitch Resnik like giving short talks

531
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,880
about ideas and things and Natalie's

532
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,200
notes. They have other kinds of projects

533
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,000
and tools and things like that. Um, a

534
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,799
big part of them is meant to get Scratch

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,039
educators connected with each other. Um

536
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,760
if you and a few studies have done this.

537
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,160
If you interview teachers about how they

538
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,240
adopt new pedagogies, the number one

539
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,640
answer they will give you is from other

540
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,400
teachers. Um the main reason why a

541
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,039
teacher is willing to try a new practice

542
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,200
is because they see uh that practice

543
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,520
working in somebody else's classroom.

544
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,960
Ideally someone who teaches in a place

545
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,200
like them, in a grade like them, in a

546
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,120
subject like them that's near them. Um

547
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,360
what that means is that any of these

548
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,280
kinds of curriculum change, technology

549
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
change problems are really peer learning

550
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,120
problems. You have to figure out how do

551
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
you get teachers to share with one

552
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,400
another. That is just immensely more

553
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,400
complicated um than it is in to to get

554
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
software to be disseminated widely. Um

555
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
it's particularly difficult in most

556
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,960
places in the world in education

557
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
definitely in the United States in

558
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,320
education because there are there are

559
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,000
weak professional that like the

560
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,240
professional organization level of

561
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,280
education is really weak. Um if you were

562
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,200
like man I want all of the emergency

563
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,280
room doctors to do something different

564
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
and better you'd be like oh let's go to

565
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,000
whatever it's called the American

566
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Academy of Emergency Physicians or

567
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,320
something like that. If you wanted all

568
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
the pediatricians to do something

569
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,440
different, you'd go to the American

570
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,400
Academy of Pediatricians and you would

571
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,240
convince some senior steering committee

572
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
of the American Academy of Pediatricians

573
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,919
that we're going to do this new practice

574
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
and they would be like, "Yes, this is a

575
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,919
good practice. Let's all do that." And

576
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,840
then that group has a journal pediatrics

577
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,760
and all the pediatricians read it and

578
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
you can and you can get people even

579
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
though there are, you know, thousands

580
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,679
and thousands of pediatricians in the

581
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
country, you can get them to be like,

582
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,520
"Okay, this is a new and better idea."

583
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,679
education does not have that

584
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,919
professional organization level. There's

585
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
there's no authoritative body that says

586
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,720
this is a good way to teach second

587
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
graders or this is a good way to teach

588
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
math or reading. Like we you know um we

589
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,159
have teachers unions which organize

590
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,520
teachers in a bunch of places in the US

591
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,960
but they and they sometimes have a

592
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,440
professional learning role but usually

593
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,120
not this kind of authoritative one. Um

594
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
sometime they're organizations like the

595
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,320
National Council of Teachers of

596
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
Mathematics or the National Councils of

597
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
Teachers of English and they sort of

598
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,799
have some things that are like this but

599
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
they're they're very weak compared to

600
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,400
other professions and other kinds of

601
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
things.

602
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Um, how many of you use Desmos in

603
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
schools? So, we're just Okay, a lot more

604
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,880
now. This is way more than you would

605
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,640
have said five or six years ago. Um,

606
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,480
Desmos was originally developed as a

607
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,760
graphing calculator. Like its earliest

608
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,640
functions were just we're going to um

609
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,440
make a TI84 available on every machine

610
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,080
for free. Um and one of the brilliant

611
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,000
things they did was they got um instead

612
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,919
of consumers to pay for it, they got

613
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,400
testing companies and publishers to pay

614
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,600
for it. Um and what that meant was is

615
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,039
that I mean that was the way they could

616
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
make a high-quality project available

617
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,440
for free without ads, without

618
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,760
subscriptions, without um um costs to

619
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,159
the education system. And of course, you

620
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,360
know, for anybody who's used a TI84

621
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,960
before, you look at something like this

622
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,400
and you're like, "Yeah, I know what to

623
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
do there." Like, I'm going to start

624
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,240
teaching in equations and it's going to

625
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,080
start graphing them for me. Um, and you,

626
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,159
you know, I mean, for those of you who

627
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,400
grew up in affluent environments, like

628
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,840
replacing a TI84 might not be a big

629
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,200
deal. Um, but there are lots of

630
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,559
households and lots of families where

631
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,400
like an $80 cost, $120 cost, a big deal.

632
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,600
Um, like a real obstacle to kids

633
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,679
education schools, you know, where they

634
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,960
just have like TI84s in boxes and they

635
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,400
hand them out at the beginning of class

636
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
and put them back in the box at the end

637
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,240
of class and things like that. Um, but

638
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,679
you could give just this to lots of math

639
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,919
teachers and lots of students and they

640
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,480
would be like,"Great, I totally know

641
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,480
what to do with this." Um, and then on

642
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
top of that, there was all kinds of

643
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
other crazy things that you could do

644
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,159
with Desmos. You know, one of the things

645
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,280
they do every year is have an art, maybe

646
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,200
they still don't do it, but for a while

647
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
they would have art competitions, um,

648
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
where you have people who create

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,840
drawings using graphs and things like

650
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
that. I don't know what what were what

651
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,799
were the kinds of things that you did

652
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,440
with Desmos that were very different

653
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,400
from a graphing calculator in in for

654
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
those of you who raised your

655
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,880
hands. I think this is something you

656
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,880
could do on a graphing calculator, but

657
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,440
that was made so much easier was just

658
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,520
like um seeing just like different

659
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,159
versions of the same graph like

660
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,320
simultaneously or being able to like

661
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,520
slide the coefficients and the

662
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,200
variables. Yep. And so um modeling is a

663
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,720
term that a lot of math teachers might

664
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,720
use to describe that like you can look

665
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
at the same equation you know across a

666
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,520
range of parameters and things like

667
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,000
that. It was a sometimes we had like uh

668
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,919
TI was it

669
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,720
TI3 um so it was easy it's a lot easier

670
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
to input stuff into decimals when

671
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,840
compared to like traditional

672
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
calculators. Yeah. So some of it it just

673
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,520
made some efficiency gains like they

674
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,280
just figured out some ways of doing some

675
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,720
mathematical inputs that are like a

676
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,520
little bit easier if you learn them on a

677
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,679
keyboard than on you know a number pad

678
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,200
like finding intersections of uh two

679
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,640
polomials you just click on it as

680
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
opposed to like let's go through the

681
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,320
directions of how to find it on your

682
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,919
graphing calculator go left go right go

683
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,559
like it just like it's so much less

684
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,120
bandwidth and just to add on to that I

685
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,440
think I heard somewhere I don't remember

686
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,440
when but some technologies like chatb

687
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,760
are like extremely bad for beginners

688
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,840
because it distracts them. In this case,

689
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,840
I I literally made this analogy the

690
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,880
other day. Um I think it was just

691
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,880
yesterday. I was talking to some

692
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,159
somebody about this class and I said a

693
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,440
calculator sometimes if you don't know

694
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,159
how to use it, it'll be more distracting

695
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,200
and helpful to you. And for some people,

696
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,440
Desmos was easier in my classrooms than

697
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,960
a traditional graph. Yeah. get that if

698
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,640
you you sort of lower the barrier to to

699
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,000
like learning the interface like

700
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,080
learning the interface is not useful to

701
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,520
anyone. What's useful is doing math and

702
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,640
if you if the barrier to learning the

703
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,159
interface is high then you're spending a

704
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
bunch of your math time not doing math.

705
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,480
You're doing like you know user

706
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,080
interface on you know 1980s era

707
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,919
calculators. Um I mean yeah the

708
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,159
calculator calculators are a remarkable

709
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
piece of technology. They they cost like

710
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,080
50 cents to make or something like that

711
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,360
and they sell them for $100 because they

712
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,000
have a bunch because they have a like

713
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,520
regulatory lock in um because you know

714
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,960
they you get the testing companies to

715
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,240
agree to mandate them and then the

716
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,760
curriculum companies have to mandate

717
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,080
them and then Texas Instruments can

718
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,360
charge a hundred bucks. Um for something

719
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:23,039
that should be a lot less. Um all right.

720
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,240
So, what are some things that Desmos did

721
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,880
to try to get folks um excited about

722
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:35,400
some of the other capacities in

723
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:39,760
um in in Desmos um is in addition to

724
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,000
promoting the technology of Desmos um

725
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,400
their leadership promoted alternative

726
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,480
approaches to teaching mathematics. Um

727
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,600
so Dan Meyer who was the chief academic

728
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,200
officer of Desmos um he did a bunch of

729
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,400
teaching um in low-inccome schools and

730
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,679
in schools with a bunch of kids who

731
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,679
would have been pretty turned off to

732
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,440
math. Um thought a lot about like what

733
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,200
kinds of pedagogies really engaged

734
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,080
students and came up with this um

735
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,440
framework he called threeact math. Um it

736
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,760
was very mediabased. So um he would take

737
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,919
a picture of himself shooting a

738
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,600
basketball. Um, so you'd watch a video

739
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
of him shooting a free throw and about

740
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,360
halfway through the shot he would stop

741
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,720
it. Um, and that's all the video that

742
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,720
you would see. Actually, I'll give you

743
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,640
my favorite example of it. Like, do you

744
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,360
do you remember in geometry you are

745
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
always encountering like hexagonal fish

746
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,320
tanks and things like that? You're

747
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
always encountering like these shapes

748
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,919
that like would never exist. So, he like

749
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,559
found a hexagonal fish tank um and gets

750
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,720
a hose and holds the hose on top of the

751
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,520
fish tank and just makes a video of 30

752
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,279
seconds of just water filling up. Um and

753
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,880
usually when he shows this video at some

754
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,840
point some kid is like, "How long is

755
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,159
this going to take?" And he goes,

756
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,880
"Exactly." Um and then you sort of stop

757
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,559
the video there. Um but it kind of, you

758
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
know, these videos inspire like a

759
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,080
natural curiosity. How long does it take

760
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,559
the fish tank to fill up? Like will the

761
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,000
basketball go in? Um, and then what he

762
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,440
does, that's the first act, is sort of

763
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,679
setting up some kind of problem. The

764
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,039
second act is trying to figure out

765
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,559
what's going on in the setting. So,

766
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,559
students have a chance to ask a bunch of

767
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,320
questions. Um, how far away was this

768
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,080
person from the basket? How high is the

769
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,760
basket? How fast is the ball moving?

770
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,279
What is the ark? How big is the fish

771
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,039
tank? How wide is the fish tank? How

772
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,720
tall is the fish tank? What is the angle

773
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,400
on each side of the fish tank? How much

774
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,840
how wide is the hose? How much water is

775
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,559
coming out of the hose? All these kinds

776
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,120
of things. Um, some of some of these

777
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,640
details Dan or other teachers will give

778
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,720
to their students and some they won't.

779
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,400
Um, and then they sort of agree on a

780
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,760
question or the teacher kind of imposes

781
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,039
a question. Okay, the question is going

782
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,640
to be how long is this going to take to

783
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,120
fill up? And I'm going to give you these

784
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,640
pieces of information. Um, now because

785
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,480
it's a realworld environment, it's like

786
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,039
it's actually kind of mathematically

787
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,520
impossible to determine the exact answer

788
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,120
to these questions. um you know like the

789
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,559
the amount of water that's flowing

790
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,640
through the hose through a municipal

791
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,480
water system is not like a completely

792
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,720
predictable amount that's coming out

793
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,399
every time. Um you know he'll give some

794
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
measurements of the tank but the like

795
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,080
the tank probably wasn't measured to the

796
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,080
hundth of a millimeter or something like

797
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,240
that. Um so students start creating

798
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,440
models. Um they say all right well I

799
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,640
think it's going to be this you know

800
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
here's what I know and and sometimes

801
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,200
there's a little instruction there like

802
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
oh so to figure this out you're going to

803
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,440
have to calculate the area of a

804
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
hexagonal solid. Okay. um here is the

805
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
formula that you need to do that and

806
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
here's why it work and then you sort of

807
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,720
figure out these other things. So then

808
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,919
the third act um is Dan will show the

809
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,600
video again um and the water will be

810
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,880
pouring into the tank and the water will

811
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,480
be filling up. Usually he sort of

812
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,559
accelerates it so it goes a little bit

813
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,159
faster and he puts a clock in the corner

814
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,480
of the video. Now all of the students

815
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,159
have made some kind of prediction about

816
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,520
when they think the tank will fill up

817
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,000
but it's pretty much impossible to

818
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,159
predict exactly. Um, and he's got great

819
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
videos of kids watching these sort of

820
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,360
third act videos where you sort of see

821
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,960
like

822
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,240
h like their time they predict to go off

823
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
and then at some point in the middle

824
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,760
middle of the video like you know a

825
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,679
third of the class cheers. Yeah. Because

826
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,720
their time was like roughly right or

827
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,919
something like that. And it's just a

828
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,919
sort of great moment to be like like

829
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
typically when you get an answer right

830
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,760
in math class you don't like stand up

831
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,279
and cheer and stuff like that. Um but uh

832
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,440
you know there's a there's a few key

833
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,039
features of the pedagogy. First of all,

834
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,840
um, one things he talks about is it

835
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,919
dials up the math slowly. Um, so an

836
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,080
exercise like this starts at a level of

837
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,080
intuition and questioning that even if

838
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,720
you don't really understand polomial

839
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,279
functions or you know complex geometry

840
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,720
of solids, well, you can still ask basic

841
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,720
questions about it. You can still make

842
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,480
observations about what's important. And

843
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,240
then you sort of ratchet the mathematics

844
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,279
up slowly until you get to the point

845
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,200
where you're like working with

846
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,960
particular equations and functions and

847
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
numbers and those kinds of things. um

848
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,799
and that it's impossible to be right.

849
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,200
Like everyone in the room is just trying

850
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,799
to be the least wrong that they can um

851
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,240
and making a series of assumptions which

852
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,760
are which you know hopefully get more

853
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,679
and more reasonable as kids get more and

854
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,679
more proficient mathematically um but

855
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,679
will never be perfect. So um Desmos is a

856
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,760
to you know hopefully you can see how a

857
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,600
tool like the slider that Osel described

858
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,120
before might be quite useful in building

859
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,120
mathematical models of how long it takes

860
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,360
to fill up a tank with a hose and other

861
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,600
kinds of things like that. Um Dan Meyer

862
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,559
has given talks at math conferences in

863
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,480
all 50 states. Um he goes around to

864
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,799
places all the time. Not only Probably

865
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,720
even more important than Dan going to

866
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,679
all 50 states to give talks is you can

867
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,679
still go to math

868
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,799
conference in all 50 states and someone

869
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,279
will be giving a presentation on

870
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,080
three-act math tasks. Um because not

871
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,279
just Dan but other mathematics educators

872
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,960
have taken up the mantle of these ideas.

873
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,960
um probably in those talks they'll

874
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,480
explain how you can use Desmos for doing

875
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,640
these things. And so all of a sudden you

876
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,799
have not just a new technology to do

877
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,880
math, but you have a whole community of

878
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,799
people that are sharing new practices of

879
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,480
how to do it. Just like in Scratch has a

880
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,720
whole community of people who are trying

881
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,240
to say let's not just teach computer

882
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,000
programming as puzzle solving, let's

883
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,919
teach it as computational creativity and

884
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,760
things like that. I I want to emphasize

885
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,399
to you like I mean these are like

886
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,080
powerful powerful strategies for

887
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,559
changing teaching and learning and

888
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,799
they're super hard and time consuming

889
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,360
and energy consuming. They require

890
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,679
charismatic leaders. They require really

891
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,600
good ideas. They require technologies

892
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,000
that sort of fit with pedagogy. They

893
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,000
require convincing educators. You know

894
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,360
these riskaverse educators who you

895
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,440
described who are preparing their

896
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,520
students for math tests like here's a

897
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,159
better way of doing this. you know, nuke

898
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,159
a part of your geometry solids units and

899
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,840
try this new thing. So, there's a whole

900
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,880
lot that goes into it, but those I think

901
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,440
are sort of the two key strategies um

902
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,279
for for how we might get past the curse

903
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,200
of the familiar. Um start with the

904
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,039
familiar then go new places and think

905
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,559
about not just scaling technology but

906
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,720
scaling community, cultivating

907
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,480
professional communities. What

908
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,360
observations or thoughts or questions do

909
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,360
you have about those ideas?

910
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,440
Yeah, one more. Sort of like a spoiler

911
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,399
to my essay, but I I did I did mention

912
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,600
that um I'll be as vague as possible.

913
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,080
The target the target um that I was

914
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,799
recommending my technology to actually

915
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,679
had the infrastructure

916
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:17,440
implemented like five years before COVID

917
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,519
and they started doing a lot of

918
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,360
professional teaching within the entire

919
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,080
district. And so by the time CO came

920
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,159
around, they were ready for um distance

921
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,760
learning without necessarily preparing

922
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,440
for that. Um and they just happened to

923
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,440
have like the resources necessary

924
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,440
because everybody was involved. And I

925
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,840
remember like there would be teachers

926
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,360
like having separate meetings just to

927
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,840
talk about like what went well, what

928
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,000
didn't go well. Um, and then they like I

929
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,960
was one of the volunteers during the the

930
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,279
last accreditation self-study and I was

931
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,120
in there like listening to sort of what

932
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,760
happened during the pandemic like this

933
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,640
was

934
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,039
um at the end of like co um and then

935
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
they were recruiting for that self-study

936
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,480
but I was able to listen in on that and

937
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,679
it was really cool to see like the

938
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,000
community that built up. Yeah, it it is

939
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,000
it is impossible to change teaching

940
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,399
practice in schools without communities

941
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,080
of educators teaching and learning with

942
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,679
one another. Like every instructional

943
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,600
improvement problem in a school is in

944
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,080
some dimension a peer learning problem.

945
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,720
Um and you you know you could imagine

946
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,519
like how many education technology

947
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,200
startups have as one of their first five

948
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,880
hires someone who's really good at

949
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,679
facilitating peer learning amongst

950
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,279
educators. Like no one, right? like you

951
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,960
need someone who can like like you need

952
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,640
a front-end person and a backend person

953
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,480
and someone who knows pedagogy and a

954
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,600
marketing guy or finance guy or lady or

955
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,360
something like that like you're just

956
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,320
like there's just organizations that are

957
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,679
not intuitively equipped um for those

958
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,080
kinds of things you know when Andy is

959
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,840
starting Quizlet I mean he's a high

960
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,679
school he doesn't know anything he just

961
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,760
like knows how to like make flashc cards

962
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,279
online um and part of what their

963
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,039
organization needed to build over time

964
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,640
was was you know people who could

965
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,159
interface with schools not just to sell

966
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,519
to schools but to help help them think

967
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,039
about like what could different look

968
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,960
like here? What you know where do we fit

969
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,720
into practice? How do we train teachers

970
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,639
or have students become better at using

971
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,800
these things? Um I feel like um this

972
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,119
whole like talk is about how like

973
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,720
difficult this can be and like even with

974
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,879
these two ideas that you've brought up

975
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,639
like this still requires like a lot of

976
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,200
people buy in and just like other people

977
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,359
supporting it. makes me think like about

978
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,520
how difficult this can be for schools

979
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,000
that like aren't out of public schools

980
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,679
and like even like you have your charter

981
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,520
schools that then have their own set of

982
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,240
curricula and if you're trying to really

983
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,240
gain this type of support nationwide if

984
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,240
you have like this whole subset of

985
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,839
schools that are like avoiding your

986
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,960
technology like it can make things

987
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,399
really hard. Um, like thinking about

988
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,720
like like because I had written my paper

989
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,000
to like my high school which was like

990
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,240
like a Catholic high school in

991
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,760
Philadelphia and like those schools

992
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,040
don't do anything to try and improve

993
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,560
schools cuz like they are just

994
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,320
struggling to like keep kids in the

995
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,599
schools. Yeah. So like thinking about

996
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,680
trying to like improve a system that

997
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,440
like can't even look that far. is like

998
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,800
really interesting too of like those

999
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,400
teachers don't have time to like

1000
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,760
cultivate that professional community

1001
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,320
because they're just trying to cultivate

1002
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,320
like a school community or I mean almost

1003
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,599
every school has a certain amount of

1004
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,280
time to do professional learning amongst

1005
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,680
faculty like that's baked into most

1006
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,320
schools but you have like there's only

1007
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,480
one block of that um that is the that is

1008
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,240
what you'll use to improve your

1009
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,480
assessment practices to address chronic

1010
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,560
absenteeism to deal with violence in

1011
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,200
schools to take on a new state

1012
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,960
initiative about sex education to do,

1013
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,920
you know, a dozen different things that

1014
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,320
might come along. Um, you know, I mean,

1015
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,119
Omar described a school that 5 years

1016
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,640
before co happened to decide that like

1017
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,320
online learning, distance learning was

1018
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,680
like a good thing for them to work on,

1019
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,680
but it might have been equally

1020
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,240
reasonable for them to work on phonics

1021
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,400
instruction or executive functioning or

1022
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,520
any one of a dozen other things that

1023
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,960
helps improve schools. Um so yeah think

1024
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,640
you know thinking about like what are

1025
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,520
the what are the resources that

1026
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,280
institutions have to make themselves

1027
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,200
better and to make the kinds of changes

1028
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,079
that are needed for new practices to

1029
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,839
work. Um

1030
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,240
we talked a lot about like cultivating

1031
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,720
professional communities. Do you think

1032
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,359
that the professional communities so

1033
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,400
with teachers for example cultivating

1034
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,839
that is enough or do we also need to

1035
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,520
cultivate like the students communities

1036
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,280
as well because I was surprised when

1037
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,359
reading the chapter that students

1038
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,640
themselves sometimes are also kind of

1039
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,839
like afraid or concerned about using

1040
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,359
this new technology. Yeah. I so I de I

1041
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,520
mean it's exciting to hear like what

1042
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,160
Omar talked about about bringing

1043
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,160
students in on these kinds of change

1044
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,200
initiatives. It would be you know

1045
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,599
there's almost every edtech company has

1046
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,920
some kind of ambassador program which is

1047
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,440
hiring a group of teachers to be like

1048
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,640
the folks who go to these conferences

1049
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,560
and share what they're doing with other

1050
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,400
people. I don't know of any technology

1051
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,280
company that has a student ambassador

1052
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,720
program. Um they're I mean they're you

1053
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,160
know one reason is that the like the

1054
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,440
teachers stay and the students leave

1055
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,000
which is good. That's what the students

1056
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,400
are supposed to do. Um like you probably

1057
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,040
have to be a certain age to be kind of

1058
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,240
useful doing like like a first grade

1059
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,599
ambassador would probably do some

1060
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,000
interesting things but like is not that

1061
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,200
helpful for um for what they can

1062
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,680
accomplish. Um but I you know but I do

1063
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,280
think that generally

1064
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,359
speaking school systems change agents

1065
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,160
tend to underestimate students as

1066
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,960
potential partners. Um because when you

1067
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,320
you know when you get them really

1068
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,079
engaged they can be they can be

1069
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,680
transformative in institutions when

1070
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,160
students get together and be like oh we

1071
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,839
should do this sometimes that's when

1072
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,599
faculty light bulbs go off and go yeah

1073
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,079
you're interested in that like

1074
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:54,000
absolutely like let's do it. I'm I'm

1075
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,040
asking because I met a like this girl

1076
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,640
she's doing her masters at um the

1077
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,760
graduate school of education in Harvard

1078
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,320
and in Brazil a few years back she was

1079
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,000
supposed to start like giving an

1080
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,240
entrepreneurship course to like middle

1081
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,599
schoolers. She wanted to use Figma like

1082
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,119
to do it very interactive you know

1083
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,839
experiential and professor like teachers

1084
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,839
were completely closed off to the idea

1085
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
and then she simply bypassed them and

1086
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:23,359
started reaching out to students and

1087
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,079
they loved it and it worked so well that

1088
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,839
like the excitement from the students

1089
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,599
convinced teachers themselves to

1090
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,040
actually give it a go because like if

1091
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,880
there's one thing they have in common is

1092
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,200
they're really concerned and like they

1093
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,040
care about students, right? So she ended

1094
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,200
up even giving like a TED talk about how

1095
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,960
she believes this whole like

1096
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,119
transformation is going to come from

1097
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,520
students. Yep. Uh so that's why I was

1098
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,480
interested in like you know we do that

1099
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,119
less than we could. Yeah. the the exact

1100
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,119
nature of the technology matters too.

1101
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,960
The more the technology the more like

1102
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,119
the business model of the technology has

1103
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,359
some kind of like premium or

1104
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,720
introduction kind of model like I don't

1105
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,280
know if you wanted to implement

1106
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,520
something like with robotics in a school

1107
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,280
and the robotics kits are expensive.

1108
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,960
It's pretty hard to be like hey kids

1109
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,640
like go get your own robotics kits and

1110
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
we'll like go around the system like

1111
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,839
somebody needs to buy the robotics kits.

1112
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,520
Um, you know, part of what makes like

1113
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,200
the example you gave of Figma works is

1114
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,920
that Figma has a kind of built-in

1115
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,320
premium model as a consumer product that

1116
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,920
educators can sort of piggy back on to

1117
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,280
to try those things out. But yeah, I

1118
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,440
mean, I would say anybody who has a

1119
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,960
change strategy in schools, if your

1120
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,960
students are part of that change

1121
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,079
strategy, it's pretty likely to be

1122
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,520
better than if they're not. Um, yeah,

1123
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,440
related to that, I know that Wolfford

1124
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,200
Technologies, which created Mathematica,

1125
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,839
has a student ambassador program that I

1126
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,760
did in high school. So you like present

1127
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,119
at their conference and like I don't

1128
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,440
know talk about it to all your friends

1129
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,119
and host webinars and things. So yeah

1130
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,200
that's one example of that. No that's I

1131
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,359
I had I had not known that but that's a

1132
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,480
that's you know and and again like yeah

1133
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,240
Wolf's in a pretty competitive space

1134
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,040
where of of different kinds of

1135
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,480
mathematics software where where

1136
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,000
absolutely cultivating student

1137
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,240
preferences could totally make a

1138
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,119
difference. Um, all right. Let's talk

1139
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,680
about another

1140
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,359
um uh let's let's do another one of

1141
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,440
these challenges since I'm trying to

1142
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,520
double up this week. Um, which is the

1143
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,839
edtech Matthew effect.

1144
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,240
Um, which is really supposed to be here

1145
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:29,240
somewhere. Ah, this is what I used. Um,

1146
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,240
okay.

1147
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:36,119
Um, here

1148
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:39,839
are here's sort of three variants

1149
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:42,079
of of mythologies that people have about

1150
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,079
technology in schools. Um, one is that

1151
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,280
edtech will destroy the system. We've

1152
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,160
talked about how that probably won't

1153
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,400
happen. Um, and instead um, new

1154
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,920
technologies domesticate education.

1155
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,240
Actually, that article that Yousef

1156
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,680
shared um, I thought it was Mimi and I

1157
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,400
who came up with this metaphor,

1158
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,119
particularly Mimi. Um, but that article

1159
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,200
that uh, Yousef shared of Seymour Papert

1160
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,520
responding to Taek and Cuban had a very

1161
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,560
similar kind of framing of what schools

1162
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,920
do. I don't think I don't know if they

1163
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,839
exactly use the word domesticate, but

1164
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,119
it's pretty close. Um, like new

1165
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,359
technologies don't come in and blow up

1166
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,040
schools. Um, instead schools take new

1167
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,960
technologies and go, "Okay, you fit

1168
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,359
here." Um, people are always hoping that

1169
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,680
new technologies, a word they really

1170
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,040
like is democratizing. Um, I think

1171
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,560
people like the word democratizing

1172
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,000
because you're not exactly sure what it

1173
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,119
means, but it sounds pretty good. Like,

1174
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,960
it would be better to have more

1175
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,960
democracy, but it's like, is that

1176
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,079
cheaper? Is that more equal? Is that

1177
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,640
more just? Is that better? Um, I'll show

1178
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,040
you in a bit. We really have pretty good

1179
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,880
evidence that new technologies

1180
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,240
disproportionately benefit the

1181
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,440
advantage. They disproportionately

1182
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,960
benefit people with the financial,

1183
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,800
social, and technical capital to take

1184
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,240
advantage of new innovations. So, people

1185
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,760
are always hoping like, oh, this new

1186
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,440
thing, it'll be distributed for free on

1187
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,800
the internet. like the people who are

1188
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,960
good at finding free stuff on the

1189
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,720
internet are affluent people with good

1190
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,319
internet access with discretionary

1191
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,040
leisure time with parents who went to

1192
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:08,000
college all of those kinds of things. um

1193
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,920
uh and and you know so so this is a

1194
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,359
figure that I that I used to describe

1195
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,560
the edtech matthew effect about to say

1196
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,480
it again um that in educational systems

1197
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,119
especially highly unequ unequal ones

1198
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,200
like the United States we assume that

1199
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,040
folks from higher socioeconomic

1200
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,680
backgrounds have better educational

1201
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,079
outcomes you know generically than from

1202
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,400
than folks from low socioeconomic

1203
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,800
outcomes and the hope is that through

1204
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,200
technology innovation like everyone will

1205
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,119
learn but maybe we can build things that

1206
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,640
particularly help this group. This this

1207
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,640
is when people talk about democratizing

1208
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,720
education this is basically like a graph

1209
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,240
of what they mean. Um what actually

1210
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,839
happens though is probably something

1211
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,440
like this. Um which is that new

1212
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,720
innovations disproportionately benefit

1213
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,000
people who are already affluent. And

1214
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,480
they you know a thing which is sort of

1215
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,319
tricky about this is they probably help

1216
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,599
everyone. Um there are not a lot of

1217
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,440
education technologies that we build

1218
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,359
that like really make things worse.

1219
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,280
Maybe there are um but typically they

1220
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,920
just help advantaged people more than

1221
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,440
they help um disadvantaged folks. Here's

1222
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,119
some um so so when we studied massive

1223
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,480
open online courses the the

1224
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,560
democratizing rhetoric was very active.

1225
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,880
Um Udacity for a while like their

1226
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,720
tagline was democratizing education or

1227
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,560
something like that. That's pretty

1228
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,480
unlikely to happen I think. So for

1229
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,680
instance, so so we did these kind of

1230
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,160
cool studies where um all these studies

1231
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,119
were based on the fact that when edex

1232
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,119
was founded and you had to register for

1233
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,440
it, someone was like, "Let's get

1234
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,520
people's addresses." So they would just

1235
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,920
people would type free form their

1236
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,680
addresses into edex. Why did anyone

1237
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,119
collect their addresses? Like I've never

1238
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,440
learned like were they going to mail

1239
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,920
them something? I don't know. But we had

1240
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,200
their addresses.

1241
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,480
Um, uh, through the magic of residential

1242
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,400
segregation, if you know someone's

1243
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,720
address, you can make a pretty good

1244
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,160
guess about how affluent they are, what

1245
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,240
their education level is, or something

1246
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,920
like that. Um, there are these units

1247
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,599
that are called census block tracks,

1248
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,000
which are something like the 1,200 homes

1249
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,400
that are nearest yours. Um, and wherever

1250
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,640
you live, like like the average median

1251
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,880
income of your of the,200 homes around

1252
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,240
you is like pretty close to your and we

1253
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,520
might not be exactly right, but if you

1254
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,880
do it over hundreds of thousands of

1255
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,560
people, it works out pretty well. Um, so

1256
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,280
this is a graph of people's average

1257
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,880
median income at different ages. Um,

1258
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,560
this is all of the people in the United

1259
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,640
States and these are the people who sign

1260
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,800
up for Harvard X and MITx. Um so for

1261
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,160
sure there were people from every

1262
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,000
possible income bracket that you

1263
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,119
imagined who had signed up for Harvard

1264
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,119
MITx courses. Um but at every age level

1265
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,960
they were you know a typical Harvard X

1266
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,440
or MITx participant is going to be

1267
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,240
wealthier than a typical US residents.

1268
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,960
Um this is a I for this is a kind of

1269
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,880
study called a case control study and it

1270
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,640
comes from epidemiology

1271
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,040
um where you're comparing a particular

1272
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,359
group to a whole population and it's

1273
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,560
usually used for like people who get

1274
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,480
viruses. So for folks who hated muks um

1275
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,079
we were basically treating like MOO

1276
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,240
participants as if they had a virus and

1277
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,240
they thought that was pretty funny. Um

1278
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,560
this is the amount of education that

1279
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,240
their uh parents had. Um, and so clearly

1280
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,599
the people who sign up for Harvard X and

1281
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,319
Edex are more educated than the typical

1282
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,839
population. What was the question you

1283
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,319
asked? I was just saying I love how

1284
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:25,760
there's someone who's under 20 with over

1285
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:27,280
$90,000 in medium in their household in

1286
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,839
their in their in the income of the

1287
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,680
census block tract. Okay. So it's not an

1288
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,640
individual. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like

1289
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,599
it's not like they're a bunch of loaded

1290
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:42,000
16y olds who are taking our courses. No,

1291
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:44,000
but if you were 15 or 16 or 17 and you

1292
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,800
were taking a Harvard X class, it was

1293
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,560
very likely um that you were you were

1294
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,640
much more likely to be from a census

1295
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,880
block track with a much higher average

1296
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,000
median income um than comparable um

1297
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,480
Yeah. Yeah. you I mean you could also

1298
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,960
figure like people leave like like it's

1299
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,119
not that people become poorer they like

1300
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,119
move to crummy college neighborhoods you

1301
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,160
know and then their livelihood improves

1302
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,400
over time until they get old. Um like

1303
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,920
the subtitle the long boring subtitle.

1304
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,880
It did have a long boring subtitle. It

1305
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:19,319
meant something. Um what was this? This

1306
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:22,079
was the odds ratio um of

1307
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:24,040
uh these were these were the odds that

1308
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,119
you

1309
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,839
um were

1310
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,760
um oh if you're if you had a parent who

1311
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,520
graduated from college um this was the

1312
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,760
odds that you were more likely to

1313
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,160
complete a class. So for particularly

1314
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,960
people who are the youngest. So actually

1315
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:47,200
once once you for old learners um some

1316
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,280
of their socioeconomic characteristics

1317
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,040
seem to be less predictive of whether or

1318
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,960
not they would be successful in a class

1319
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,359
which you could might you might assume

1320
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,280
to mean something like by the time

1321
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,760
people are 40 years old or something

1322
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,760
like that. Um you know your your initial

1323
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,880
family upbringing maybe matters less for

1324
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,440
the people who are signing up for this

1325
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,960
class. Um but for really young folks um

1326
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
if your parents graduated from college

1327
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,640
you were way more likely um to complete

1328
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,079
the class than if you signed up and your

1329
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,640
parents had not graduated from college

1330
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,720
pres you not presumably because you

1331
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,240
lived in a household in which you both

1332
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,839
had more support at the time that you

1333
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,760
were taking the class and you had grown

1334
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,480
up with many more academic and financial

1335
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,800
supports than other kinds of people. Um

1336
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,599
so you know it was I mean I mean you

1337
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,280
know at like MOO organizations at this

1338
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,640
time were telling stories like we

1339
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,480
mentioned before like the boy genius of

1340
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,760
Ulan Bar about all these people who are

1341
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,280
you know far-flung places who were

1342
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,680
taking courses and being successful and

1343
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,839
all of that was true. Um there were

1344
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,119
people from every walk of life from all

1345
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,119
corners of the world who are really

1346
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,839
successful. It was it was like mukes

1347
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,200
opened a door and a handful of people

1348
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,880
who definitely would have not have

1349
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,720
accessed higher education before walked

1350
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,000
through that door. But the vast majority

1351
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,839
of people who walked through the door

1352
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,839
were already educated, already um

1353
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,040
affluent people. So, you know, maybe

1354
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,800
there's a way that you could describe

1355
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,200
that as democratizing, but it didn't

1356
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,760
seem particularly democratizing to us.

1357
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,520
Um what are some um this was my uh

1358
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,000
doctoral research which I'll summarize

1359
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,839
quickly. So you know just like in just

1360
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,599
like today there's all these ideas like

1361
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,119
man AI is going to transform education

1362
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,640
and just like 10 years ago there was all

1363
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,880
these man mukes are going to transform

1364
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,160
education in 2007208 2009 it was social

1365
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,880
media that was going to transform

1366
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,400
education. It was blogs and wikis and

1367
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,160
peer production. Yeah it sounds silly

1368
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,800
now but believe me at the time people

1369
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,200
thought. Um so we did this kind of cool

1370
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,000
study where we like knocked on the door

1371
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,520
of a company that um let you set up

1372
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,079
wiks. At the time it was called PB

1373
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,440
Works. Um, and we were like, maybe it

1374
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,680
was called PB Wiki and then changed to

1375
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,280
PB Works. And we're like, can we have a

1376
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,760
list of all of your education related

1377
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,960
wiks? And they're like, yeah, sure. Like

1378
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,319
like in theory as something that we

1379
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,920
could have scraped from their website,

1380
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,520
but they just sort of handed it over.

1381
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,440
Um, so that was pretty cool. Now we had

1382
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,640
200,000 wiks that someone had labeled as

1383
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,400
education related. And these weren't

1384
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,839
wikis like Wikipedia that like everyone

1385
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,280
would work on. They would be like a

1386
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,280
class or a school or something like that

1387
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,160
would foster these wiks. So we took 1%

1388
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,760
of them. Um, and then I hired like a

1389
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,680
small army of uh research assistants to

1390
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,760
figure out what they all were. So we

1391
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,440
like coded the car we like labeled the

1392
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,200
characteristics of them. We did this

1393
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,559
like private investigation work to

1394
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,400
figure out like what school they were

1395
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,400
from. And then if you if you know

1396
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,400
something about a school, you know like

1397
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,839
what neighborhood it's in and how many

1398
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,440
of its students are eligible for free

1399
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,880
and reduced price lunch and what its

1400
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,160
racial divisions are. You can know all

1401
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,760
kinds of sort of demographic

1402
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,319
characteristics. Um, one of the things

1403
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,640
that we focused on, um, was whether or

1404
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:40,000
not they were title one schools where a

1405
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,200
certain percentage of students were

1406
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,680
eligible for free and reduced price

1407
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,000
lunch and those who are not. Um, and we

1408
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,640
basically sort of identified like four

1409
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,559
different types of wikis that people

1410
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,000
created. Um, things that just like

1411
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,520
didn't work, things where there was like

1412
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,359
like someone created it and then like

1413
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,200
never updated it, threw it away,

1414
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,960
whatever, that's fine. Um, things that

1415
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,640
were teacher centered content delivery

1416
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,040
devices. So things that were basically

1417
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,960
just like simple websites. So in some

1418
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,720
respects like definitely what you did

1419
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,800
not want wikis to be like like um uh the

1420
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,400
other one was sort of individual student

1421
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,880
assignment or portfolio like something

1422
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,480
an individual student made um and then a

1423
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,839
sort of collaborative multimedia

1424
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,599
assignment or workplace. So the first

1425
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,920
thing that we figured out is that like

1426
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,680
the vast majority of wiks either didn't

1427
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,920
work or were teacher- centered content

1428
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,839
delivery devices. Um this is a kind of

1429
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,400
curse of the familiar example like you

1430
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,960
can build if you if you give to people

1431
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,680
this never before seen tool to do

1432
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,839
collaborative writing. Um schools will

1433
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,000
use it to just broadcast things to

1434
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,000
students or to make students turn in

1435
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,160
their assignments with it. Um they're

1436
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,800
very unlikely to do the thing that wikis

1437
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,920
were supposed to do. um but they were

1438
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,119
more likely to fail um in title one

1439
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,880
schools and they were a little bit more

1440
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,040
likely to have some kind of student

1441
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,440
component in it in the non-por more

1442
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,960
affluent schools. Um so all of these

1443
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,480
things were free, you know, they were

1444
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,680
freely accessible on the internet, all

1445
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,480
kinds of things like that. But you could

1446
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,720
see from their like very beginning um

1447
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,920
schools that had more resources were

1448
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,119
going to be able to use them in more

1449
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,760
interesting, more student- centered

1450
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,760
kinds of ways. Um

1451
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,559
uh we'll skip that one. Oh, this is one

1452
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,400
of this is one of my sort of favorite

1453
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:22,240
pieces of research. That's an example of

1454
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,359
this. Um, so we make kids take this test

1455
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,720
that we've discussed before, the

1456
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,079
National Assessment of Education

1457
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,000
Progress. And when we make them take the

1458
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,119
test, we also make them take a survey.

1459
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,760
Um, and in 2011, uh, kids took a math

1460
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,359
test and we asked them questions like,

1461
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,800
do you use a computer for drill and

1462
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,400
practice in math? Um, do you use

1463
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,319
computers for simulations and

1464
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,920
applications? Then you can like ascribe

1465
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,400
a few things from this. We're more

1466
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,880
likely to have students do drill and

1467
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,480
practice kinds of things than we are to

1468
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,839
have them do simulations and

1469
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,960
applications and things like that. You

1470
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,960
know, I don't know, this would be like

1471
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,920
Il and this would be like geometry,

1472
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,359
sketchpad or Desmos. Um, we make black

1473
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,640
students do drill and practice things

1474
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,839
more than white students. We make poor

1475
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,359
students do drill and practice things

1476
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,839
more than non-por students. Like when we

1477
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:08,400
give people access to new technologies

1478
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:10,319
um even if they have equitable access to

1479
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,640
the technologies they often have

1480
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,000
inequitable access to different kinds of

1481
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,480
opportunities with them. So, one of the

1482
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
papers that I um assigned to you um

1483
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,000
which one of my very favorites is by a

1484
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,160
guy named Paul Atwell um called the

1485
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,559
first and second digital divide. Um and

1486
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,880
his argument is that we the digital divi

1487
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,800
divide was originally conceived as an

1488
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,400
access divide like who has computers and

1489
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,319
who doesn't, who has broadband and who

1490
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,720
doesn't. But even if you could snap your

1491
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,640
fingers and give everyone the exact same

1492
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,520
access, there would still be a digital

1493
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,800
divide of usage. There's evidence um

1494
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,240
that uh uh people from low-inccome

1495
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,240
backgrounds are more likely to use

1496
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,920
technology for drill and practice kinds

1497
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,359
of things rather than creative things

1498
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,680
and they're more likely to use it with

1499
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,960
less adult mentorship and support than

1500
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,640
more affluent folks are. Um but the

1501
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,359
funny thing when I read this 2011

1502
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,640
summary was I was like man like it was

1503
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,800
like it was like having the experience

1504
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,040
of reading a plagiarized paper. You're

1505
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,800
like I swear I've read this exact same

1506
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,440
study before. Um, uh, this is what a

1507
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,599
Apple MacBook looked like in 1996. This

1508
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,760
is what it looked like in 2011. So like

1509
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,559
like 15 years of like pretty good

1510
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,119
technological proc progress. Um, but

1511
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,160
these are the same findings from 1996.

1512
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,680
Um, and as you can see like the numbers

1513
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,119
are exactly the same. Like we asked

1514
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,400
these kids these questions 15 years

1515
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,680
apart. If you see any difference in the

1516
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,880
numbers, they're probably statistically

1517
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,200
insignificant. It's just like a little

1518
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,760
bit of variation in the um in the

1519
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,559
sampling. Um, but essentially like I

1520
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,880
mean this was like 1996 to 2011 was like

1521
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,520
a pretty big decade and a half for

1522
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,240
technology and math. Um, and we made

1523
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,680
almost no change in the fundamental ways

1524
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,200
that young people were being able to

1525
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,760
access and use technology. Does that

1526
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,640
argument make sense to you? Um, totally

1527
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,440
striking um, pair of findings there. Um,

1528
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,359
but Olrich Boser did not um, did not

1529
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,520
plagiarize from Wlinsky. They just had

1530
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,800
the the same findings. Yeah. Out of

1531
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,599
curiosity, is there a lot of difference

1532
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,440
between public public schools and like

1533
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,559
charter schools or like private schools

1534
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,480
in the US on how those

1535
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:20,319
things happen in real life? Here um I

1536
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,319
let me here's here. Yeah. Um there there

1537
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,240
are there can be like those things have

1538
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,400
enormous different gradations in the

1539
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,480
United States. Um so Dana was talking

1540
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,079
about Catholic schools in Philadelphia.

1541
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,680
those are like strictly speaking private

1542
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,599
schools, but they might be serving some

1543
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,559
of the most low-income neighborhoods and

1544
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,280
families in Philadelphia. Um, where the,

1545
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:42,079
you know, in, you know, a a a Catholic

1546
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,079
school in inner city Philadelphia might

1547
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,880
have more in common with its public

1548
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,480
neighbor than it does um, you know, to

1549
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
Sidwell Friends or something like that,

1550
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,599
a super elite private school, which

1551
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,440
might also be in Philadelphia, but might

1552
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,880
as well be in a whole different world.

1553
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:00,040
Um so so to some extent like it's sort

1554
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,359
of like tax status or organizational

1555
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:06,000
status can be related to those kinds of

1556
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,200
things but not necessarily bec you know

1557
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,280
because we have public schools that

1558
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,720
serve you know that like public school

1559
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,839
in extremely wealthy neighborhood might

1560
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,359
have more in common with a private

1561
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,920
school than it does with another public

1562
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,440
school in inner city neighborhood. Um

1563
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,359
this was kind of a cool study that was

1564
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:24,880
done um looking at three schools that

1565
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:27,280
had adopted a whole bunch of technology.

1566
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,800
Um so they like they they had roughly

1567
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,400
the same levels of access. They had

1568
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,240
bought the same kind of stuff. Um there

1569
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,680
was um they were all in the Bay Area.

1570
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,960
These aren't real names. Heathcliffe

1571
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,800
Academy which is a private mostly

1572
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,240
wealthy mostly white school. Sheldon

1573
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,920
Junior High which is a public mostly

1574
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,680
middle- class and Asian-American school.

1575
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,200
Caesar Chavez, middle school, public,

1576
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,280
mostly working-class and Latino. And

1577
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,720
again, they had all bought like roughly

1578
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,480
the same amount of stuff. Like I think

1579
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,559
like like each kid had a laptop, the

1580
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,880
laptop was connected to broadband. Um,

1581
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,760
of course, there are going to be

1582
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,119
differences, you know, some access

1583
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,799
differences in the really wealthy place

1584
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,559
and the more working-class places, but

1585
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:04,079
not but trying to find not striking

1586
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:07,040
differences. Um, but what Matt found was

1587
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,680
that the way people discussed technology

1588
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,440
was quite different. Um, so at the

1589
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,359
mostly white Heathcliffe Academy, um,

1590
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,799
uh, playing around with technology was

1591
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,160
viewed as essential. So if there were

1592
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,599
kids who were like goofing around in

1593
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,200
Minecraft and stuff like that was

1594
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,559
encouraged. Um, oh, you're playing

1595
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,200
around, you're hacking, you're doing all

1596
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,400
these kind of neat things. Um, whereas

1597
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,200
in the mostly middle class

1598
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,680
Asian-American school, like sort of

1599
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,880
goofy hacking applications of technology

1600
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,640
were considered threatening. It's like,

1601
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,119
oh, this is a risk to your education.

1602
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,680
This is a risk to your progress. Um

1603
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,040
whereas in the mostly working-class

1604
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,960
Latino school, there wasn't like

1605
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,240
encouragement or kind of discourage. It

1606
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,359
was just sort of considered irrelevant,

1607
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,640
like people weren't really paying

1608
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,799
attention to what they were doing. So

1609
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,240
again, the idea here being that like

1610
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,880
here are three institutions that had

1611
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,960
roughly similar levels of technology

1612
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,720
access, but they had like the faculty

1613
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,960
and community gave very different

1614
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,040
cultural messages about what playing

1615
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,319
around with that technology meant. Um,

1616
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,559
and for the kids who are already

1617
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,240
advantaged, they were encouraged to play

1618
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,680
and hack and goof around and things like

1619
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,200
that. But for the kids who were not

1620
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,720
already advantaged, they got different

1621
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,480
messages from their community about the

1622
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,480
values of those technology. Um,

1623
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,280
uh, and yeah, this is another sort of

1624
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,960
myth pair. The idea that technical and

1625
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,480
economic barriers are what keep people

1626
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,640
out that like if we could just get

1627
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,559
people the stuff, they would have, you

1628
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,799
know, great education with technology.

1629
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,880
whereas instead it's social and cultural

1630
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,799
exclusions which can often be the

1631
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,359
hardest. Um some of the we've talked in

1632
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:39,599
the class before about um connected

1633
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,359
learning. Um this some of these ideas

1634
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,720
about like how do kids do informal

1635
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,839
learning in their own communities and

1636
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,319
other things like that. Some of the

1637
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:48,000
things that the um that the connected

1638
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:52,240
learning researchers are most worried

1639
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,599
about right now is that like you know in

1640
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:59,680
incre as America's polarization

1641
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:03,040
um uh sort of increasingly

1642
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,599
uh is expressed on social media. Um more

1643
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,280
and more kids feel uncomfortable

1644
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,880
communicating and expressing themselves

1645
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,880
there. Um, and like white affluent dudes

1646
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,559
are the least likely to feel threatened

1647
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,839
in those spaces. And kids with all kinds

1648
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,000
of different marginalized backgrounds

1649
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:21,119
are are the ones who are more likely to

1650
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,079
withdraw from posting their fanfiction

1651
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,440
to sharing their art on Deviant Art on

1652
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,480
other kinds of things like that. Like

1653
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,960
basically what they saw was um you know

1654
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,720
in recent years ac again across all

1655
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,079
kinds of ages and racial groups and

1656
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,839
backgrounds and things like that a sort

1657
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,680
of withdrawing from public learning on

1658
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:39,520
social media but a withdrawing which

1659
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,680
seemed much more pronounced from people

1660
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,440
from marginalized backgrounds um than

1661
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,720
they did from people from more affluent

1662
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,400
backgrounds. And all of those kids have

1663
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,400
more access to technology than they've

1664
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,079
ever had before. Um but there are social

1665
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,760
and cultural exclusions that are keeping

1666
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,640
them from learning experiences in ways

1667
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,040
that are new. Um, okay. What can we do

1668
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:59,119
about this? Um, this is one of the most

1669
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,119
frustrating problems to talk about

1670
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,680
because I feel like I feel like the

1671
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,520
problem is extremely well understood.

1672
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,440
Um, this is one in which I feel like the

1673
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,520
evidence we can say for sure like if you

1674
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,280
build a new edtech thing, it is very

1675
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,680
likely to disproportionately benefit the

1676
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,200
affluent. Um, especially if you're not

1677
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,440
attentive to all to to how these issues

1678
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,040
operate. like we should not, you know,

1679
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,480
we should not assume that new generative

1680
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,319
AI tools are going to democratize

1681
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,760
education. They just are very unlikely

1682
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,799
to do that. But then you might say,

1683
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,400
well, all right, a there are some things

1684
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,240
um you read some studies of things like

1685
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,520
assistants and Carnegie learning that

1686
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,880
seem to disproportionately benefit

1687
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,200
people with low prior achievement in

1688
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,040
mathematics. Like what are they doing

1689
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,799
right? Like what are technologies that

1690
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,720
disproportionately benefit the learners

1691
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,400
who are furthest from opportunities? And

1692
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,880
I would say that we don't know very

1693
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:50,799
well. um the research on like how to fix

1694
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,200
this problem is is more novel um is more

1695
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,240
nent but here are a few things um that

1696
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,480
maybe would be promising directions to

1697
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:01,760
explore. So one think about technologies

1698
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:04,720
that align home school and community um

1699
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,559
if affluent kids automatically get kind

1700
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,079
of an educational support infrastructure

1701
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,359
from their homes and families from their

1702
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,440
college educated parents and stuff like

1703
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,839
that. How would you build technologies

1704
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,400
or technology infrastructures that like

1705
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:18,319
help all parents do more of this stuff?

1706
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,319
Um, so family creative learning is a

1707
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:22,400
super cool project by a woman named Rick

1708
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,799
Rose wrote who got a PhD here who

1709
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,040
basically was trying to figure out like

1710
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:30,880
um how would you help boys and girls

1711
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,319
clubs after schools support parents in

1712
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,920
doing a better job helping their kids

1713
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,680
use Scratch? like, "All right, so we

1714
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,359
know like we know kids of software

1715
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,799
engineers are the most likely folks to

1716
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:41,119
use Scratch, but what if we just helped

1717
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,400
all of the parents um support kids doing

1718
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,880
Scratch?" So, she would do these like

1719
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,559
multigenerational programs in after

1720
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,319
school play YMCA's, Boys and Girls

1721
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,920
Clubs, and stuff like that. You bring

1722
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,599
parents and grandparents in, you feed

1723
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,960
them dinner, you break the parents and

1724
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,640
the kids up, you each teach them

1725
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,000
something about computers, you put them

1726
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,079
back together and share their projects

1727
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,559
and stuff like that. Um, and that seemed

1728
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,599
pretty cool.

1729
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:05,920
um how do you make it so that the kinds

1730
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,200
of things that you're working on with

1731
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:12,400
technology align with young people's

1732
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,960
interests? Um so this was a a photo from

1733
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,440
a project um that was done at Georgia

1734
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,200
Tech trying to um help more

1735
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,760
African-American males in the Atlanta

1736
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,079
area get involved in computer science,

1737
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:27,520
computer programming. Um, and this was a

1738
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,640
researcher who found um that uh a lot of

1739
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,960
these kids were really interested in

1740
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,480
video games and they were interested in

1741
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,000
um the problems in the video games,

1742
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,760
bugs, glitches, and things like that.

1743
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,240
She was like, "Cool, let's make a little

1744
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,240
QA testing company." Um, and so she got

1745
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,079
a bunch of kids. She helped them um

1746
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,200
interface with companies to do QA

1747
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,960
testing. They were called the glitch

1748
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,559
game testers because the language that

1749
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,599
they used for bugs in that part of the

1750
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,359
world was glitch. Um, and as kids got

1751
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,520
more engaged in this program, she would

1752
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,960
then help them like take AP computer

1753
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,040
science and stuff like that and sort of

1754
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,280
translate into academic programming. But

1755
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,359
the idea was to like find out find out

1756
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,200
what kids entry points look like into

1757
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,280
these issues and try to build um up from

1758
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,119
there.

1759
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,319
Um, sort of similar I think to connect

1760
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,680
this is this is like the heart of

1761
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,280
connected learning like how do you

1762
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,720
connect to the interests and identities

1763
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,480
of young people? I mean, part of what

1764
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,480
Scratch was doing with Micro Worlds is

1765
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,520
being like, who is intuitively

1766
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,160
interested in creative programming, um,

1767
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,160
maybe not every kid, so, but like, what

1768
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,520
kinds of kids could we get, um, with

1769
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,799
hip-hop dance? What kinds of kids could

1770
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,720
we get with fashion? What kinds of kids

1771
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:33,040
could we get with standup comedy? Um,

1772
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,440
how could we offer a broad array of

1773
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:37,799
interests that could draw people in um,

1774
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,640
to what we're doing?

1775
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:43,079
Um, a a study that I would love to do

1776
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:47,680
one day is to think

1777
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:50,880
about how like what how do you how do ed

1778
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,640
tech companies reduce cost in ways that

1779
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,040
disproportionately benefit those who are

1780
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,400
furthest from opportunities. Um, like a

1781
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,240
funny thing to think about is like what

1782
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,400
happens when you make something free.

1783
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,920
Um, so MOOs for the most part were free.

1784
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,079
Open courseware for the most part is

1785
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,160
free. But those things probably

1786
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,440
disproportionately benefit the affluent.

1787
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,480
um like they're free things but they're

1788
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,880
better for rich people. There's actually

1789
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,280
a whole sociology of this like uh it

1790
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,480
connects to like swag bags at the Oscars

1791
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,880
and things like that. Like people are

1792
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,480
always giving rich people free stuff. Um

1793
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,160
which doesn't seem like it makes sense.

1794
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,240
Um but there are certain kinds of

1795
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:26,559
things. You know, Desmos is the bottom

1796
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:28,559
example here. Um the TI8384 was a real

1797
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,200
barrier to mathematics learning for

1798
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,559
families. Um and Desmos reduced that

1799
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,160
cost to zero. Now, a $120 calculator is

1800
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:37,440
not a huge burden for an upper class

1801
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,880
family, not a huge burden for a middle-

1802
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,359
class family. It's a big burden for a

1803
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,920
working-class family. And so, like,

1804
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,760
you're saving money for the families for

1805
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,520
whom that barrier is most relevant. Um,

1806
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,400
another one of my favorite projects, has

1807
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,799
anybody ever heard of Open Stacks? Um,

1808
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,640
they did this cool thing where they

1809
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:56,799
realized all like something like half of

1810
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,280
all higher education enrollments are in

1811
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,960
20 classes. Um, just about everybody

1812
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,880
who's taking a college class this

1813
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,079
semester across the entire United States

1814
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,000
is taking sociology 101, pre-cal,

1815
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,599
macroeconomics, micromatics, chemistry,

1816
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,760
US history, psychology, economics,

1817
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,440
algebra. Like, you know, I mean, there's

1818
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,720
a long tale of zillions and zillions of

1819
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,319
other classes that we offer in higher

1820
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,400
education, but almost everyone is in

1821
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,559
these 20 classes. They were like, let's

1822
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,720
just pay really smart people a bunch of

1823
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,280
money to write good textbooks and then

1824
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,640
give them away for free. Um, so for

1825
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,400
somebody who's coming to MIT and you're

1826
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,400
paying $50,000 a semester, whatever it

1827
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,160
is, you're paying like a $120 chemistry

1828
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,160
book is not a big deal. If you go to a

1829
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,720
community college and the entire

1830
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:39,359
chemistry course costs you $120 to

1831
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,520
register for a $120 textbook is a huge

1832
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,599
deal. It's just doubled the cost of your

1833
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,240
credit hours of education in that class.

1834
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:48,400
Um, so taking that $120 and bringing

1835
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,319
that to zero, that might really matter a

1836
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,520
lot. that could save people, you know, a

1837
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,720
meaningful amount of money that will

1838
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,079
help them advance in their community

1839
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,920
college education or other sorts of

1840
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,520
things like that. So, this idea that you

1841
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,920
could look across the education system

1842
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,079
and be like, you know, what are specific

1843
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,640
cost barriers to family that we use

1844
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,240
technology to drive down those costs in

1845
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,079
ways that like affluent people might

1846
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,920
benefit from but probably won't notice,

1847
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,200
um, but community college learners, you

1848
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,480
know, lower income working-class

1849
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,880
families might really benefit from. Um,

1850
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,160
a thing that we experimented with a lot,

1851
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,000
um, was trying to target the needs of

1852
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,520
subgroups. Um, did I talk about these

1853
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,960
experiments when we talk about MOOs? How

1854
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,039
we put all these little uh,

1855
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,520
interventions in at the beginning of MOO

1856
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,599
courses to get people to some nodding

1857
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,119
heads? It's in the books there. Um, we

1858
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,119
designed a whole series of interventions

1859
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,799
that were trying to increase the sense

1860
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,240
of belonging or increase the sense of

1861
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,319
well-being from people who might

1862
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:43,599
perceive themselves being from minority

1863
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:45,200
backgrounds. Um, and we thought they

1864
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,880
worked for a while and then we weren't

1865
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,000
sure that that our interventions was

1866
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,079
working. But it's sort of an interesting

1867
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,359
things to think about like what kind of,

1868
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,720
you know, if you if you're trying to

1869
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,480
serve people from a wide range of

1870
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,920
backgrounds and you know that some

1871
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,359
people from those backgrounds might not

1872
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,039
have the same level of support at home

1873
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:00,559
or might not have the same, you know,

1874
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,599
might experience stereotype threat or

1875
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,200
other kinds of things like that, like

1876
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:08,000
what kinds of interventions could you

1877
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:10,799
design to to address those needs? Um

1878
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,760
uh another thing to think about is like

1879
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:15,920
where could you target supports sort of

1880
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,520
across someone's educational trajectory.

1881
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,720
This is another sort of sad story of

1882
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,559
things that we thought worked for a

1883
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,839
little while and probably don't but

1884
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,359
still the problem is real. Um Ben Castle

1885
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:27,760
Ben Castleman worked at this school in

1886
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:29,119
in Providence called MET. Um and they

1887
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,480
were a charter school and they did a

1888
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,920
pretty good job getting kids into

1889
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,240
college. But one of the things they

1890
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,119
observed which totally broke their heart

1891
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,960
is that they would get kids into college

1892
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,400
accepted to college and then they

1893
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,760
wouldn't show up in the fall. Um like

1894
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,440
like you like like you're in part of you

1895
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,480
know four year 12ear educational system

1896
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,480
which is trying to get kids into

1897
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,480
post-secary education and you succeed.

1898
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,079
They have an application letter and some

1899
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,680
fraction of them don't arrive in the

1900
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,640
fall. They ended up calling that summer

1901
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:58,640
melt. um is the uh you know and part of

1902
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,480
it is if you are the first person in

1903
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,319
your family to go to college then

1904
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,760
figuring out FAFSA, figuring out course

1905
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,760
enrollment, figuring out moving on

1906
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,280
campus like if you come from a family

1907
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,720
where you're not first generation like

1908
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,920
your mom and your dad just explain all

1909
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,240
that stuff to you and figure it out and

1910
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,680
you get through it. Um but each of those

1911
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,440
obstacles, you know, and there are a few

1912
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,680
of them to showing up at Campson's each

1913
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,680
of those was enough. Um, so they

1914
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,079
designed these technologies that

1915
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,319
basically like sent little text message

1916
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,319
nudges to kids all throughout the

1917
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,920
summer, you know, have you figured out

1918
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:29,359
your financial aid? Have you registered?

1919
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,440
Have you other kinds of things like

1920
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,200
that? Um, and for a little while it

1921
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,960
looked like those nudges were working

1922
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,039
and then people reproduced at larger

1923
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,720
scales and this particular intervention

1924
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,520
doesn't seem like it's it's actually

1925
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,760
working. Um but it was at least this

1926
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,119
sort of good idea of being like let's

1927
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,960
think about people's educational

1928
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,240
trajectory from you know for all the

1929
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,520
transition points you have between

1930
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,960
middle school and high school and

1931
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,640
college and post-secary and lifelong

1932
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,160
learning and things like that and where

1933
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,920
might there might be transition points

1934
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,839
that affluent folks just kind of breeze

1935
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,520
through um but folks from working-class

1936
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:03,920
families find more struggles with um and

1937
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:07,440
pro probably the biggest challenge that

1938
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,760
education technology has um is things

1939
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,559
that really work in education often are

1940
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,319
tailored to their particular context.

1941
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,400
But usually what software developers are

1942
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:18,319
trying to do is build a thing that works

1943
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,799
anywhere. I mean that's that's a real

1944
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,480
tension. That's a real problem. Um there

1945
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,000
are some cool examples of this. You know

1946
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,000
I think you you could think of like the

1947
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,400
open edex platform is something kind of

1948
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,839
working on that. So like there's one big

1949
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,759
software platform and there are a couple

1950
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,120
of you know there's like edex as a big

1951
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,239
organization that offers mukes

1952
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:39,040
everywhere but there are dozens of local

1953
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:40,719
sort of MOO operators that offer in

1954
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,799
their particular country in their

1955
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:45,000
particular language in topics that they

1956
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:47,839
think local folks will be interested in.

1957
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,880
Um, one of them is Edrok, which is run

1958
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:53,359
by the Queen Rana Foundation. Um, which,

1959
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,520
uh, focuses on offering Arabic language

1960
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,120
classes to folks in Jordan and areas

1961
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,960
surrounding Jordan. And you could just

1962
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,560
imagine, well, okay, like, so they can

1963
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,239
take edex, they can make sure it

1964
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,319
supports right to left reading in

1965
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,520
Arabic, they can um, you know, do

1966
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,199
whatever else you need to make the

1967
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,880
Arabic interface work better, offer

1968
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,480
courses in Arabic, find out what the

1969
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,120
people in the Arabic world would want to

1970
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,440
be able to do. um and they're using the

1971
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,799
same kind of base software as everyone

1972
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,679
else, but that software is kind of

1973
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:22,920
customizable to serve particular um

1974
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,600
notions and areas.

1975
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:28,400
Um and and the idea is you might be able

1976
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:32,080
to apply all of these different kinds of

1977
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:34,719
thinking um all across a project's life

1978
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:37,839
cycle. Um so as we were giving these

1979
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,920
talks to people who fund technologies to

1980
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:42,080
venture capitalists to philanthropists

1981
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,000
to technologies developers to like you

1982
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,520
know the big fang kind of companies that

1983
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,960
have publishers who have a bunch of

1984
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,880
things underneath them who are saying

1985
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,400
like you know what are all the

1986
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,320
strategies you might try when you're

1987
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:56,480
funding a company um to get uh um to get

1988
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,400
the right people at the table. You know,

1989
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,719
lots of times when we when we fund

1990
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,719
education technologies, the only people

1991
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,159
who make those choices are like affluent

1992
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,360
people who went to private school and

1993
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,480
stuff like that. Like how would you make

1994
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,560
more people from more diverse

1995
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,159
backgrounds to be able to do that and so

1996
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,800
forth and so on through all of the

1997
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:15,360
different um uh programs. So in some

1998
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,640
ways it's sort of uh disappointing that

1999
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,760
there aren't better answers. Like it

2000
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,440
would be nice to give a lecture like

2001
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,000
this and be like we totally know what to

2002
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,760
do to make education more equitable. Um

2003
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,920
but we don't have that. But we have some

2004
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,520
really clear I mean in my mind just

2005
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,199
definitive evidence that when people

2006
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,520
build education technologies if they

2007
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,960
don't center the needs of marginalized

2008
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,640
communities it will disproportionately

2009
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,400
benefit the affluent like you can you

2010
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,840
can pretty much guarantee that as an

2011
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,080
outcome for almost anything that comes

2012
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,440
along. Um and there's lots of

2013
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,440
interesting work to be done and things

2014
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,040
to explore to figure out like how could

2015
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,640
we learn more about being more

2016
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,080
intentional about building things that

2017
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:53,120
serve a diverse range of folks. Um and

2018
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,640
then I so I won't see you I will see you

2019
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,239
each individually next week to talk

2020
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,000
about your projects. Um and then the

2021
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:01,440
following week we'll talk about the next

2022
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,760
couple of um uh as yet intractable

2023
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,679
dilemmas um the trap of routine

2024
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,600
assessment and the toxic power of data

2025
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,120
and experiments. So very nice to see you

2026
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,120
this week and I look forward to seeing

2027
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:17,080
you um individually next week and enjoy

2028
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,080
your long weekend.
