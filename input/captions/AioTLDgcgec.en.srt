1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,679
First of all, thank you for having us

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,480
all here today. Um, this is fantastic.

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,200
It's an awesome opportunity. Um, anybody

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,359
want to guess how you pronounce our logo

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,359
or our company? Visible. Visible. There

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,240
you go. Awesome. Love it. Um, speaking

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
about visibility, um, who would guess

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,960
how many engineering leaders actually

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,960
know how to measure their organizations?

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
Yeah, that's a tough one. My name is

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,600
Chad Upton. I'm a co-founder of Visible.

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm the COO. And um I'm really excited

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,640
to share that we have built a platform

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,160
that helps engineering leaders shine a

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,879
light on what's actually happening in

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,879
their engineering

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,480
organizations. Um the truth is we're

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
absolutely drowning in disconnected

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
tools. We have all of our AI agents now.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,160
We have all the SDLC's. We have DevOps.

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
We have everything that's out there

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,479
everywhere. And uh we have cheer for

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
tickets, Slack for comms, um what else

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,200
we got? GitHub for code, those kind of

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,080
things, right? And so hours vanish just

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,360
trying to answer status updates. If you

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
look at how many requests, how many

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
Slack messages you get? Hey, when was

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,320
that last release? When was that last

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,000
P1? All of those kinds of things. You're

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,159
constantly looking at where do I go to

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
find this information? And now we have

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,520
AI. Are we using it enough? Is it being

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,119
adopted? Can we measure the impact?

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,880
These are all areas in which Visible is

36
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,000
focusing. But honestly, it's crazy that

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,159
we're in 2025, and we still don't have

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,920
this problem

39
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,759
solved. Um, projects stall, teams fall

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,560
behind, and millions of dollars vanish,

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,720
and refactors and

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,880
delays. 71% of IT projects fail. 50% of

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,439
those are because of fail of poor

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,439
execution.

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,680
The result, I think most of us know this

46
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,479
answer, wasted budgets, crushed morale,

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,479
and missed market

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,360
opportunities. Um, so why hasn't it been

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,959
solved? Well, most of the other teams

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
out there and competitors that we are

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,400
going against, um, they're really,

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,560
really focused on collecting your data

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
from all of these tools. That has been

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,640
the theme for the last 2, three, four

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:32,000
years. Um, Visible instead has been

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,440
laser focused on connecting your data.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,360
We built an ontology model that weaves

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,160
all of your data into a single knowledge

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,599
graph. This helps us connect the why to

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,720
the how across all your tools. Once we

61
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,879
do that, we use the power of LLM to

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,480
translate natural language questions

63
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,319
into queries and then we enrich the

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,000
responses giving you clear insights on

65
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,000
what is actually happening inside your

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,519
organization. But as we've all talked

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,080
about today, we're all focused on saving

68
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,760
time, that endless parade of status

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,400
updates. Why did we what did we really

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,200
release? you know, um, are we tracking

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,239
on track for Q2? We spend countless

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,840
hours every week just responding. And

73
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
don't even get me started on how many

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,000
other people I have to bother to answer

75
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,560
some of these questions, right? I have

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,879
to go to other engineering meeters, QA,

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,760
other teams, those kinds of things. So,

78
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,959
it's not just

79
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,879
us. And unlike some of the other ones

80
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
that are here that are um much further

81
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
in their journey, we're very early.

82
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
We've spent countless nights and

83
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
weekends um building this product and

84
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
we're actually starting to see real real

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,640
traction in the market. Um we started

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,799
working with Matt at Defiance AI and he

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,440
is a basically a consulting type firm of

88
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,200
what they do there and we've unlocked

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,720
data connecting all his tools together

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,560
that he's now able to get rid of

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,599
spreadsheets and manual data crunching

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,120
saving hours every week. Um I think it

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,439
translated to something like six hours

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,439
per manager.

95
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,879
So, for a company company that's called

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,079
Visible, um, why haven't you heard about

97
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,880
us? Because we've been pretty invisible,

98
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,960
unfortunately, which is kind of ironic.

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,800
Um, we did the really hard part first.

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
We wanted to build a product we knew we

101
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,320
would actually use. My entire founding

102
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,600
team are almost all product and

103
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,800
engineering. We know this space very,

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,560
very well. Um, now we're ready to focus

105
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,560
on our go to market. So, that's kind of

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,320
why we're here talking to everyone else.

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
Um, we're expanding and we're looking to

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,440
bring 50 to 100 pilots over the next 12

109
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,880
months. We want organizations that crave

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,800
real time analytics, operational

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,919
narratives, and a clear competitive

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,919
advantage in software

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,360
engineering. And so, right now,

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,440
engineering is at a very critical point.

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,919
AI is disrupting almost every single

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,320
vertical we have out there. Teams

117
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,560
without deep operation visibility are

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,160
left to

119
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,199
guess and those with it are going to

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,280
start pulling ahead. We built visible so

121
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,520
you're not left

122
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,520
behind. Thank you.

123
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,240
Thank you Todd. Any questions there?

124
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,320
So, I'm not quite clear when you say

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,199
metrics, are we talking about like stuff

126
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,000
like cycle time

127
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,160
and all like um velocity and all that?

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,720
Those are the um it's so funny you say

129
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,560
those. That's what the industry has been

130
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,440
using to measure our teams. Dorometrics

131
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,039
is kind of like our baseline today. And

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
if you ask anybody today, what do you

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,800
use Dorometrics to actually measure or

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
have you actually done anything with

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,919
those that's actionable? The answer is

136
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,560
probably no. So um instead what we've

137
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,199
done is connecting to all these tools.

138
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,039
We pull every single event that happens

139
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
either web hooks, your GitHubs, your

140
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,319
selects, every comment, every commit

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
message, everything that you do across

142
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,919
all these and then we combine them in

143
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,880
that model. So then you have a interface

144
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,960
to query to ask anything you want. But

145
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
we've built simple use cases for you to

146
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,080
say what were our key deliverables for

147
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,680
this team for the last 30 days and it

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
gives you a chat GPT type narrative that

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
go that comes out and gives you

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
everything that you need to know so

151
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,600
you're not having to be a data scientist

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,479
to understand the metrics you're looking

153
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,479
at. Great question. Anyone else? Yes

154
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,240
sir.

155
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,840
One other

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
very simple one. I'm assuming your

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,000
system requires a cloud connection,

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,960
right? It does. Yes. Um assuming most of

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
your tools are in a I mean today it

160
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,440
does. It probably wouldn't doesn't have

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,600
to necessarily. Um if your code is

162
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,440
stored in a local private GitHub repo,

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,039
for an example, we could probably get to

164
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,400
it.

165
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't need any

166
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,960
AI. Okay. It could it could be hosted on

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,840
premise completely.

168
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,319
Um, yes it could be. We could deploy it

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,039
anywhere if we had

170
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,560
to. Great question. Thank you, Chad.

171
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
We'll um move on to the next startup,

172
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,800
but of course you can thank you very

173
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,800
much. Further with all of them.
