1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,960
today um going be a little bit boring

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,000
for people on the on watching later and

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,400
stuff because we're going to mostly um

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,600
be flipping things around so we're going

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,720
to use this time for quite a lot of

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,119
inclass

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,679
work um and you might need the chair

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,640
there and um try to get things um uh

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,320
getting ready for later and having

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,399
videos online um for some of the new

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,200
topics that are coming

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,320
up um before we get to to this is the

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,039
fifth week of the semester um first are

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,079
there any questions so far on problem

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,359
set

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,760
four Adam so optic you would want to two

17
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:01,879
list at the

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,879
same um let me see would I want

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,920
they no not necessarily what's what's a

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,920
part what let's let's think through

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,439
again optic O is just out it out octave

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,640
p

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:21,400
t transposition good I inversion and

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,159
C one of those um is very important that

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,720
you test well all of them is important

26
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,920
that you test with uh different length

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,400
sets but what's one of the ones that

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,759
might um might sometimes return uh true

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,720
if if the two um that the two pitch sets

30
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,320
are equivalent if you have this

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,240
equivalence

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,079
class cality cardinality yeah so

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,000
cardinality equivalence I it's kind of a

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,759
odd thing isn't it because it's not it's

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,399
kind of the backwards one is isn't it it

36
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,399
should be like

37
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,560
oped um duplication or something because

38
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,360
is specifically not saying that things

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,200
are equivalent if their cardinality is

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,799
the same it is saying two things are

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,000
equivalent if you if their what do you

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,480
want to I suppose cardinality is is that

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,160
if duplicates are removed um good so so

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,239
yeah there will be cases where um where

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,760
two pit sets will have different lengths

46
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,360
and um and of of things and be

47
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,480
equivalent

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,480
um uh oh one important thing uh um I'll

49
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll do the one that I forgot to do um

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
that's on

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,920
inversion and

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,360
inversion

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,959
is one of these things probably like

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,400
mode or something like that that we used

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,519
way too often in music to mean too many

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,680
related but different things so I'm just

57
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,640
going to move that more to the center

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,440
um so what the two places that we've

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,280
been talking about inversion

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,599
are in sort of this

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,720
um do you remember this circle from C C

62
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,640
sharp d flat if spelling doesn't matter

63
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:19,000
D am I getting there about right yep E

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,319
flat E F now somehow I've well because

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,200
my circle is more of an egg um you know

66
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:29,280
so on and sorry I'm uh blanking

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
on it's been a long time since I've

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,400
written a circle of notes that is not

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,239
the circle of fifths on the board right

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,519
okay got that in order and we've thought

71
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,319
about this sort of axis of inversion

72
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,080
that you can have do you remember that

73
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,920
um that can Define um ways that pitches

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,480
can invert to each other we also use

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,879
inversion and so this is prime the

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,560
primary one that deit tachko is talking

77
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,239
about we also use inversion to mean sign

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,120
we called tonal inversion

79
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,680
which is to say oh yeah we did this in

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,640
class for a second right that this can

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,879
be

82
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,879
inverted to

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,680
be

84
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,280
this even though so because here we go

85
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,160
up a step here we go down a step here we

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,320
go up another step we go down a step up

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,720
a step down a step but even though the

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,000
steps are different sizes right so F to

89
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:36,240
G is what kind of Step whole step next

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,039
one whole step half and this one half

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,320
whole whole so but so in the in the

92
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,560
strictly

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,080
enharmonic context of inversion they

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,919
would not be the same which is the

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,400
context that Demitri Tranco is mostly

96
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,720
talking about in the tonal context they

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,320
would um they would be the same though

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,639
right but then there's this third part

99
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,720
this third very common use of the word

100
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,479
inversion in music that is not what

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,280
we're talking about in any way on this

102
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,360
problem set when John you know what that

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,840
is Chord inv chord inversion chord

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,120
inversion so right so if I have a chord

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,120
let's say a

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,479
major what is the base if I am in second

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,880
inversion e great

108
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
so you might have something like

109
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,600
that now here's so that's the

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,280
explanation part that's the

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,560
clarification part and now the the

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,720
critical thinking thing chord inversion

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,080
in this sense has to do with what letter

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,080
of

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,360
optic

116
00:05:51,919 --> 00:06:01,600
p and there's another one so P we could

117
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:04,840
say that a c Shar e is the same as e e c

118
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,240
a but there's something else we need

119
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,400
yeah oh so we need that this o is

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,199
equivalent to this o that this octave is

121
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,080
the same as this octave I see everybody

122
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,960
shivering it's really cold in here today

123
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,039
isn't it right okay no I maybe it's just

124
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,199
me you're cold other people are cold and

125
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm like up here here okay so o

126
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,599
and octave and

127
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,319
permutation um

128
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,080
if you have an augmented Triad there's

129
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,199
an interesting here let's just keep

130
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,440
playing we'll make a simpler augmented

131
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,960
Triad that you might have thought of

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,520
before then the different inversions

133
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,919
have to do with you can think of them as

134
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,639
o and P but specifically for the

135
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:55,599
augmented Triad there's another um

136
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,599
letter that comes into play

137
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,560
let's get the sound of the augmented

138
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,319
Triad into our

139
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,479
[Music]

140
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,840
ears what's a way that we can do let's

141
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,680
say a first

142
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,680
inversion of

143
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,560
this augmented

144
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,639
Triad yeah uh actually no just calling

145
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,080
out somebody go uh I I let's see yes

146
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,440
because we can

147
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,479
invert around this this point and what

148
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,160
are the two intervals from here to here

149
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:40,520
the same they the they are the same um

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:45,120
uh yes but what what are

151
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,400
they go major major third

152
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,360
and and major third because you already

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,080
said the same good sorry sometimes I I

154
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,639
for I forget that was prefaced with

155
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,240
something that we that required me to

156
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,080
use the C operator to um to map major

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,759
third to Major third major third right

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
good so it can be inversion there's

159
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,159
another way you can think of it yeah

160
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,759
Jason position transposition so if we go

161
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,879
up what do we have to go up a major

162
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,680
third so C goes up to e e goes up a

163
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,520
major third

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,319
to um

165
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,400
to g d g sharp and then G Shar goes up a

166
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,720
major third

167
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,399
to C C first it goes up a major third to

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,959
B

169
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,919
sharp and then what other operate what

170
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:41,159
other letter are we thinking of s s

171
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:45,160
spelling so that the the uh what do you

172
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,959
call it the E BP goes to C natural you

173
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,399
can think of all of these different

174
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,080
letters and different equivalence

175
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,880
classes as quite often depending on your

176
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,519
context different ways of getting to the

177
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,600
same answer um the hard part on the

178
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,320
problem set though is sometimes figuring

179
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,040
out if you're giv given multiple um if

180
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,560
you're given multiple of these letters

181
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:13,040
together you're saying that you have the

182
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:15,000
um o and P set um can you apply o and

183
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,519
then p and is that the same as applying

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,120
p and then

185
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,079
o sometimes it will be sometimes it or

186
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,680
some of these combinations of letters

187
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:28,120
the order won't matter and some of the

188
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,000
combinations of letters will open up new

189
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,720
possibilities that

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,720
chaining one and then the other will um

191
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,720
will not be sufficient for

192
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,600
anybody far enough on the pet to

193
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,600
encounter any of

194
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
those some of you have some people have

195
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,079
turned them

196
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,560
in do you remember any of the ones that

197
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:59,680
were like that

198
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:02,959
um like years ago um yeah I think

199
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,079
like octave permutation didn't matter

200
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,560
octave and permutation didn't matter

201
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:12,560
which one you did I think

202
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,560
that's I think that's correct yeah yep

203
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,720
see I I I should be thinking there's how

204
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,440
many combinations of there's what do you

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,640
what do you call it there's uh n Cho

206
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,800
five choose two right there's or five

207
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,640
factorial combinations but um or just

208
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,399
two no two to the 5ifth combinations uh

209
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,680
with optic but um some of a lot of them

210
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,639
them are never used you would never use

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,160
I don't know

212
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,279
um card what's something you wouldn't

213
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,120
use inversion without permutation quite

214
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,800
often or something like that yeah great

215
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,959
or inversion and permutation without

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,440
octave equivalence or something

217
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,480
fantastic I want to introduce you to um

218
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,760
another friend we're going to have more

219
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,680
as class goes on these little uh one to

220
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,040
two minute guest speakers and here is

221
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,839
somebody who

222
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,839
uh went through this class like

223
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:13,279
you hi I'm Sophia and I work with Mike

224
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,959
with music 21 in like 2016 2017 we wrote

225
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,959
this paper called emotion

226
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,079
planning called emotion painting lyric

227
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,800
affect musical relationship in a large

228
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,320
scale Lei Corpus and then idea is

229
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,360
there's this concept called word

230
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,360
painting in classical music where the

231
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,800
music sort of reflects what the lyrics

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,519
says so rise you will sing like rise or

233
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,920
fall you will sing fall and then we want

234
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,920
to see how prevalent that is in say folk

235
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,959
or popular music we had this Corpus of

236
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,000
around 1900 songs of folk music or

237
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,279
popular music and then we're able to

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,639
analyze it with music 21 what we did is

239
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,839
we used the natural language toolkit and

240
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
analyzed the emotion conveyed by the

241
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,639
lyrics and then looked at the

242
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,120
corresponding notes in the music um we

243
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,200
found a bunch of interesting things like

244
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,920
more emotive words that convey an

245
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,200
emotion are more likely to fall on

246
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,880
strong beat strengths like the first

247
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,240
beat or like the third beat on beat

248
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,160
whereas uh words that doesn't convey of

249
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,399
emotion like is and um will fall on

250
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,560
weaker beat strengthes and also

251
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,079
interesting things like words with

252
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,560
strong negative emotions like anger

253
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,399
disgust or fear tend to fall on shorter

254
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,120
notes

255
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,120
and that's what we

256
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,800
did so we're going to be moving on to

257
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,920
the concept of um Corpus and corpora um

258
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,560
it's a little bit and so what do we do

259
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,199
and statistics because the only reason

260
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,639
to look at a huge number of pieces is to

261
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:54,519
come up with some kind of statistical um

262
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,000
sort of summary or extraction or to find

263
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,720
things that are outliers within it and

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,440
even if you're thinking you know oh yeah

265
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,600
or to do deep learning stuff and you

266
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,959
those who have taken artificial

267
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,199
intelligence and deep learning classes

268
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,079
you'll know that um at its heart these

269
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,880
are all just statistics right this is

270
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,120
all just a whole bunch of numbers that

271
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,000
are being trained and extracted from

272
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,720
things um the Corpus I was hoping for us

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,440
to work with today I haven't been able

274
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,079
to get it working well enough to not

275
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,560
crash and um on my system and that's my

276
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,079
U my bad for uh not having this up um um

277
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,519
but I want to point out to you we're

278
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:37,880
going to be talking about uh more it's a

279
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,800
collection of um I think uh

280
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,079
2000 um

281
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,680
encoded uh leads a art song songs that

282
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:51,639
are sung in concerts and things

283
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,560
primarily by um women and uh and and

284
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,480
black and other minority composers um

285
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,399
you'll see that there are some people in

286
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,440
here beIN who are don't fit in any of

287
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,399
those categories and that was in order

288
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,759
to have a comparison set in there

289
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,720
um I don't know I'll have to ask Mark

290
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,160
Gotham the great researcher who was

291
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,440
doing this I think also he had really

292
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,320
hoped to get 2,000 and had a certain day

293
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
and found that he already had some bin

294
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,639
lying around or something but it's a

295
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,279
really amazing uh Corpus and I hope that

296
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,199
we're going to be able to work with it

297
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,639
later in uh the year um today being

298
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:28,360
International women's day I thought that

299
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,720
would be a particularly good day to work

300
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,880
with it but last things don't often hit

301
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,680
um our deadlines and we can uh we can

302
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,720
jump back to that

303
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,720
later

304
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,079
uh the second one that we're going to be

305
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,120
working with and the reason why you have

306
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,560
your laptops out today uh that we're

307
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,920
going to be working with together in

308
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,360
class is um part of this uh Essen folk

309
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,279
um music data set um and it's we're

310
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,839
going to be looking at the an Irish folk

311
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,440
music Corpus uh there's a lot of Irish

312
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,600
FK folk music corpora online and we'll

313
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,560
be uh looking at that then just to sum

314
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,519
up then we'll be looking at probably the

315
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,000
most overlooked at Corpus of all time um

316
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,000
but the one that's um there's a lot of

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,639
written about it and that is Johan

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,920
Sebastian box uh Corrals um the ones

319
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,320
that you've already been working with a

320
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,040
couple of them we're going to see what

321
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,639
happens when we work with all of them

322
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,240
one of the things I'm going to be asking

323
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,560
you to look at is one uh over the next

324
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,279
by next class if you can um is to start

325
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,839
reading an article um by Brett Arden and

326
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,800
David hon uh which is as you can kind of

327
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,800
see from the uh from the quality of the

328
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,079
of the scans a little bit of an old

329
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
article I think it's about 20 years old

330
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,959
now but it was one of the first ones to

331
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,959
see what happens when you take musical

332
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,199
features and compare them to geographic

333
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,959
features so like looking at um a density

334
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,360
contour map of melodies wherea most

335
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,279
phrases end on the tonic we can see that

336
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,639
there's a huge change from here to here

337
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,880
in that's Denmark up here this is

338
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:13,680
Germany uh right where the Alps began

339
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,319
and so we can see how um how geographic

340
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,600
features might change um yeah might

341
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,240
might change how how music goes so um

342
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,399
I'm going to blank that for a second I'm

343
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,920
going to open up a Jupiter notebook and

344
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,880
we're also going to unlock a few things

345
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,839
along the way so so hoping that we'll um

346
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,560
get through some of these music 21

347
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,240
topics as we as we

348
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,519
go

349
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,880
so we'll start by um importing an artic

350
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,920
of something that we've already unlocked

351
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,839
from music 21 import

352
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:56,079
Corpus and we'll call IRL abbreviation

353
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:59,680
for Ireland Corpus parse um we'll be

354
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:03,399
safe SN Essen f

355
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,600
song SL IRL see how close I can get this

356
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,600
to me so I'm still looking at you

357
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,079
oops

358
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,199
this topic five

359
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,360
2023

360
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:22,559
great so everybody give me a quick

361
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,559
thumbs up if we're at this place awesome

362
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,559
super

363
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,240
um okay um

364
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,160
one of the things you can do anything

365
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,960
that you get from the Corpus just in

366
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:42,200
case you ever need to um look at it oops

367
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:47,120
sorry have an old thing um is look at

368
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,480
where it is in um on your hard

369
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,640
drive okay now somebody can hack my hard

370
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,880
drive um and um and so on U what kind of

371
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,240
thing would you expect IRL to be what

372
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
kind of object

373
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,799
an INT who votes for INT no

374
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,799
float

375
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,600
string want to take

376
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,520
a you think it's string no you don't

377
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,640
think what what what usually are we

378
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,640
working with in music

379
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,760
21 stream great well kind of a stream do

380
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,840
we think is score score score would be

381
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,520
most logical right in this case we're

382
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,880
working this is our first time working

383
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,240
with something bigger than a score uh

384
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,600
something called an opus so a collection

385
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,280
of scores and so um what we can do is we

386
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,280
can look

387
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,919
at at how many scores are in here so

388
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,600
this is a pretty small Corpus but big

389
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,240
enough to start doing some um statistics

390
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,679
on so we can do

391
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,080
like IRL

392
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,080
docor z.

393
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
show

394
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,280
and good deterministic it's still the

395
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,080
same one that I thought it would be um

396
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,960
and see this one of the things you'll

397
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,520
find if you're really interested in um

398
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,520
in being efficient is instead of doing

399
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:33,000
um inte into z uh what do you call it

400
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,360
square bracket zero and most on music 21

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,679
scores once you've done all your fil uh

402
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,960
streams once you've done all your

403
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:44,600
filtering you can do first and last and

404
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:47,320
all they are is um o of one um or that

405
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,960
that they stop finding all the scores

406
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,240
once they found the first one so it's a

407
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,760
little bit if you're into um algorithmic

408
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,760
optimization it can sometimes be quite a

409
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,960
bit faster for very long notes Okay so

410
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,480
what I want to know is

411
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,240
um this is interesting it's in 3 four um

412
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,440
pick

413
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,799
up good it does some of the things that

414
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:18,480
we expect um uh tunel pieces from folk

415
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:22,840
era to do if you begin with um what is

416
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,840
it a dotted eighth a dotted quarter um

417
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,000
missing at the beginning or added to the

418
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,400
pickup measure at the beginning you

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,840
expect that at the very end you also

420
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,520
have that so that the pickup measure and

421
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,600
the ending measure um usually represent

422
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,640
one oh is everything okay yeah go ahead

423
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,480
you sure of course always glad

424
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,320
to

425
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,840
so do we get it that yeah the piece

426
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,760
looks a little bit different the piece

427
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,720
looks a little bit different on yours

428
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,600
um hugely terribly different like

429
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,679
now just just a little little bit

430
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,039
different okay

431
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,200
um yeah it's I mean depending on your

432
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,480
version uh here's here's what it looked

433
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,279
like a couple years ago so it's quite a

434
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,679
bit smaller back then and things but

435
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,000
okay um

436
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:26,480
so it's in

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,480
34 is that common for Irish folk

438
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,520
music what would you what do you think

439
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,279
who has who has heard Irish musicians

440
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,679
play in their life for Irish music not

441
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,919
very many uh keep your hand up if you're

442
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,279
also over 21 no just kidding um because

443
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,320
they do usually play uh one of the

444
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,279
places you can hear quite often uh Irish

445
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,640
folk musicians play in Boston is in pubs

446
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,120
and things but um so rest so of people

447
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,600
who have heard or people who think they

448
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,320
might know this or um what's what's a a

449
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,200
time signature that you think would be

450
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:07,919
common Adam two four two4 shy 68 68 John

451
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,279
68 Al or I was going to say 68 68 well

452
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,960
one of this is one of those cool

453
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,240
questions where where if you have the

454
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,320
same answer as somebody else who still

455
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,000
want to hear because that starts

456
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,480
building up consensus somebody give me a

457
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,840
time signature you you don't expect to

458
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:25,400
be the highest uh the most commonly used

459
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,520
time signature yeah Jason 74 74 good

460
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,480
good okay so we have some

461
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,919
hypothesis what we're going to do is try

462
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,679
to figure out what's the most commonly

463
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,520
used time signature uh in this Irish

464
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,120
folk thing and always start with a

465
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,200
hypothesis because the number of times

466
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,679
I've seen people go ahead and um publish

467
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,600
things that don't um where they don't

468
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,159
have a a hypothesis and then they don't

469
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,039
realize like oh uh I printed out the

470
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,360
measure number divided by the number of

471
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:58,200
notes not uh you know not the time

472
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,279
signature um and therefore you know 137

473
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,200
over 14,000 probably wasn't the most

474
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,279
common time signature so let's start um

475
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,919
this was a question that came up at some

476
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:12,440
point um uh can you use are anything in

477
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,559
the normal python Library unlocked in

478
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,000
this class yes so let's import the

479
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,600
counter who's has who's seen counter not

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,320
everybody okay some people some people

481
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,400
haven't counter is just it's a very cool

482
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,240
um little it's just a dictionary but um

483
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,360
it starts off at zero when something's

484
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,720
not there so you don't have to say uh

485
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,200
when you're adding things up you can

486
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,400
just uh you start from from that so you

487
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,799
can you can you can just start adding

488
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,880
one to things um so I kind of like that

489
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:49,440
so let say for song in the Irish

490
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:52,159
Corpus um we can do we're going want to

491
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,159
get the time signature so I want you to

492
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,159
song.

493
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,640
something oops pull that up a little bit

494
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,880
and fill out the rest or maybe song

495
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,120
Maybe we don't even need to dot

496
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,960
something I don't know song is probably

497
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,960
the next

498
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,400
thing and you we did put um IRL scores

499
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,720
first up there so you know you can test

500
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
this on

501
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,440
one let's let's say we're only get for

502
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,200
Simplicity sake we're only going to be

503
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,600
counting the first time signature in

504
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,080
each song and um

505
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,679
and that most of the songs in this

506
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,760
collection I think all of them are

507
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
monophonic so uh you're only going to

508
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,799
have one

509
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,080
part where are some words you're

510
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:44,120
typing um get element by class good get

511
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,039
element by class or get uh there's one

512
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,360
one little typle get

513
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,640
elements plural yeah so unfortunately

514
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:56,679
there isn't a get first element thing

515
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,880
great anybody else having other words

516
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,679
that you're typing that you'd like

517
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,679
everyone else to

518
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,399
know you're all unless I tell you

519
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,720
otherwise like the midterm or something

520
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,679
you're generally allowed to talk to

521
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,679
people around

522
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,320
you Joe what's word that you've typed um

523
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:38,600
just okay

524
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,080
cool yeah what's um I guess we can like

525
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,880
yeah use

526
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,039
meter. okay meter. typ yeah so you'll

527
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,760
probably want to import meter sorry uh

528
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,679
if I didn't do that you can import

529
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,679
anything that's unlocked always so from

530
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,120
music 21 import meter and what's the

531
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,720
word that you said

532
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,240
meter dot time signature that that one

533
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,240
might be helpful

534
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,919
anybody else have any words that you've

535
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:08,919
been

536
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:16,520
typing fine I'm I'm going to type a

537
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,880
Word my word is recurse anybody type

538
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,440
that

539
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,880
word

540
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:27,679
no or

541
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,679
flatten anybody type that word

542
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,799
I'm I'm only asking for this this line

543
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,480
so go I'm I'm just trying to figure out

544
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,320
has who has gotten a time signature out

545
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,559
okay so some some people have uh Vincent

546
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:52,440
what you what' you type to get your time

547
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,440
suggestion so recurse El okay good

548
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,799
recurse do get Elements by

549
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,159
class and

550
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,080
anybody help what's the next thing I'm

551
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,240
going to

552
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,640
type meter. time

553
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,279
signature great

554
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,600
um anything else that I should be typing

555
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,600
on

556
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:21,960
that is that is this correct will TS now

557
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,960
be a meter. time

558
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,039
signature okay let's let's try let's try

559
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,320
this on one song since I don't know if

560
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,559
we have this at all so we'll call we'll

561
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,520
go back to the IRL do scores. first and

562
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:40,080
um what do we what was that name of that

563
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:44,440
song A lady Fair we'll call it lady um

564
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,760
equals IRL s scores at first um now

565
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:53,720
we'll try this lady. recurse doget

566
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,720
Elements by class meter. time

567
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,519
signature who votes this is going to get

568
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,159
me a time signature

569
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,440
who votes

570
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,960
not okay not sure not sure but not a

571
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,880
time signature you had your hand up on

572
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,519
not a time signature good anybody else

573
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,679
Vanessa you look at your

574
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:18,919
function it's a what I it's a

575
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,919
get yeah something that will'll get

576
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,799
what oops do I not

577
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,760
have oh sorry yes that won't return

578
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:34,559
anything if I don't put the um if I

579
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,440
don't put these brackets uh right

580
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,080
because I was trying to do it on a

581
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,799
function

582
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:46,120
and or oh this comes up by the way um in

583
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,159
your in um uh what you in problem sets

584
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,159
sometimes in answers the order matters

585
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,320
right I hadn't run the music 21 import

586
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,320
meter yet um just just something to keep

587
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,799
in mind always make sure when you're

588
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,279
done when you think your problem set's

589
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:02,080
done hit restart and run all and see if

590
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,799
it gets to the end because you might

591
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,960
have been solving a problem along the

592
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,760
way and then have oh you know in order

593
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,519
to solve question two I imported

594
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,080
something from question three but then

595
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,799
it's not ready when I run it so yeah so

596
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,919
now that we have this what

597
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,519
is here something called a recursive

598
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:26,279
iterator so is not a time signature how

599
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,080
do I get the time

600
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:34,679
signature from this we have this

601
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:38,600
anybody Hannah can index zero index

602
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:43,200
zero perfect it's um kind of like what

603
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:45,279
we did here indexing zero on a iterator

604
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,279
over scores but now we have something

605
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,120
that's indexing over the time signature

606
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,240
so we should be able to do this with if

607
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,000
I remember my

608
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,559
parentheses I do get used to an IDE that

609
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,200
fills in my parentheses for me uh which

610
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm not using and I can do index zero or

611
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,679
I can do

612
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,519
first um either one this is a particular

613
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,200
case where first will save you a lot of

614
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,000
time because you're pretty sure the time

615
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,880
signature should be at the beginning of

616
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,440
the score so once you hit one stop don't

617
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,240
go through the whole rest of the score

618
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,320
looking for more time signatures if you

619
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,320
only want the first one good so we have

620
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,919
the time

621
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,039
signature now what we can do is this is

622
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,159
something we haven't seen the ratio of a

623
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,880
time signature the three for something

624
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,279
is in its ratio string there's also a

625
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,440
numerator denominator but this is the

626
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,760
one that's pretty helpful um and then

627
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,039
meter

628
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,559
counter ratio which I be doing now if I

629
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,559
want to count

630
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:56,360
them plus equals one good and then at

631
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,360
the very end let's see our meter

632
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:05,799
counter so we have had hypotheses of 34

633
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,519
and 68 uh I put my money on

634
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,519
68 and oops what I

635
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:19,120
forget oh uh IRL that scores thank

636
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,639
you IRL scores because the first thing

637
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,639
there was a metadata

638
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,639
so what's our winner 3 four 34 our

639
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,559
runner up 44

640
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:46,080
44 and then then 68 at least 68 was on

641
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,360
those of us were 68 the 68 crew we we

642
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,519
did okay on there but yeah I might have

643
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,799
the difference between this being sung

644
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,000
music versus fiddle music I don't know

645
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,919
we can try uh some of the other things

646
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,440
in there by the way with with a counter

647
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,760
you can also do things like meter

648
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:07,760
counter. most common three most common

649
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,480
and see what they are in that

650
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,639
order

651
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,159
cool so that's one of the things we can

652
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:19,960
do with um with this

653
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,279
Corpus let's um let's jump over to the

654
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,440
bach Corpus for now uh for a little bit

655
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,799
are there questions about this I mean

656
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,679
that's just the tiniest little thing we

657
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,360
can figure out um all the think

658
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:34,399
questions that we had before with it oh

659
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,960
um here let's let's actually let's do

660
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,880
this um let's do with the type of

661
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,039
experiment that um that Sophia sun was

662
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:49,679
talking about uh with position on the

663
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:53,600
beat or whatever um let's look at where

664
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,600
notes with accidentals

665
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,240
up are they most

666
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,559
commonly so sort of in this little

667
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:06,440
passing position in the middle of the

668
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,919
bar or are they more often contradicting

669
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,919
right at the

670
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,039
downbeat

671
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:16,279
hypothesis who votes for accidentals

672
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,279
more in the middle of the

673
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:25,760
bar good seven eight and four on the

674
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,240
downbeat good uh who's not

675
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,279
participating that didn't addap one more

676
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,440
time at in the at the middle of the

677
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,440
bar or downbeat couple down good I don't

678
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,279
know what the answer to this is always

679
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,880
just be thinking about these these

680
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,279
things um so let's let's do the same

681
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,080
type of thing we can um we'll create

682
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:51,120
another counter and we'll we'll unlock

683
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,880
another little thing for you um so we'll

684
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,880
call this what

685
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,399
uh

686
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,159
accidental we're not counting

687
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,559
accidentals so maybe just accidental

688
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,679
positions and but maybe we don't even

689
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,399
want to do a counter maybe let's just do

690
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:16,800
a a list so so we can run averages on

691
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:19,440
it um now we be fair to compare um well

692
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,839
I don't know uh where in the measure it

693
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,399
is maybe we want to just say we'll just

694
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,919
look at the 21341 so that all of our

695
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,440
measures are the same length except for

696
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,440
um hopefully the pickup measure and the

697
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,679
end measure are rounding errors but

698
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,320
maybe not you know you know because they

699
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,440
don't have the same length so what we

700
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,079
can do

701
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,960
is again copy and paste probably if

702
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,639
we're doing this more we can get this

703
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,240
and

704
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,839
instead we want to get look at every

705
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,879
note so there's something called uh

706
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,400
notes on

707
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,359
this or actually actually we'll we'll do

708
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,079
it even better we haven't imported note

709
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:06,760
yet right from music 21

710
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:11,520
import

711
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:15,400
note um because of a bad decision I made

712
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,119
a while back um notes also will get you

713
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,320
chords if there are any chords in here

714
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,160
and chords we will get to soon they have

715
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,079
to be dealt with separately so we want

716
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,839
to say. recourse. get Elements by class

717
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,160
note. note but there's another way to do

718
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:30,240
that anyone remember

719
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,200
what's the shortcut for recurse get

720
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,599
Elements by

721
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,079
class yeah go ahead yeah you use like

722
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:41,680
the bracket the class good so we'll put

723
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,680
the bracket for n in

724
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:49,200
song note. note so that will get us

725
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:53,000
every note there and how do we filter

726
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,880
out ones with ACD without

727
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,359
accidentals so try that yourself try to

728
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,920
figure out pretty sure that this this is

729
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,280
right for now yep we got a whole bunch

730
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,760
of notes we want to filter out once

731
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,960
without

732
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,480
accidentals oh why do we have a five

733
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:18,040
space thing that bothers

734
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,040
me filter out no

735
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,920
accidentals we're going to have some

736
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,400
we might not get to the buck example

737
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,000
because I came up with this one and it's

738
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,520
a neat little twist I had forgotten

739
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,960
about go ahead interrupt the class and

740
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,440
let's and ask ask that for everybody in

741
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,079
a loud voice what of people think about

742
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,200
um accidentals and the qy signature are

743
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,800
we counting those as accidentals no no

744
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,839
no okay good so we're going to have to

745
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,640
do some that was the wrinkle that I

746
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,240
thought of one of the ways you could do

747
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,560
is you could say oh shoot okay we're

748
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,680
just going to look at uh ones with in

749
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,480
with with C major so we can do it but

750
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,720
presumably sometimes you can filter down

751
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,119
your Corpus to get rid of some Corner

752
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,359
cases that might be a little bit too

753
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,760
hard to to deal with at least in the

754
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:19,000
first run but getting rid of everything

755
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,160
but C major is probably not going to

756
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,079
leave us with enough of a corpus

757
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,680
so let's temporarily

758
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,319
unlock a second module from music 21

759
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,319
import

760
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:39,680
key and first let's get the first key

761
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:42,160
signature for each um thing so we can

762
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,680
do uh what do how do we get the first

763
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,520
key signature in the piece let's assume

764
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,520
that for now that it doesn't switch key

765
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:57,839
signatures song. recurse

766
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,760
parentheses song. recurse parenthesis.

767
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,880
get

768
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:06,599
Elements by class or what's the simpler

769
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,800
way square bracket square bracket key

770
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,119
dot I'll tell you it's key

771
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,119
signature do

772
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:21,200
first so first let's filter out

773
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:23,079
everything that um so now let me let me

774
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,880
make a little instruction man I wish I

775
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,560
could edit at this part so let's let's

776
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:33,480
go back always work through one score so

777
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:37,240
we have the lady score and we'll get KS

778
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:41,400
equals lady uh was it my lady Fair um

779
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:44,960
lady key I didn't I didn't import key

780
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,960
yet from music

781
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:50,880
21 let's pause for a little bit and help

782
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,000
help me help get me get caught up and so

783
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,160
that anybody watching this later can get

784
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,040
CAU can you all come with me for a

785
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,960
second and I

786
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,200
for a

787
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,680
second thanks um Can can somebody tell

788
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,119
me what I should be putting here what um

789
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:13,640
I think we're mostly at about this line

790
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,800
together so uh who have I not heard from

791
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,760
very

792
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,800
much

793
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Angelica okay so M doesn't work but I

794
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:29,359
tried to like say if the if end. pitch

795
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:34,040
accidental and if the KE signature docid

796
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:37,560
uh and then and name and sorry and um

797
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:41,760
ks. accidental

798
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,760
bystep n.

799
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,400
name good that's a pretty good start uh

800
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,280
I might change one thing on it anybody

801
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,880
else anyone have a suggestion of one

802
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,839
thing to change on

803
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,880
that so we're looking to see there is an

804
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,480
accidental and there is an accidental

805
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,119
yeah oh change name to step change name

806
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,640
to step so the difference between name

807
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,079
and step accidental by step expects a

808
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:13,440
step

809
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:19,640
C's name is c c step is start it

810
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,640
out nobody knows total mystery C good

811
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,160
step I know you knew that but just we'll

812
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:32,240
keep keep that going good so so what's

813
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:35,560
the this logic if the note pitch has an

814
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,160
accidental and there is an accidental

815
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,319
there then what um anybody feel

816
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,839
confident that they can code the next

817
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:47,800
line of this even if you didn't have

818
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:51,040
this then or or even just logically what

819
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,040
do we have what do we want to do

820
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,839
now if they're the same uhuh we don't

821
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,720
add one okay if they're the same we

822
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,640
don't add one good uh if n. pitch.

823
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,920
accidental and

824
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:11,440
equals ks. accidental by

825
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,440
step and do

826
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,280
step uh what is it something plus equals

827
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:20,599
zero we won't do anything no we can pass

828
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,240
um since we want to do something at this

829
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:26,280
point what how can we flip

830
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,240
those how can we flip it so we can add

831
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,599
this don't worry we'll we we'll improve

832
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,599
um some of the redund see in a

833
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,119
second if it's like this we don't want

834
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,599
to do anything if it's not like this

835
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,240
what do we want to do add one so how can

836
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:49,200
we how can we save ourselves I suppose

837
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,880
we can put else something plus equals

838
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,520
one

839
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,960
but I can do a a not not equal if these

840
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,400
are not equal

841
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,160
equal then we can do that so that could

842
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,599
work what's another another thing I can

843
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,680
um probably save

844
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,160
some save some

845
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:16,119
redundancy let's store these things at

846
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,000
ACC equals n. pitch.

847
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,680
accidental K uh

848
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,400
ksx

849
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:27,680
equals this when you find yourself

850
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,240
writing something twice in two Lin

851
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,240
you will probably continue to write

852
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,800
it and so we can do this we might even

853
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,920
be able to reduce this further because

854
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:51,640
python will allow you to um compare none

855
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,680
not equal to something else

856
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,359
but good does that cover all the cases

857
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,640
we have an accidental

858
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,760
we have the um axol in the key and by

859
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,880
the way that was great thank you for

860
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,880
getting us going on the right path um

861
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,839
and we have something that's uh and we

862
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,280
have a key signature accidental and so

863
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:12,079
we have an accidental on the note we

864
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,280
have a key signature accidental and the

865
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,480
two are not equal to each other so

866
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,640
therefore we we're going to add one to

867
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,480
something we'll figure out what we're

868
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,720
going to add something but we care about

869
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,200
that note right any other notes we care

870
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,880
about yeah what about notes where the

871
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,640
key signature has them sharped or

872
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,760
flatted but then we natural them okay

873
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,040
good good and the problem with the

874
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,800
natural is

875
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,760
what technically it's not an accidental

876
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,839
technically it's not an

877
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,119
accidental this is a thing that I did to

878
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,480
speed up so that there would be one

879
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:52,760
fewer object creation back in 2004 2005

880
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,880
when object creation was still something

881
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,079
that was slow in Python do I regret not

882
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,520
putting an accidental of natural on

883
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:05,480
every single note now yes I do regret

884
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,680
that here's a a trick that uh I've

885
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,200
started to do a lot since I don't really

886
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,160
care we'll import pitch for a

887
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:18,640
second music 21

888
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:22,520
import pitch and we'll just make one um

889
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,160
g u natural and I'll put it in all caps

890
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,440
because that means to me that I'm going

891
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,040
to try as much as possible never to

892
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,040
mutate this

893
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:37,680
so one of the things we could do now

894
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:40,000
is since none returns falsy so therefore

895
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,800
we continue in the or we can say The

896
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,680
Accidental is this one or natural and

897
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,079
this one is or

898
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:52,720
natural now we are always comparing

899
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,720
apples to or Apples to

900
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,160
Apples so this is just a little

901
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,720
programming trick and um in case you

902
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:06,280
really care about the runtime I only had

903
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,920
to create one extra accidental object I

904
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,880
think that should

905
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,960
work I see some confusing

906
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,559
yeah why can't we just have the equal

907
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,520
sign there's

908
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:23,359
object not compare sorry can you say a

909
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,640
little bit louder both for me and others

910
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,599
yeah like uh once we have The Accidental

911
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,359
and signature yep um why do we need to

912
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,000
have the or natural like if we're

913
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:35,200
comparing the not equals in the next

914
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
line will that not work with uh yeah so

915
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:43,040
so for what one of the reasons might be

916
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,040
um yeah it's true we probably

917
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,240
don't wait no no then then we get to

918
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,800
Matthew's case what what case does this

919
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,079
not

920
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,200
cover I don't see a case that this

921
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,079
doesn't

922
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,240
cover great um

923
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,319
so here's the case that doesn't cover um

924
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:08,800
KS again is our D major thing

925
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:16,440
accidental by step of

926
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:23,319
G is none right um n equals note. note

927
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:26,440
gsh gar 4 great next n equals note. note

928
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:28,559
G4 when I generate this it's going to

929
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,200
get an accidental because it needs uh

930
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,839
something so you're going to end up with

931
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:38,559
n do next. pitch.

932
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:41,400
accidental um oops pitch. accidental

933
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:44,200
equals pitch.

934
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:48,240
accidental natural because it will

935
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,880
actually have a natural sign and

936
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,480
then

937
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:58,839
then then this line up here next

938
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,839
n. pitch. accidental

939
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:11,280
tool does it equal KS accidental by step

940
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,480
G oops what I forget didn't I import

941
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,680
pitch or did

942
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,480
I I never ran

943
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:21,200
that I typed that but I forgot to run it

944
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,960
false because this is a natural an

945
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,960
explicit accidental of natural and this

946
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,640
is a none

947
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:34,400
not a none like the ones that where the

948
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,040
habits and go around but n o n e so

949
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,280
that's that's the particular case now

950
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:43,000
one of the things we never talked about

951
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:46,040
is do pitch how do accidentals compare

952
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,800
first we want to make sure does one

953
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,720
accidental flat equals

954
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,520
another

955
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,680
accidental

956
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,680
flat yes they do

957
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,880
so that's that's the reason why I put in

958
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:08,640
these um or uh where' they go or

959
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:12,400
natural so that I'm always comparing

960
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,200
Apples to Apples great idea yeah

961
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,559
duse how the example didn't we want it

962
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,359
to be false didn't we want it to be

963
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:23,559
false like in in the extra thing you

964
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:25,599
just wrote in the extra

965
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:27,319
thing yeah

966
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,760
that right

967
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:33,319
we want this one to be false because

968
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:37,400
we're in we're in D Major right G's um

969
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:41,960
accidental on G is none right so this is

970
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,800
none and this is a natural but the note

971
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,119
is still going to be a g natural it's

972
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,760
just one of them is represented with no

973
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:49,440
accidental and the other is represented

974
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,520
with The Accidental of

975
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,240
natural so oh you're saying having the

976
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,480
natural

977
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,839
sign so by putting the

978
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:08,160
natural so I've defined this now um ACC

979
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:13,119
equals next ends pitch. accidental or

980
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:17,520
natural what's ACC now it's a natural um

981
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:21,720
KS key signature is accidental equals KS

982
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:25,280
accidental by step

983
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,280
G or

984
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:33,839
natural KS accidental is now also a

985
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:37,839
natural ACC equals KS accidental is now

986
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:40,079
true the notion that um that you don't

987
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,280
care about the difference between a g

988
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,040
that has no accidental and a g that has

989
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:49,200
an accidental of natural right in this

990
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,480
case we do

991
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,079
not so

992
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,960
um does that does that start to clarify

993
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,119
things okay here here's some here some

994
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,760
notes let's let's always go back to

995
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,160
actual music that's how this that's

996
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,119
that's why we're confused we haven't

997
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,480
looked at some actual music in a little

998
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,839
while so we're in D Major here we have

999
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:13,440
two sharps uh Let's ignore the time

1000
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:16,960
signature for now and now we have um

1001
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,960
something like

1002
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:38,079
how many how many notes Here contradict

1003
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:42,000
the K the um key

1004
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:45,599
signature if we look at this one one

1005
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,920
which one dot dot that g

1006
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,280
Shar but this hasn't what is the The

1007
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,280
Accidental on this note is

1008
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,319
probably

1009
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,640
none The Accidental on this note is

1010
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,640
almost certainly

1011
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,440
natural and the key signatures give me

1012
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,400
another color the

1013
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:15,599
chos

1014
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:18,319
of would go right here The Accidental by

1015
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:22,280
step for

1016
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,280
G is

1017
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,599
none so in this case these two would

1018
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,359
compare

1019
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,359
equal but these two would

1020
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,400
not not a very good instructor of

1021
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,280
software engineering today sorry about

1022
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,000
that but I'll try to get better any

1023
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,880
other questions again we have about four

1024
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,680
or five minutes I'd love to um try to

1025
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,760
get a little bit further in this so I'm

1026
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:54,559
going to jump back oh we have something

1027
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:58,079
I never did let's just let's just make

1028
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,119
it um in interest of time we'll we'll

1029
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,280
say We'll create a counter and just keep

1030
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:06,359
track of downbeat versus non-d downbeat

1031
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,200
um so what we'll say

1032
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:11,799
is if the accidental is not the same as

1033
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,599
the key signature accidental then we

1034
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:15,520
want then it's an interesting note so

1035
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,799
then we want to know if it's on the

1036
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,720
downbeat or off the downbeat what what

1037
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:21,480
do y all use to figure out if something

1038
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,000
was on the

1039
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,400
downbeat what' you say off offset right

1040
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,359
so if the note

1041
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,720
offset and here is where recurse and

1042
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:34,920
flat are going to be very different

1043
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,280
right because recurses offset is with

1044
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,599
respect

1045
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:42,000
to

1046
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:44,160
what the measure the measure and flatten

1047
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,079
offset is with respect

1048
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,880
to

1049
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:52,760
what the start the start of the score

1050
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,599
yep start of the piece start score start

1051
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,960
yep of of whatever it is so this one we

1052
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,480
want this

1053
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,599
here if the offset is in 1.0 we can say

1054
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:06,880
accidental positions I'm going to do

1055
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:11,160
that for I don't know

1056
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:15,559
downbeat plus equals 1

1057
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:19,559
else accidental did I somehow not type

1058
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:22,160
properly there we go dental

1059
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,640
positions

1060
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:29,040
offbeat plus equals

1061
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:32,520
1 oh the other thing um that we might

1062
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,720
want to do is eventually normalize this

1063
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,640
for how many notes are on the downbeat

1064
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,359
versus how many notes are on the offbeat

1065
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,520
you all know about normalization right

1066
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,680
you want to figure out how much more

1067
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,119
likely is it no but but I can look at

1068
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:49,599
the time and see we're not going to be

1069
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:52,520
able to do all that so

1070
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:56,880
um yeah so

1071
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:59,760
let's I think this might work I'm

1072
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,440
so let's look at the accidental

1073
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,240
positions and I'm only looking at 3 four

1074
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,240
ones you might

1075
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,599
be anybody get something like that

1076
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,960
Hannah you had some

1077
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:16,000
results oh I did it a little differ but

1078
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,520
I had a completely different output yep

1079
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,119
but what but did it's it's kind of great

1080
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,160
when we have two different people doing

1081
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:24,040
different way so you have a slightly

1082
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:27,200
different output did you find that

1083
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,880
something like this in your result or um

1084
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,319
I took the average the average like

1085
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,079
where it appears in the meure guess uhuh

1086
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:38,240
so I guess the I got was like closer to

1087
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:40,599
the down be I think you got it it was a

1088
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,640
little bit closer to the down be great

1089
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:44,480
actually no it's like closer to the

1090
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,480
middle closer to the middle

1091
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,079
fantastic I'll give you one um one

1092
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:53,960
little thing as as we do it that might

1093
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,880
be interesting going forward um when

1094
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:59,160
have time to implement this but I will

1095
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:04,319
be un locking this for you right now for

1096
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:11,200
n in let's just look at lady note.

1097
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:13,799
note print n and n's beat

1098
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,599
strength we'll look at this a little bit

1099
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:19,599
and this tells you um here do we have

1100
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:21,680
the I think somewhere I have the score

1101
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,599
again sorry I wish I could split this

1102
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,880
here so the first D is on the downbeat

1103
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:29,280
and then we're going to go up to F

1104
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:34,200
natural and the D C natural and when we

1105
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,200
look at this oops

1106
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,960
later we can see we have the three

1107
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,680
pickup notes and then we have something

1108
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,640
on the downbeat and then we have a bunch

1109
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:50,280
of offbeat things yep beat strength um

1110
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,880
is just a really really hacky thing I

1111
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,760
threw together in probably about the

1112
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,920
same amount of time as this thing is

1113
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,680
here that tries to measure as a number

1114
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:05,079
between Epsilon and one there is no beat

1115
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:09,319
strength of zero but um how strong the

1116
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:12,400
position of the note within its measure

1117
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:14,079
is I cannot believe how many times I've

1118
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,079
seen it referenced in papers now I've

1119
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,799
used it in papers and things like that

1120
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,680
and I uh you know now the world knows uh

1121
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:24,039
that this was this terrible hack that

1122
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,839
could probably be done much much much

1123
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:28,720
better as you will realize when you do

1124
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:30,079
beat strengths on triplets and things

1125
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,119
because you can kind of see I'm doing

1126
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,400
something about the log two of the

1127
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:37,240
proportion through the measure and

1128
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,079
therefore triplets won't work as well or

1129
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,480
anything so I think we do something

1130
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:44,880
separate for 68 so it works but um this

1131
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,880
could be used to give you a little bit

1132
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,000
more of a sense of the kind of problem

1133
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,880
that Sophia sun was talking about in the

1134
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
video at the beginning of the class are

1135
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,839
certain things happen more on strong

1136
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
places versus others okay can you um can

1137
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,640
you close what you're working on for

1138
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
just a second and that's also the cue

1139
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,720
that I'm going to let you go just so I

1140
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,760
can have uh some eyes and things so what

1141
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,720
your the next problem set you're working

1142
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,280
on this one but just just don't pck up

1143
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,839
for one second is going to be looking

1144
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,440
trying to find yourself an interesting

1145
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:19,119
Corpus um whether or not you decide to

1146
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,680
end working on a corpus study at the end

1147
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,920
of the semester or not it's probably

1148
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,640
good to know that we do not want to just

1149
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,280
continue working with the bach Corrals

1150
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,079
and the Irish folk songs and the Chinese

1151
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,280
folk songs these three data sets are

1152
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,839
everywhere for the rest of our lives so

1153
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,359
we want to have that out you're going to

1154
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,599
be asked to do that and to write up what

1155
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:37,000
you find about something and you're

1156
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,799
going to be asked to do it in teams of

1157
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,480
two your only um condition is that you

1158
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,720
cannot be on a team with somebody that

1159
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,599
you did the last group problem set with

1160
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,920
so find somebody who was not in that

1161
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:50,520
problem set and do that and I I wanted

1162
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,720
to give you some extra time for that

1163
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:55,039
great um it's a little bit more on the

1164
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,400
Sophia sun and my article online that

1165
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:02,760
you can watch today or in the canvas or

1166
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,760
later and thank you
