00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,519
education and climate change new

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,360
multidisciplinary climate change

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,120
curriculum for high schools aims to

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,560
engage and mobilize teachers and

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
students written by Lita

Zimmerman several years ago Christopher

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,119
kid's father then a math teacher shared

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,519
a mailing he had received at his high

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,279
school when he opened the packet alarm

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,160
Bells went off for kidle who is the

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,119
George P Schultz professor of energy

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,279
economics at the MIT slone School

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,000
management and the deputy director for

15
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,600
policy at the MIT energy initiative

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,600
Mighty it was a slickly produced package

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,440
of materials purporting to show how to

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,239
teach climate change he says in reality

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,640
it was a thinly veiled attempt to Kindle

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
climate change denial kidle was

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
especially concerned to learn that this

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,680
package had been distributed to schools

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,600
Nationwide many teachers in search of

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,359
information on climate change might use

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,879
this material because they are not in a

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,280
position to judge its scientific

27
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,519
validity says kidle who is also The

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,000
Faculty director of the MIT Center for

29
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,960
Energy and environmental policy research

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,159
Seer I decided that MIT which is

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,920
committed to True science was in the

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,720
perfect position to develop its own

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,520
climate change curriculum today kidle is

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,479
spearheading the climate action through

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,680
education Kate program a curriculum

36
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,479
rolling out in Pilot form this year in

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
more than a dozen Massachusetts high

38
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,119
schools and eventually in high schools

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,479
across the United States to Spur its

40
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,680
broad adoption says kidle the K

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,840
curriculum features a unique Suite of

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,799
attributes the creation of climate-based

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,360
lessons for a range of disciplines

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,479
Beyond science adherence to state-based

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,119
education standards to facilitate

46
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,719
integration into established curriculum

47
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,159
material connecting climate change

48
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,960
impacts of specific regions and

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,799
opportunities for students to explore

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,920
climate Solutions Kate aims to engage

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,920
both students and teachers in a subject

52
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,520
that can be overwhelming we will be

53
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,600
honest about the threats posed by

54
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,240
climate change but also give students a

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,880
sense of agency that they can do

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,119
something about this says kidle and for

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,879
the many teachers especially non-science

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,759
teachers starve for knowledge and

59
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,680
background material Kate offers

60
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,120
resources to give them confidence to

61
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,360
implement our

62
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,959
curriculum partnering with

63
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,720
teachers from the outset Kate sought

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,200
guidance and Hands-On development help

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,239
from Educators project manager Ashling

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,319
ogrady survey teachers to learn about

67
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,319
their experiences teaching about climate

68
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,519
and to identify the kinds of resources

69
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,959
they lacked

70
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,760
she networked with mit's K through2

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,319
education experts and with anre

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,400
Danielson Mighty Director of Education

73
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,840
bouncing ideas off of them to shape the

74
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,720
direction of her effort she says she

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,959
gained two critical insights from this

76
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,560
process I realized that we needed

77
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,680
practicing High School teachers as

78
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,040
curriculum developers and that they had

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,720
to represent different subject areas

80
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,480
because climate change is inherently

81
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,480
interdisciplinary she says this Echoes

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,360
the philosophy behind mighty's energy

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,159
studies minor she remarks

84
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,840
which includes classes from mit's

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,959
different schools while science helps us

86
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,959
understand and find solutions for

87
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,440
climate change it touches so many other

88
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,680
areas from economics policy

89
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,959
environmental justice and politics to

90
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,040
history and literature in line with this

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,360
thinking Kate recruited Massachusetts

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
teachers representing key subject areas

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,920
in the High School curriculum Amy block

94
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,000

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
Newton South High School where he has

102
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,000
worked for 24 years kosek became engaged

103
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
with environmental issues 15 years ago

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
introducing an elective and

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,319
sustainability at Newton South he serves

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
on the Coordinating Committee for the

107
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,720
climate Action Network of the

108
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,840
Massachusetts Teachers Association he

109
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,239
also is president of Earth Day Boston

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,680
and organized Boston's 50th an iversary

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,640
celebration of earth when he learned

112
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,680
that MIT was seeking teachers to help

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,040
develop a climate education curriculum

114
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,799
he immediately applied I've heard time

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,400
and again from teachers across the state

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,040
that they want to incorporate climate

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,560
change into the curriculum but don't

118
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,079
know how to make it work given lesson

119
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,720
plans and schedules geared toward

120
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,959
preparing students for specific tests

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,960
says kak I knew that for a climate

122
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,880
curriculum to succeed it had to be part

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
of an integrated

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,320
approach using climate as a

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,479
lens over the course of a year kak and

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,560
fellow Educators created units that fit

127
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,120
into their pre-existing syllabi but were

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,600
woven through with relevant climate

129
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,560
change themes kak already had some

130
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,360
experience in this vein describing the

131
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
role of the Industrial Revolution in

132
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,759
triggering the use of fossil fuels and

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,520
the greenhouse gas emissions that

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,400
resulted for Kate kak explored

135
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,759
additional ways of Shifting focus and

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,520
covering US history there are for

137
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,759
instance lessons looking at West

138
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,160
expansion in terms of land use expulsion

139
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,280
of indigenous people and environmental

140
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,840
justice and at the baby boom period in

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,240
the emergence of the environmental

142
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,280
movement in English language arts there

143
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,360
are units dedicated to explaining terms

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,800
used by scientists and policy makers

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,880
such as anthropogenic as well as lessons

146
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,720
devoted to climate change fiction and to

147
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,919
student originated sustainability

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,479
projects the science and math classes

149
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,120
work independently but also dovetail for

150
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,199
instance there are science lessons that

151
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,080
demystify the greenhouse effect

152
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,800
utilizing experiments to track fossil

153
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,720
fuel emissions which link to math

154
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,479
lessons that calculate and graph the

155
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,520
average rate of change of global carbon

156
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,280
emissions to make these classes even

157
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
more relevant there are Labs where

158
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,560
students compare carbon emissions in

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,319
Massachusetts to those of a neighboring

160
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
state and where they determine the

161
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,600
environmental and economic costs of

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,680
plugging in electric devices in their

186
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,000
diverse pool of teachers who thought the

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,759
lessons were fantastic but among their

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,919
suggestions noted that their student

189
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,599
cohorts included new English speakers

190
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,039

useful to us and we revised the

193
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,639
curriculum because we want to reach

194
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,080
students at every level of

195
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,800
learning reaching all the

196
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,680
schools now the K curriculum is in the

197
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,000
hands of a cohort of Massachusetts

198
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,720
teachers each of these educ ERS will

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,919
test one or more of the lessons and lab

200
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,479
activities over the next year checking

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,960
in regularly with MIT Partners to report

202
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,879
on their classroom experiences the Kate

203
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,879
team is building a climate education

204
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,360
Resource Network of MIT graduate

205
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,319
students postdocs and research staff who

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,560
can answer teachers specific climate

207
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,520
questions and help them find additional

208
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,280
resources or data sets additionally

209
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,919
teachers will have the opportunity to

210
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,759
attend two in-person cohort meetings and

211
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,039
be paired with graduate student climate

212
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,680
advisers

213
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,720

conversations with their families at

223
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
home says ogrady by creating a positive

224
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,159
experience around their curriculum in

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
these pilot schools the Kate team hopes

226
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,159
to promote its dissemination to many

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,440
more massachusett schools in 23 the team

228
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,879
plans on enhancing lessons offering more

229
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,720
paths to integration in high school

230
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,919
studies and creating a companion

resource website for teachers kidle

232
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,319
wants to establish footholds in school

233
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,919
after school in Massachusetts and Beyond

234
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,759
I plan to spend a lot of my time

235
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,199
convincing districts and states to adopt

236
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,159
he says if one teacher tells another

237
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,879
that the curriculum is useful with touch

238
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,159
points in different disciplines that's

239
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,599
how we get a foot in the door kidle is

240
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,039
not shying away from places where

241
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,639
climate change is a politicized topic he

242
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,120
hopes to team up with universities and

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,039
states where there might be resistance

244
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,320
to including such lessons in schools to

245
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,200
develop the curriculum although as day

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,919
job involves Computing household level

247
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,800
carbon Footprints determining the

248
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,640
relationship between driving behavior

249
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,399
and the price of gasoline and promoting

250
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,640
wise climate policy kle plans to push

251
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,680
Pate as far as he can I want this

252
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,240
curriculum to be adopted by everybody

253
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,880
that's my goal he says in one sense I'm

254
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,760
not the natural person for this job he

255
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,360
admits but I share the mission and

256
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,360
passion of Mighty and Seer for

257
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,839
decarbonizing our economy in ways that

258
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,600
are socially Equitable and efficient and

259
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,600
part of doing that is educating

260
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,279
Americans about the actual costs and

261
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,920
consequences of climate

262
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,560
change the K program is sponsored by

263
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,800
Mighty Seer and the MIT vice president

264
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,800
for research
