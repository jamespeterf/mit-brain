1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,240
okay good morning it will take us a

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,439
couple of U lectures I guess to cover

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
this

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,119
um uh in uh in some

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
details and it is

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,199
um we want to

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,200
extend what we know about heat transfer

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,680
to e and mass transfer and charge

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,680
transfer and we want to do it uh in in

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,960
in a way that uh exhibits the the logic

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,760
of the construction so um this is why I

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,879
am going to restart I mean start again

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,559
from what we have already seen because

14
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,760
it already contains that

15
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,079
logic uh actually parallel logic between

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,280
the what we've done in chemical kinetics

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,960
and what we've done in in in our simple

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960
review of the heat transfer

19
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,159
Basics and because this contains what we

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:21,720
want to develop item by item with some

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:25,439
care uh and and other details uh in in

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,799
the rest of this uh lecture or

23
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,720
two so in chemical kinetics let's start

24
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,320
with because we did this first so let's

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,960
start with this first

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,399
we when we when we consider the closed

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,320
systems uh we considered that like the

28
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:48,079
energy balance it was implicit that the

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,520
energy remains constant if the system is

30
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,399
isolated and this is the entropy balance

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,960
that says that the rate of

32
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,240
entropy uh change is equal to the

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,240
entropy produced by irreversibility

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,959
then

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,599
um we this is not a balance of of of of

36
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,640
particles but you could view the

37
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,760
proportionality relations as as a sort

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,239
of a balance in the sense that uh they

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,239
account for uh the rate of change of the

40
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,680
number of of particles in your in your

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,400
mixture and so that

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,160
is another ingredient

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,120
plus we have assumed something about

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,560
equilibrium near

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,120
equilibrium uh situation in which we uh

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,200
if it weren't for the uh chemical

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,800
reactions that are changing the

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,760
composition our system in our model uh

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:59,440
um so far is

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,840
um very close to what it would be if it

51
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,760
were in equilibrium in a stable

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,640
equilibrium State we without the

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,799
reactions

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,239
on and

55
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:17,120
that allows us so this relation here

56
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:19,959
allows us to evaluate uh the uh rate of

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,480
change of the entropy which is needed

58
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,920
for the entropy balance so we evaluate

59
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,000
that and when we do the that rate of

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,480
change uh since s depends the only thing

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,480
that is changing here is n through the

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,760
proportionality relation so you have to

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,360
take the partial of s with respect to n

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,760
times n the rate of change of

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,239
N and then uh you keep going and we you

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,879
you single out the affinities of the

67
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,360
reaction and um you bring in the

68
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,040
reaction rate

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,360
rates so you combine

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,480
them this balance equation with the

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,799
energy balance which is Trivial in this

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,920
case and you obtain an expression for

73
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,760
the entropy produced by reversibility

74
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,840
which is this product of U uh rates and

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,720
affinities that we interpreted as

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
degrees of this

77
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:28,199
equilibrium and then we assumed um a law

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,800
that relates how the

79
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:38,080
rates uh relates the rates to the uh

80
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,199
affinities and this law is a nonlinear

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,840
law but in the near equilibrium

82
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,840
limit we have linearized

83
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,520
it here's the parallel structure and

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,919
parallel logic that we followed when we

85
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,440
derived when we did the heat transfer

86
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,360
basis we write the energy balance

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,919
it takes this form we will return to why

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,320
it takes this form for the moment just

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,960
uh uh believe believe

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:16,320
it so that's the energy balance this is

91
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,080
the entropy balance also of course we'll

92
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,560
return on

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,479
this there is we're talking about a

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,720
solid so there a pure solid there's no

95
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,639
changing composition so the the the rate

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,199
of change of composition is

97
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,440
zero then we assume like we did here we

98
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,960
assume something about the local

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,960
equilibrium we assume local

100
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,479
equilibrium so that there is a

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,080
fundamental relation we can write the

102
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,720
Gibs relation for between this the

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:56,039
properties and this is a way to write

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,360
the Gibs relation in order to uh

105
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,960
um we will also see this in more detail

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,560
later

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,039
um this is in order to get rid of the

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:13,400
pressure here and push the pressure in

109
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,400
the Gibs DM um independent

110
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:22,520
equation the Gibs relation can be

111
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,039
used to combine the left hand sides of

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,479
the balance

113
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,639
equations so you substitute the various

114
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,720
balance equations into this Gibs

115
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,560
relation

116
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,840
and

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,840
obtain an expression like here for the

118
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,280
entropy produced by

119
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,120
reversibility of course we will do the

120
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,960
details also because here I'm I'm uh

121
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,599
I've changed the the notation a bit but

122
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:53,280
as you know for heat transfer uh the

123
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:56,879
energy flux is just qou Prime and the

124
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,759
entropy flux is Q Prime over T that's

125
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,680
the heat interaction

126
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,280
and when we do we do these substitutions

127
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:11,919
you can rewrite the Divergence of

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,599
JS uh in as a sum of two terms the first

129
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,560
one cancels with the the one that comes

130
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,680
from the Divergence of the energy flux

131
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,400
and you are left with this final result

132
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,199
that says that the entropy produced by

133
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,240
reversibility and here we're talking

134
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,400
about entropy per unit produced per

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,360
unit uh

136
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,199
volume is equal

137
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,000
to uh the heat flux times the gradient

138
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,639
in uh the inverse temperature which we

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,319
can interpret as the degree of dise

140
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,319
equilibrium for the heat

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,159
transfer and then if we assume a linear

142
00:07:53,039 --> 00:08:00,080
law then we get uh

143
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:04,159
forier in other words if you by looking

144
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,440
at this expression here if knowing that

145
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,919
the entropy produced by reversibility

146
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,879
must be

147
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,840
negative um the simple way is to assume

148
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:19,440
that Q uh is that the

149
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,120
flux is proportional to the gradient

150
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,280
through a a positive constant of

151
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,680
proportionality which could and actually

152
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,840
since it is a a vector the most General

153
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,680
linear relation between two vectors is

154
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,240
through a tensor so we take a positive

155
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,200
tensor in between here which assures

156
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,440
assures that the the sigma is going to

157
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,120
be non-

158
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:52,480
negative and then uh so we get for LA

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,080
and also we we have seen that if we

160
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,440
accept onager

161
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:05,079
reciprocity uh theorem that um that

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:07,040
tensor not only needs to be positive

163
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:11,160
definite but or non negative definite

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,800
but it also needs to be

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,720
symmetric you can also invert it and

166
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,160
therefore the the

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,240
entropy uh production becomes a

168
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,959
quadratic

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,800
form in the degrees of dise equilibrium

170
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:32,120
or equivalently a quadratic form in in

171
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,120
the

172
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:40,720
flues okay

173
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:45,360
so the ingredients are write the energy

174
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,279
balance uh do something about the um

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,399
Gibs relation or write the Gibs relation

176
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,760
in this form so that you can combine

177
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:58,240
these balances in in a proper

178
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,079
way make an assumption about the kind of

179
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,760
interaction that is

180
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:07,720
intercurrent between uh the

181
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,720
various Parcels or elements of your

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,519
Continuum and then assume if you want to

183
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
be near equilibrium you can assume a

184
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,920
linear uh

185
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:23,360
relation um and uh if you want to

186
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,839
discuss uh uh non equ more non

187
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,959
equilibrium I mean not not near equil

188
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,440
far from

189
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:34,240
equilibrium uh

190
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,240
then you need to develop some more

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
elaborate

192
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,519
theories and also

193
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,200
here there is space as we have seen for

194
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,360
the

195
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,920
katano

196
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:56,200
um correction to

197
00:10:50,920 --> 00:11:00,399
foro there is space to uh account also

198
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:04,160
to solve some of the problems of of the

199
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,279
felo the the infinite speed of

200
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,440
propagation that is

201
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,560
uh implied by this

202
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,160
expression so let's

203
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:21,959
start we take them one by one

204
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,519
so we have to be patient but uh there is

205
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,079
and this will give us also some

206
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,639
opportunity

207
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,000
to uh

208
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,839
highlight a few of the details this

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,360
procedure that I am

210
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:41,360
describing

211
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,839
um varies depending on the field of

212
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,639
application in particular I need to

213
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,440
mention but I'm not going to follow uh

214
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,480
precisely or but there is strong

215
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,720
connections with a famous procedure

216
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:01,480
called under the names of col Colman and

217
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:06,480
null uh which is a uh um

218
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,880
used more in the by the the community of

219
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,160
solid

220
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,079
mechanics uh people that study um

221
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,360
plasticity Vis

222
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,880
elasticity uh

223
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,959
um for

224
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,600
example not to go too far if you go to

225
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,480
Professor lit Anand in the this

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
department he has written books and he's

227
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,519
renowned for that

228
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,720
procedure

229
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:40,519
um I am more inclined since I have

230
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,240
studied with um people in uh in the

231
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,240
fluid mechanics

232
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:53,040
area I I'm more uh inclined to describe

233
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,120
the procedure that applies for fluid

234
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,720
mechanics kind of

235
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,120
applications but the the Logics are very

236
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
similar

237
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,920
except when it comes to this

238
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,279
generalization of the heat interaction

239
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,360
that instead is peculiar of course of of

240
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:16,240
our course here because

241
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,880
uh because also the definition of heat

242
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,199
is peculiar to to our

243
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:28,199
course not yet uh uh very widespread in

244
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:29,880
the textbooks uh or other scientific

245
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,279
papers

246
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,720
okay

247
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:38,639
so let's start with this uh

248
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,320
simple take a piece of

249
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,600
material fluid

250
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,320
element see already the fact that I call

251
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,320
it fluid uh means it shows you my

252
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,320
inclination

253
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,440
um and as you know U this department has

254
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,460
had a very

255
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
um influential

256
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,959
[Music]

257
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:10,959
professors in um fluid mechanics and he

258
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,959
transferred Rosen now uh Shapiro

259
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,480
sonin just to mention a

260
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,880
few

261
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:26,839
so I have this uh onedimensional piece

262
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:29,199
of of fluid and it's subjected to

263
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,480
interactions on one side and on the

264
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,480
other

265
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,680
side and when we did the heat transfer

266
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,000
we were considering only uh energy and

267
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:47,600
entropy now here we're going to

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,600
introduce also uh flux of

269
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,759
particles

270
00:14:51,959 --> 00:15:01,600
and uh and also here you have a the flux

271
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,160
the flux this is a component the X

272
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,680
component because we are one dimensional

273
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:13,120
of the flux and it changes as you move

274
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:17,440
from uh face at X and face at X Plus DX

275
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,560
and the area of exchange between the

276
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:25,600
adjacent uh between this fluid element

277
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,480
and the uh the one to its right is a and

278
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,279
also

279
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,160
uh the area on the other side of course

280
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,160
is again

281
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,880
a we we want to make a general energy

282
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,279
balance so we're not going to assume

283
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,279
steady

284
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:54,399
state so we call the energy of uh

285
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,399
the fluid in this

286
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,959
lamina Delta e why Delta because it's

287
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,880
infinitesimal since the thickness is

288
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,360
infinitesimal it's from X to D X Plus DX

289
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,360
so that is is an infinite asmal amount

290
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,160
of

291
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,720
energy uh related to the fact that it

292
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,240
has an infinitesimal amount of volume

293
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,240
which is the given by the area times the

294
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:30,600
X and uh the specific energy per unit

295
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,800
volume you can write it as we know like

296
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,959
uh row times U and U here is is really U

297
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,680
star what we call it's the energy per

298
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,680
unit

299
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,720
Mass all right so you you write it un

300
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,600
need volume and then you we we can also

301
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,639
substitute the volume for a *

302
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:00,759
DX the same

303
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:03,959
uh Al I mean this system has Al uh

304
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,880
entropy and here's the entropy also

305
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,280
infinitesimal because it's an

306
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,319
infinitesimal amount of of

307
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,000
material and it's it stays like that so

308
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,799
uh it's the the volume times the

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,199
specific entrop entropy per unit volume

310
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,199
which is row times s

311
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,919
star and also the amounts they are

312
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:35,520
infinitesimal

313
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:38,000
and the amount per unit volume is the

314
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,720
concentration so you can write that as

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,320
concentration times the volume

316
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,120
okay now

317
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,640
inside this uh

318
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,039
element we have also some um volume

319
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,679
effects for example chemical reactions

320
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,520
that are occurring inside in the

321
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,720
interior

322
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,720
and

323
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,039
therefore uh the proportionality

324
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,880
relations are governed by these uh um

325
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:15,960
Epsilon Epsilon dots which are the the

326
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:19,679
rate of uh advancement of the reaction

327
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,440
coordinate we can write also that as the

328
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,280
volume times a reaction rate per unit

329
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:30,760
volume which which is typically called

330
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,760
R without the DOT

331
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,679
and then the other is the entropy

332
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,880
production due to

333
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,320
irreversibility which

334
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,480
occurs uh throughout the the volume of

335
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,120
that uh of the

336
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,880
system and that to we like to write in

337
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,360
terms of uh per unit volume so we have

338
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,799
Define this Syle s dot rate of entropy

339
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,559
production triple means per unit volume

340
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,960
and soon

341
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,679
uh we have al already started calling

342
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,679
this thing

343
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,840
Sigma all right

344
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,400
so here is the energy

345
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,039
balance it says the rate of change of

346
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,280
the energy of our

347
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,159
system is equal to the

348
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,360
net energy it

349
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:33,760
exchanges through uh the intera

350
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:37,120
actions and here it has interactions uh

351
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,520
on the left and on the right and the net

352
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,679
is the

353
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,039
difference and you have to take it with

354
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:49,640
a minus sign if it goes out so if this

355
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:53,000
one is greater than that one the

356
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,799
difference is is this term

357
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,640
here and that is per unit area and then

358
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,640
you have to multiply by uh the area

359
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,120
and that is it because energy is

360
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,280
conserved let's go to entropy the

361
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,919
entropy balance says the rate of change

362
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,240
of the entropy of our fluid

363
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:23,720
element is equal to the net entropy

364
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,159
flux the

365
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,840
interaction so here I have again left

366
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:35,640
and right the the

367
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:38,000
difference uh is this term here and with

368
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,520
the negative sign because if it is

369
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,400
positive it's you have more entropy

370
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,120
going out than coming

371
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:51,720
in and that's this term

372
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,799
here I think there is a an error here

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,120
because I need also an

374
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,520
area like like here I need to multiply

375
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,440
by a

376
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,440
I need to correct

377
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,559
that that's that doesn't finish the

378
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,720
entropy balance because you also have

379
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:16,440
the ENT to account for the entropy

380
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,440
generation inside the element due to

381
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,159
reversibility okay now what we do is

382
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,279
simply

383
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,520
divide by the

384
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,480
volume Delta

385
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,400
V left and right of these equations and

386
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,400
here is how you what you

387
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,360
get so these are the balance

388
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,200
equations so now I want to

389
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:57,320
open a little uh degression that uh is

390
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:03,640
nevertheless uh

391
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,640
important uh regarding how we um

392
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,880
describe uh the properties of a

393
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:13,000
Continuum in particular the extensive

394
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,159
properties like uh energy

395
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Mass uh

396
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:22,880
entropy and a bunch of others that I'll

397
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,279
I'll have in a summary table so in so

398
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:31,880
let's

399
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:34,520
consider uh like uh we typically do in

400
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,960
in mechanics we

401
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,640
consider a

402
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,279
volume call it Sigma M so it's material

403
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,520
volume so certain I select at a certain

404
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:51,080
instant of time a certain bunch of

405
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,320
particles contained inside this

406
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:59,039
volume and I

407
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:05,760
denote uh the surface of that as uh

408
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,760
uh partial of Sigma m m stands for uh

409
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,880
material of course when uh the fluid

410
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,200
moves

411
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:22,000
uh you need to if you want to follow the

412
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,000
material volume in know this problem is

413
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that uh you need to track all the

414
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,520
particles that are inside here at uh

415
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,080
times say T1 and then at time T2 you

416
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,679
need to see where all those particles

417
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,400
have gone and consider another volume

418
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,400
that contains only those

419
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,840
particles and so this would be the grent

420
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
point of view and uh it's it's

421
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,320
complicated so that's why in fluid

422
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,080
mechanics you introduce control volumes

423
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,480
and all and thean point of but that's

424
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,440
not

425
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,760
uh not going control volumes here they

426
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,679
they do them in FL mechanics but what

427
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:13,679
I'm doing here is just uh uh the balance

428
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,919
equations and in particular I want to uh

429
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,600
obtain from the balance equation written

430
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:24,240
for the material volume the balance

431
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,559
equation written for the infinitesimal

432
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,960
element of that volume so in other words

433
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,840
something uh what we are usually called

434
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,240
the uh

435
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:43,559
indefinite balance equations that are uh

436
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,559
what holds Point by Point uh in in our

437
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,240
Continuum so first of all let's call the

438
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,159
generic property think of energy but

439
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:59,120
then it could be also entropy let's call

440
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,120
it a capital A or even Mass

441
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,399
even

442
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,080
volume and we call it extensive if you

443
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:12,799
can say if there is a if you can if you

444
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,240
can assign to that property a a local

445
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,159
field little

446
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,960
a and field means it's defined at every

447
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:27,039
point in in in Space X is X and Y X Y Z

448
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:30,320
and T is time so this is the the

449
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
field like

450
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,440
density so you want to you are assuming

451
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,399
uh that you can

452
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,399
define density field

453
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:45,960
X density is a function of position and

454
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,279
and

455
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,279
time so

456
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:57,320
that you can write the overall property

457
00:25:52,279 --> 00:26:00,279
for uh the material volume as the uh the

458
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:05,159
sum of contributions for all the parts

459
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:09,159
so in other words uh the integral of

460
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:11,880
that property per unit volume times the

461
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:17,600
volume okay so row times

462
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,600
a is property a per unit

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,200
volume

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,760
okay once you have that as you have seen

465
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,440
in the balance equations for for example

466
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,919
the left hand side of the energy balance

467
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,399
or the entropy balance you need to take

468
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,320
the rate of

469
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,640
change of the energy of your system or

470
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,120
of the entropy of your

471
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,840
system so we need to take the rate of

472
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,840
change d by DT of this

473
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,880
integral to compute the left hand side

474
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:56,559
of the balance

475
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,520
equations and

476
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,520
since the material volume

477
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,120
moves uh you cannot just take uh the

478
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:14,559
derivative inside the integral yes you

479
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,760
can you take that does part of the

480
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,919
contribution but there is another part

481
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,039
which is due to the fact that the limit

482
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,880
of integration namely this surface that

483
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,640
follows the the the particles as they

484
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:32,600
move moves and therefore

485
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,159
you have to write a surface integral so

486
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,520
an integral over the

487
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:42,720
surface of the takes into

488
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,360
account uh for each of these um

489
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,919
surface

490
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:53,960
positions you have to take into account

491
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:58,320
first of all you you assign a a unit uh

492
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:03,320
vector and by convention I usually typic

493
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,320
typically choose positive if

494
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,440
outward and then uh I have to see how uh

495
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:16,760
the molecules on this point of the

496
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:20,559
surface move and that I call the

497
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,559
velocity uh V

498
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:30,120
subm which will we will call soon the

499
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,120
bicentric uh veloc

500
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:41,640
because in fact before I call it visam

501
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,320
it should it simply should be the

502
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,240
velocity assigned to the surface of the

503
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,039
uh material volume and then it turns out

504
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,320
that since the volume is a material

505
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:56,200
volume so it's made of particles uh that

506
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,760
part of the surface moves with the

507
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,720
velocity of the particles that are

508
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,919
there and the velocity of the particles

509
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,919
is

510
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,679
VM so the net so since the

511
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:16,399
velocity uh may have a different

512
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,320
direction as the normal uh to the

513
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,559
surface what brings

514
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:26,840
a uh

515
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:30,640
particles say out of this

516
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,519
volume uh and contribute to that surface

517
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,279
integral or contribute to to changing

518
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,919
the surface integral is only the

519
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,480
component that is in the direction of

520
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,840
the normal so that's why you take the

521
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,360
scalar product of v and N to get the the

522
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,440
normal component that

523
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,640
contributes to moving uh stuff out of

524
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,440
that

525
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,440
U say energy out of that surface

526
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,679
and then you convert by using the

527
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,279
Divergence

528
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,519
Theorem a surface integral of this form

529
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:14,840
something dotted into

530
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:17,240
n uh is equal to the integral of of the

531
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,399
volume the volume integral of the

532
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:26,120
Divergence of whatever is dotted into

533
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:26,120
n and so you get this

534
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:39,039
um so we transformed this rate of change

535
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,360
in an integral in a volume integral of

536
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:47,399
two contributions the partial with

537
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,399
respect to T and the Divergence of row

538
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:58,279
AVM this will be called the

539
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:58,279
convective uh flux in a in in moment

540
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:09,559
because that uh property that is

541
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:12,559
exchanged

542
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,559
uh

543
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:26,080
okay uh okay we talking about property a

544
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:29,080
so property a like um say heat or I mean

545
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,960
energy uh if you have a a heat

546
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,080
interaction uh happening on the surface

547
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,919
of this control

548
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,639
volume so you have

549
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:46,559
say

550
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:46,559
h another Vector here which would be qou

551
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,639
prime

552
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:56,600
that is important in your energy balance

553
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:59,639
because even if it is true that the U

554
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,880
surface for follows the the particles so

555
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,880
the particles don't go

556
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,480
out but if there is heat interaction

557
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,880
between those particles inside your

558
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,679
material volume and those outside then

559
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,639
there is energy transfer between the two

560
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,399
and the energy transfer is represented

561
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,919
by this Vector here and there is also of

562
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:27,080
course

563
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,080
entropy uh transfer

564
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,039
in the same directions if it is a heat

565
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:51,080
interaction so what we Define as a

566
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:55,960
flux because these are fluxes so it's

567
00:32:51,080 --> 00:33:01,480
energy per unit area per unit time

568
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:05,639
energy exchanged per unit area per unit

569
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:12,399
time and we we give that uh the generic

570
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:12,399
symbol J sub a or actually j z sub

571
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,840
a and it's it's

572
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,120
defined this way

573
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,519
and once I have defined that I can also

574
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,519
assign a sort of a velocity

575
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,960
of

576
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,960
transfer of that

577
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,320
quantity so I have flux to which is

578
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,360
assigned the velocity of

579
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:50,840
transfer uh by dividing the flux by the

580
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,039
property per unit volume so if I take Q

581
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,440
double Prime and divided by row

582
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:04,440
U qou Prime divided by row

583
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,720
U that gives me a velocity we could call

584
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,200
that

585
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:13,839
velocity um the

586
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:19,480
transport the heat transport velocity so

587
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:21,760
speak and also you could have q Prime

588
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,480
over T which is the entropy divided by

589
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,040
row

590
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,679
s and that would

591
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:35,560
be um

592
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,560
the transport transport velocity for

593
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:49,320
entropy the transport velocity for

594
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,879
momentum is the bicentric

595
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,679
velocity the velocity that you typically

596
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,240
use in fluid

597
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,400
mechanics I say fluid has a velocity

598
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,320
field d

599
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,960
you

600
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,680
mean this uh velocity or is the mass

601
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,440
transfer

602
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,440
velocity so it's

603
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:22,160
JM which is the the flux of

604
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,160
mass uh divided by

605
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:30,760
row and because row is the uh uh mass

606
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,960
per unit volume and that

607
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,200
is the bicentric that is velocity of

608
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,200
food

609
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,560
mechanics okay

610
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,520
now so this V velocity this flux with

611
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,920
the zero on

612
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:10,880
top is in

613
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,880
terms of a reference

614
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,240
frame yeah okay reference frame that you

615
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,480
have like the laboratory reference frame

616
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,319
with respect to which you measure

617
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,800
velocities of your fluid elements

618
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:30,359
okay however you could also consider a

619
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:35,760
local reference frame to your fluid

620
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,760
element that moves with the velocity

621
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,040
VM so you

622
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,040
move with your fluid

623
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,599
element well actually the fluid

624
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,640
element uh is made up of many particles

625
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,160
so so you have you're not moving with

626
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,839
velocity of one particular particle but

627
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,839
with uh a weighted average of the

628
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,359
Velocity which which is the bicentric

629
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:02,359
velocity of those

630
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,760
particles so relative to that if I take

631
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,079
the the the velocity of

632
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:21,440
transport of this uh property a and

633
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:25,839
I view it from that reference frame so

634
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:29,359
the relative velocity is VA minus

635
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,560
VM so I Define

636
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,560
this

637
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:41,119
flux and

638
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,119
uh we call it the diffusive

639
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,839
flux so it's the flux relative to the

640
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,760
local body Centric

641
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:54,720
velocity this is the most

642
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:58,119
uh uh practically used and what appears

643
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,880
in typically in the balance equation but

644
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,160
also this other one appears so you have

645
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,240
to be careful if you are in this

646
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,960
business and you

647
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,000
see balance

648
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,760
equations

649
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,359
uh you have to be careful whether

650
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,760
because sometimes people don't put the

651
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:22,480
not actually almost never put the the

652
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,760
the distinction they just pick one um

653
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,520
way of of describing plaxis and then

654
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,839
keep going and uh presume that from the

655
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,839
context of the paper you can understand

656
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:38,319
which one which is it which is

657
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:42,040
one now the same concept of of flux

658
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:45,079
applies also as you know to uh vectors

659
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,079
so you can transfer

660
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,560
momentum and so uh the the moment the if

661
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:58,800
you define the diffusive

662
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:02,560
flux where uh the property a is moment M

663
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,319
um actually so little a

664
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,319
is the bicentric

665
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:08,319
velocity

666
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,119
itself

667
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,280
then you obtain uh the diffusion

668
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,520
momentum diffusion

669
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,520
flux which is the negative of the stress

670
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,359
tensor also called the pressure tensor

671
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,599
and typically the stress

672
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,480
tensor is H split into two parts an

673
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,480
isotropic

674
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,880
part

675
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:55,560
with Delta is like like a tensor is one

676
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,319
one one on the diagonal zero diagonal

677
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,319
and uh that

678
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,960
um so the

679
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:05,960
trace of

680
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,880
the PM is the the trace of the stress

681
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,400
tensor oh I'm sorry of the pressure

682
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,560
tensor and divided by three and it is

683
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,920
called the

684
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,720
mechanical

685
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,680
energy which is not

686
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,319
necessarily equal to the thermodynamic

687
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,319
uh uh

688
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,280
pressure okay

689
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,760
so what we instead call convective

690
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,200
flux is the flux of that property which

691
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,760
is

692
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:02,400
transported by the simple translation

693
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:06,920
of the uh transl not translation

694
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:11,839
translation translation transl I don't

695
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,640
know the fact that the fluid element

696
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,240
moves it brings with itself the

697
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,880
properties that it has inside so that

698
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,680
produces a flux move movement of the

699
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,000
property if if there is energy in that

700
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,680
box uh and you move the Box you're

701
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,040
moving energy okay okay so that is

702
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,040
convection convection and it's the

703
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,240
difference uh between uh this and the

704
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,839
diffusive or if you want you can

705
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,520
write uh the flux with respect to the

706
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:56,319
reference

707
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:59,240
frame as a sum of the diffusive plus the

708
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,240
convective

709
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,480
flux

710
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,480
okay so

711
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,440
the the

712
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,680
convective uh

713
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,480
momentum

714
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,680
flux is the fact

715
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,319
that this fluid

716
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,480
element since it's moving it has M

717
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:27,920
momentum and the momentum per unit

718
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,920
volume is Row V

719
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,559
and since it's moving with velocity V

720
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:37,119
you're transporting momentum by simple

721
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:40,200
uh motion so it's not diffusion it's

722
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,760
just uh due to the fact that the thing

723
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,760
is moving and that is convective

724
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,760
momentum transport

725
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,839
now in U inside your material volume

726
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,839
inside that fluid

727
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,800
element there are certain um things that

728
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,359
happen for example per unit volume for

729
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,319
example the entropy produced by

730
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,480
reversibility is locally produced so

731
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,880
it's it's uh it's some something that

732
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,880
when you want to account

733
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,200
it you want to account for it you have

734
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,920
to

735
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,119
um take it multiply by the volume and

736
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,200
then uh

737
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,160
integrate so these are s you can view it

738
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,880
as a source term I mean for the entropy

739
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,640
balance it's a source term it cannot be

740
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,160
a sync because it would violate the

741
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:59,040
principle of entropy non

742
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,040
decrease but uh in other

743
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:10,319
models for example often in heat

744
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:12,720
transfer you you use terms like uh you

745
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,640
add a term to the balance equation you

746
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:20,839
call it triple triple prime Q it's the

747
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:25,319
entropy uh I'm sorry the the the energy

748
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:27,839
um internal energy deposited locally for

749
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:30,920
example by Jewel effect if you have a

750
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,880
a conductor electricity conductor by

751
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,599
jeel effect that

752
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,200
dissipates electrical energy and

753
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,559
transforms it into internal energy so if

754
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,319
you if you make a balance of internal

755
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:49,000
energy you will find a source term and

756
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,880
that Source term is a source per unit uh

757
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,079
volume so it's like a

758
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,079
sigma of

759
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,079
energy and usually you can distinguish

760
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,640
between those that

761
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:04,160
are

762
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,079
uh produced by local effects like the

763
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,520
jewel effect is a local

764
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,280
effect

765
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:17,040
or a

766
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:20,760
collision uh produced effects including

767
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,839
uh chemical reactions that that

768
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,680
essentially uh chemical reactions you

769
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,760
can consider it as a as a as a source of

770
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,680
products of the reaction and the sync

771
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,599
for the uh reactants of the reaction and

772
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,160
and which occurs uh locally in in in

773
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,599
your

774
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:45,359
volume and so this I you would call it

775
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,319
with a superscript i to be distinguished

776
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,720
with the externally generated for

777
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:55,400
example

778
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,920
um uh if uh this fluid element lives in

779
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,920
a gravitational field

780
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:09,680
field G and of course it has

781
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,400
mass so it also has a potential energy

782
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,880
and the fact that it

783
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:19,680
moves makes that potential energy

784
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,800
change and that's not due to a local

785
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,760
effect it's due to an externally applied

786
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:29,119
field the same if you had charges there

787
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,680
and uh uh uh you had an electric field

788
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,960
say an electric field

789
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,960
like like

790
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,599
this and

791
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:47,720
uh and then you move the charges uh

792
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:51,079
those that so the the the electrical

793
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,319
electrostatic energy of your uh fluid

794
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:57,040
element

795
00:46:52,319 --> 00:47:01,839
changes uh and and that gets into this

796
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,920
volume term it's could be up or down so

797
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,920
it could be a sync or a

798
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,200
source so this in principle for various

799
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,400
properties could be positive or

800
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,000
negative it's only for the entropy

801
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,400
production that you know uh precisely

802
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,400
which sign it must

803
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,160
have

804
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,119
okay so finally we've all those

805
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,880
ingredients you can write the balance

806
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,559
equations for this extensive property a

807
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,040
and it says the rate of

808
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,040
change of the

809
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:46,240
property inside your material volume is

810
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:51,079
equal to the amount of proper the

811
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:54,760
amount the contribution of these sync

812
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:57,920
Source terms integrated of course over

813
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,920
the volume

814
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:05,200
H minus the amount that leaves the

815
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,200
volume through the

816
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:14,119
surface and so that amount that leaves

817
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,720
is equal to the the velocity associated

818
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:19,880
with with the flux of that

819
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:27,240
property relative to the

820
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,240
velocity of the surface of your uh

821
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:31,359
of your material

822
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:35,599
volume

823
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,520
okay H

824
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,040
times the property per unit one and also

825
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,480
here you see something multi multiply

826
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,839
dotted into n and integrated over a

827
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:55,040
surface you can use the

828
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:57,799
Divergence Theorem and transform it into

829
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,079
the uh

830
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:02,799
uh

831
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:06,160
Divergence of whatever is uh uh dotted

832
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:10,599
into the uh normal outward normal to the

833
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:13,400
surface and you may recognize here that

834
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:20,200
since this velocity is

835
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:23,520
VM VA minus v a m time row a is uh the

836
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:28,720
diffusive plux we defined it uh in the

837
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,720
previous slide that's why I get that

838
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,319
all right so this

839
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:42,480
is say the the right hand side of the

840
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,480
balance

841
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:52,200
equation and the left hand side we

842
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:57,200
already wrote in a couple of slides

843
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,200
ago we wrote it in this form

844
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,799
okay so this is the general form of a

845
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,280
balance

846
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:06,680
equation for property a for an extensive

847
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,400
property

848
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,559
a I think I'll repeat

849
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,960
it in the next slide because we need to

850
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,960
here it

851
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
is okay

852
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,319
now

853
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,480
since uh that equation balance equation

854
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:31,880
must hold for a

855
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:34,000
uh whatever material volume large small

856
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,839
and so on

857
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,760
arbitrary the only way that these

858
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:43,680
equation can hold for arbitrary volumes

859
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:48,960
is that the arguments of the integrals

860
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:52,880
be equal and therefore you you can cross

861
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,640
away the integrals and keep the equality

862
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,720
between the integrant and that's your

863
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,200
for indefinite balance equation for

864
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,200
property

865
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:15,559
a remember that we said that the

866
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:19,319
diffusive

867
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:23,599
flux is the lran flux minus the

868
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:24,960
convective flux of that property so we

869
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,119
can

870
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,079
uh combine

871
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,079
these two

872
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:36,520
equations and and therefore rewrite it

873
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,040
in either this form or that form so

874
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,640
there are two equivalent ways to write

875
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,640
the balance

876
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:46,839
equation but the important thing is that

877
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,640
in this left hand

878
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:53,839
side you get

879
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:58,000
j0 whereas here you get

880
00:51:53,839 --> 00:52:01,040
J and this combination of uh partial

881
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,319
derivative and the bicentric velocity

882
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,200
times the gradient of property a which

883
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:10,280
comes in when you substitute this into

884
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,880
there uh as you know is called the

885
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,880
material

886
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,720
derivative and it

887
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,640
represents how things change as a

888
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,799
function of time as viewed from the

889
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,480
fluid element by as Mo by moving

890
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:30,000
together with the fluid element at the

891
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,000
bicentric

892
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:37,160
velocity and following therefore the

893
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:39,079
fluid element that's why it it follows

894
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,720
the trajectory that is called the path

895
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,720
line in FL

896
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,640
mechanics

897
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,280
okay so these are the balance equations

898
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,799
we are going

899
00:52:52,280 --> 00:53:01,960
to I think we are going to use uh

900
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:01,960
well either one probably more this

901
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,359
one so if you do that what we have done

902
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,839
for the one dimensional problem if you

903
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:21,480
do it for the three-dimensional uh I

904
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:21,480
mean for the full dimensional

905
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:30,040
stuff uh you can write uh the mass

906
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,040
balance equation in this

907
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,599
way you can write uh the energy

908
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,599
balance in this way in terms of the

909
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:43,559
diffusive FL

910
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,559
flaxes H the entropy

911
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,520
balance but also you can write the

912
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,520
momentum

913
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,599
balance and of course the material

914
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,640
uh actually

915
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:04,760
these two

916
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,760
are U related to one

917
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,240
another because what you would need to

918
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,960
do is to write a balance equation for

919
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:16,839
each kind of particle each type like

920
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:20,680
each I uh and then once you have it you

921
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:23,160
can express it in terms of mole specific

922
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:28,359
or mass specific and so on and you can

923
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,359
write it for example here this symbol

924
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,720
or C is the mass fraction other in other

925
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,160
places actually probably in the next

926
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:41,960
slide um I call that same mass fraction

927
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,960
with the symbol

928
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,440
X so here's the definition of the

929
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,920
bicentric Velocity that we that I

930
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,160
mentioned and here is the expression for

931
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:58,160
the flux of uh the

932
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,160
mass flux

933
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:04,839
in laboratory

934
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,839
frame it's row *

935
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,319
B and it's related to the masses to the

936
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:15,359
velocities of the vales and this

937
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:17,920
table I'm not describing it but simply

938
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,640
is is there it's useful just to mention

939
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,240
how many different ways you have to do

940
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,200
the accounting and depending on what

941
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,720
your application or depending on your

942
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:33,000
community

943
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:35,760
uh people use uh um mole fractions Mass

944
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,400
fractions uh

945
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,720
concentrations and so on and so these

946
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,359
are the inter relations

947
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,960
that uh inter Cur between these

948
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:49,799
various

949
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,599
properties so I leave it there just for

950
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:54,799
reference and also this slide provides a

951
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,799
list

952
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,359
of example

953
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:02,720
the main

954
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,960
examples for those extensive properties

955
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,200
that we have written the balance

956
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,760
equations

957
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:13,000
for and for which we can

958
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:15,960
Define convective fluxes and diffusive

959
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,839
fluxes and so you the number of moles

960
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,760
the total mole

961
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:24,760
and the mass

962
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:28,680
uh of particles of a certain type the

963
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:32,440
total mass the charge of particles of a

964
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:35,440
certain type the total charge the energy

965
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,400
the entropy the kinetic energy the

966
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,000
potential gravitational energy the

967
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:45,000
potential electrical energy and

968
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:48,480
momentum for each one of these you can

969
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,960
write balance equations of the form that

970
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,960
of the generic form that we have uh

971
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,960
discussed

972
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:05,200
okay so that is

973
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:09,200
uh the balance equation now as just a

974
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:13,520
small regression about the fact that we

975
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:16,160
are dealing in in this model so far uh

976
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,760
and all that we have done we are dealing

977
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,720
with the idea of a Continuum the fact

978
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:24,960
that you can assign to and position in

979
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:28,039
space and the time

980
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,240
uh for example

981
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:34,559
density it

982
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:40,880
means uh that you have uh enough

983
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:44,160
um uh uh particles in your uh uh in your

984
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,440
volume so that you can

985
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,440
[Music]

986
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:52,680
uh so that you can assume that all the

987
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:55,520
particles are uh are

988
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,799
um so that you can take the the mass of

989
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,880
the particle and consider it as

990
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:06,400
uniformly spread into the in that

991
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,400
volume and that you can do

992
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:14,599
only of course that is the limit of the

993
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,599
traditional food

994
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:23,400
mechanics and you can do it only if the

995
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:28,359
um the nsen number the nsen number is

996
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:34,039
the ratio between the mean free

997
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:39,880
path mean PR free path is the is the is

998
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:41,559
the the travel distance that on average

999
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,039
particles

1000
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:47,200
uh travel for between one collision and

1001
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,200
the

1002
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,240
next so that is Lambda and the

1003
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:58,839
denominator is l l is the typical size

1004
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,839
of your fluid mechanics uh so it's the

1005
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:03,480
length scale of your mean fluid

1006
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,880
mechanics

1007
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:10,839
problem could be the the boundary layer

1008
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:14,680
uh thickness could be uh the diameter of

1009
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:14,680
your pipe if you are in pipe

1010
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,119
flow

1011
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:24,520
so not

1012
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,720
always the nen this nen

1013
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,760
number is

1014
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:34,039
smaller than one if smaller than much

1015
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:37,240
smaller than one

1016
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:42,240
so typically one would say if it is less

1017
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:45,039
than 1% then you can apply uh the

1018
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:48,000
Continuum hypothesis if it is

1019
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:50,400
not then you have to be careful because

1020
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,640
the results that you are obtaining may

1021
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,440
not correspond to the physical reality

1022
00:59:53,640 --> 01:00:01,799
so you can always do that the the model

1023
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:04,799
but the results are not providing V

1024
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:08,760
valid descriptions of

1025
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:13,799
reality for example this table gives for

1026
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:17,640
air at sea level for dry air at 25 C1

1027
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:17,640
atmosphere the mean free

1028
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:26,960
path it's about uh

1029
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,960
67 nanometers

1030
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:38,319
so this condition uh is is guaranteed

1031
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:41,079
when you see the green so if I have a

1032
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:45,520
device that is uh

1033
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:48,720
large small even pretty small like 70

1034
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,559
microns is pretty

1035
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,240
small

1036
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:57,839
uh you still can apply fluid

1037
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,839
mechanics When It Go when your device

1038
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:05,039
gets smaller see the denominator of the

1039
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:10,520
n and number uh gets smaller so the N

1040
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:13,240
number becomes larger and so for small

1041
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:17,039
devices you cannot

1042
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:19,359
U we cannot uh we cannot use food

1043
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:23,400
mechanics or the Continuum

1044
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:26,839
assumption and uh well even for air if

1045
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,520
you go at the this

1046
01:01:26,839 --> 01:01:32,240
position 100 kilometers altitude is

1047
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:35,680
called the kman line there the

1048
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,559
temperature is is is is minus 80 degrees

1049
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:40,680
C and the and the pressure is hundreds

1050
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,839
of an

1051
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:48,599
atmosphere the meanf free

1052
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:53,640
path is uh about

1053
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:57,039
uh what is it uh 100 times 50 times

1054
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:59,680
uh uh larger

1055
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,680
then at C

1056
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:07,319
Level so

1057
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:10,119
there it's the Lambda that is

1058
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:12,240
high so even for standard

1059
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:16,920
devices for

1060
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:19,680
example a typical problem where uh where

1061
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,160
the nuon number fails and you cannot

1062
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:27,359
apply for the mechanics is in the

1063
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:30,119
boundary uh layer of uh the uh uh space

1064
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:33,599
vehicles that have to come back to to

1065
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:36,920
the atmosphere in the upper layers of uh

1066
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:40,599
of the atmospheres the the the Lambda is

1067
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:46,400
so small

1068
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:47,520
that uh the nuton number is of the order

1069
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,680
say

1070
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:57,559
one uh

1071
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:59,640
even even for relatively uh large

1072
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:02,839
thicknesses and

1073
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:05,720
therefore that was in fact one of the

1074
01:03:02,839 --> 01:03:09,599
problems when they were studying the

1075
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:14,160
re-entry problem of the the space

1076
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,160
shutle and not only also

1077
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:21,359
the the other vehicles that that to

1078
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:23,200
reenter through the

1079
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:26,720
atmosphere

1080
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:27,720
okay so remember that um

1081
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,960
what we are

1082
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:34,000
doing uh refers to a Continuum so there

1083
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:37,000
are limitations to

1084
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,599
this

1085
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,359
uh at the end one of the final lectures

1086
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:46,599
we mention what we need to do uh when

1087
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:46,599
this

1088
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:57,480
fails okay

1089
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,960
now we are in the part that we have to

1090
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,400
in order to assemble the energy balance

1091
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:06,680
entropy balance constituents balance we

1092
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,880
need to use a Gibs relation uh to

1093
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,680
combine

1094
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:14,760
them which which is an assumption of

1095
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:18,400
local equilibrium which goes together

1096
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,400
with the Continuum uh

1097
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,520
assumption so remember you you have the

1098
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:28,160
Gibs

1099
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:31,119
relation with we are talking about large

1100
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,640
uh number of particles so we assume the

1101
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:38,480
oiler relation and also the GS and so

1102
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,480
from the two we get the GS do

1103
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,279
relation okay now here there are a

1104
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:46,880
couple of um okay so that that is the

1105
01:04:45,279 --> 01:04:50,000
the

1106
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:53,200
basics then of course you we

1107
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,119
need to remember what the definitions

1108
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,119
are chemical potentials

1109
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:02,839
um we've seen it so many times the

1110
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:05,520
differential of the chemical

1111
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:07,480
potential if you remember uh when we

1112
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:10,119
started doing mixtures we wrote this

1113
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,119
expression

1114
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,960
here a new way uh that is used often is

1115
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:22,599
this

1116
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:25,079
one U you collect the part of the

1117
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:27,000
differential that is not related to

1118
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:30,720
changes

1119
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,599
temperature and instead of writing it um

1120
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:39,000
all the times explicitly you write it

1121
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,000
as the differential of the part of the

1122
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,839
differential of new that you would that

1123
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,359
would survive if you keep the

1124
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:49,480
temperature constant with this symbol

1125
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:52,880
here so uh it Chang the chemical

1126
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,640
potential by changing the

1127
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:59,240
temperature and uh so the specific I'm

1128
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:01,079
sorry the the the partial entropy

1129
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,880
appears

1130
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:06,440
here

1131
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:09,720
or and you call the rest

1132
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:11,559
is which relates to changing pressure

1133
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:15,799
and composition

1134
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:15,799
you you put it together in

1135
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:23,240
here

1136
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:26,520
then another item that we do because we

1137
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:29,920
are making balances for example of

1138
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:31,480
energy not of internal energy yes you

1139
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,760
could also make a balance over internal

1140
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:37,760
energy but uh usually the meaningful one

1141
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,920
is the energy balance and so in the

1142
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,520
energy

1143
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:47,079
balance we typically use this um uh

1144
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:49,920
bulkow bulk flow like uh expression of

1145
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:52,480
the energy in which we recognize an

1146
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,240
internal energy and then some

1147
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:59,640
mechanical addenda that uh

1148
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,440
bringing the kinetic energy uh the the

1149
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:07,839
gravitational potential energy the

1150
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:11,200
electrostatic uh um potential energy and

1151
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:12,839
U the even the centrifugal potential

1152
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,960
energy with the negative sign that we

1153
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:16,960
have seen when we did the

1154
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:22,960
stratification okay and you remember

1155
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:26,960
that therefore the chemical

1156
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,960
potential gets

1157
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,200
in it's only a part of the expression of

1158
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,960
the partial of the energy with respect

1159
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,880
to the amounts which we have called the

1160
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,839
total potential and there are these

1161
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:40,760
other contributions that need to be uh

1162
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:45,000
taken care

1163
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:46,930
of uh there is some there is some

1164
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,559
fishy uh this

1165
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:51,799
[Music]

1166
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:57,079
DQ

1167
01:07:51,799 --> 01:08:00,319
um this DQ shouldn't be here

1168
01:07:57,079 --> 01:08:03,599
yeah it's from from cut and paste from

1169
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:06,960
this expression where I take this one I

1170
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,960
take the differential

1171
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,760
here and

1172
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,839
then you take the total potential is the

1173
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:20,520
partial of the energy while you keep

1174
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:24,279
fixed the entropy the volume the other

1175
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,239
amounts and then you have to keep fixed

1176
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:31,400
uh for example the ventric velocity the

1177
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:33,400
height in the potential uh the value of

1178
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:38,359
the gravitational I'm sorry of the

1179
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:45,040
electrostatic field uh the angular

1180
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:48,719
Mo speed and the location uh so you you

1181
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:51,000
keep all this fix and and and change

1182
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,199
only the amount of that particular

1183
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,199
constituent in order to get the total

1184
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:56,199
potential

1185
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:03,600
and these last lines are just a summary

1186
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:07,759
of uh the fact that you can write

1187
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:12,319
properties specific properties per mole

1188
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:15,239
per unit Mass with the star or per unit

1189
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:21,159
volume okay for unit volume you could

1190
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:21,159
write it as row U star or also c times

1191
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:29,440
U so this is sort of uh summary of

1192
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:34,640
what's

1193
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:39,279
needed so we have worked so far

1194
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:39,279
using molar specific

1195
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:47,520
properties and the Gibbs DM relation has

1196
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:51,199
been always written this

1197
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,400
way and with this new notation of

1198
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:55,960
the differential of the chemical

1199
01:09:53,400 --> 01:10:00,080
potential at fixed uh

1200
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,080
temperature uh it takes this

1201
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:06,880
form and uh since that

1202
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,600
differential means any changes of the

1203
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,920
property if you change only in the

1204
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,719
property by moving in space at a given

1205
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:19,480
instant of time that

1206
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:21,920
becomes uh you can substitute

1207
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:24,080
essentially the D with the nabla with

1208
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,080
the

1209
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:31,159
gradient so so you have an expression

1210
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:33,280
here that uh comes from the Gibs D and

1211
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:36,920
gives you the gradient in pressure and

1212
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:39,600
how it is related to the gradients in uh

1213
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,600
the chemical

1214
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:48,920
potentials so they're not

1215
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:51,040
independent is just is another phase of

1216
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:54,520
the Gibs phase

1217
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:57,000
rule you may also write it in terms of

1218
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,719
mass specific specific properties and

1219
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,320
I'm not staying too much on this you can

1220
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:06,800
just but I'm staying more on this other

1221
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:10,520
one uh volume specific

1222
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,440
properties because if I write the GBS

1223
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:16,880
relation the oil relation and the Gibs

1224
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,520
relation in terms of uh these volume

1225
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,520
specific

1226
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:28,159
properties what I already said uh is

1227
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,920
that uh you can

1228
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:35,520
show that the

1229
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:39,360
pressure disappears from the uh gives a

1230
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:42,560
relation not that you get rid of it

1231
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:46,560
but in terms of these volume specific

1232
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,280
properties you decouple the the the Gibs

1233
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,400
relation from the Gibs Doom relation and

1234
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,040
you can so um forget about pressure and

1235
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,760
then when when you need it you can use

1236
01:11:54,040 --> 01:12:01,080
the Gibs do and relation as a as

1237
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,199
a as an additional

1238
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:06,159
independent equation that gives you uh

1239
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:10,239
the

1240
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:12,760
pressure so the gradient in pressure is

1241
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:15,440
the weighted sum of the gradients in the

1242
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,880
chemical potentials the the the constant

1243
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,199
temperature

1244
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:23,920
part uh weighted on the concentrations

1245
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:23,920
of the various things

1246
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:36,360
so this gives uh

1247
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:37,880
relation you can it you can write it

1248
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:42,199
this time we are interested in the

1249
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:46,960
change with respect to the time uh

1250
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:49,920
variable while uh keeping sort of the

1251
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,719
position variables of these fields

1252
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:57,080
constant so you say you may substitute

1253
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:57,080
the D with the partial with respect to T

1254
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:05,719
so that gives relation becomes this

1255
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:08,320
one or gives this relation between the

1256
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:11,560
partial properties and as you notice

1257
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:14,120
these are the left hand

1258
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:16,400
sides of the balance equations this is

1259
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,400
the left hand side of the energy balance

1260
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,639
left hand side of the entropy balance

1261
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:24,639
left hand side of the uh constituent

1262
01:13:21,639 --> 01:13:24,639
balance

1263
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:39,440
okay

1264
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:42,239
now we need to

1265
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:47,679
uh

1266
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:47,679
generalize the idea of heat interaction

1267
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:03,280
uh and we do it um in a way similar to

1268
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:08,480
the way we have done the heat

1269
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:10,159
interaction so uh simply here it's a um

1270
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:14,040
drawn in different

1271
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:16,120
way remember we took uh two systems that

1272
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,239
uh are a different

1273
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:20,920
temperature and we allow them to

1274
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:25,560
exchange energy and entropy and then we

1275
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:29,800
run a test um can we ident

1276
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,920
identify part of U that energy that is

1277
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:36,560
transferred between the

1278
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:40,440
two uh as work if yes we don't call it a

1279
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:42,440
heat if no yes that's the condition for

1280
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:45,760
a heat

1281
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:48,480
interaction so in order to analyze this

1282
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,360
problem you run an energy balance an

1283
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:56,080
entropy balance for system a same for

1284
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:58,800
system B same for the uh

1285
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,800
Machinery

1286
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:07,760
here we use the Gibs relation for system

1287
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:07,760
a we use the Gibs relation for system

1288
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,679
B and out comes that the work the

1289
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,400
maximum work so we set the entropy

1290
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:24,320
generation equal to zero the maximum

1291
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:25,520
work you can get is given by the uh the

1292
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,400
Carno coeff

1293
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:33,800
multiplying the energy that is being

1294
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:36,800
transferred and so that says that yes a

1295
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:40,320
a good fraction of that energy can be

1296
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:43,000
recognized as work unless the Carno

1297
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,760
coefficient is equal to zero and that is

1298
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
why we Define heat only when the two

1299
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:52,120
temperatures ta and TB are uh their

1300
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,920
difference vanishes so they're

1301
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:59,239
approaching each other

1302
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:02,280
and also in addition to this

1303
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:05,840
result you remember

1304
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:08,520
that in a set of inequalities that says

1305
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,440
that the entropy

1306
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:14,480
exchanged is bound as an upper bound and

1307
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:16,600
a lower bound related to the initial

1308
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,920
temperatures of the two objects and only

1309
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:23,159
in the limit in which the two

1310
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:26,080
temperatures are equal to one another

1311
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:31,480
that uh range of value

1312
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:34,679
results in a in single definite relation

1313
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:37,080
between the entropy transferred and the

1314
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,080
energy

1315
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,560
transfer which is this

1316
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:49,360
relation

1317
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:52,960
Q or Delta Q because then we call that

1318
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:55,320
heat uh is equal to T times the entropy

1319
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,320
exchanged

1320
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,320
now if

1321
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,320
we

1322
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:08,360
divide uh by the

1323
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:11,560
area of contact between the two uh

1324
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:16,960
objects so a here represents the area

1325
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:19,880
not system a and DT is uh the unit the

1326
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:24,239
amount of time that the interaction

1327
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:27,320
occurred you obtain the flux so you may

1328
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:28,520
rewrite this expression as saying that

1329
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,360
for a heat

1330
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:33,239
interaction the energy flux and the

1331
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,920
entropy flux are related by the

1332
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:39,520
temperature which

1333
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:42,639
is uh which is this this expression

1334
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:45,480
here and actually for this particular

1335
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:48,960
one we could even write Q

1336
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:53,080
Prime the symbol Q Prime for

1337
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:58,679
heat okay now I do the

1338
01:17:53,080 --> 01:18:01,280
same but with with the new um U fact

1339
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:04,719
that the two

1340
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:07,920
systems the two think of them them as as

1341
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:11,560
the adjacent fluid elements that uh for

1342
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,679
which we're making balance so so but in

1343
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,320
general these two systems exchange not

1344
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:20,199
only energy and entropy but

1345
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:23,199
also a given amount of each of the

1346
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:23,199
constituents

1347
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,560
procedure is the same you you have to

1348
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,400
write energy and entropy balances for

1349
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,679
system a for system B and for the uh

1350
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,159
Machinery

1351
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,159
here and you need to use the Gibs

1352
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:43,320
relation for system a and the Gibs

1353
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:43,320
relation for system B

1354
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:04,000
it's a bit improper how I'm doing it

1355
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:06,360
here because the

1356
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,400
pressure uh there should be a pressure

1357
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:16,480
term there if we are not uh using

1358
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,840
um properties per unit volume but anyway

1359
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,840
uh the

1360
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:27,520
idea is uh is still okay and then as a

1361
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:30,040
result of this balance equations you get

1362
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,639
uh this

1363
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:36,480
expression so the question is always the

1364
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:39,520
same can we recognize as part of uh the

1365
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,840
energy that is being exchanged here part

1366
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:46,199
of work well now we have two ways in

1367
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:48,679
which it we

1368
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:51,520
could if the carau coefficient is

1369
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:56,639
different than zero then good fraction

1370
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,639
yes could be work but also

1371
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:03,880
if this other

1372
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:06,560
coefficient uh don't know what the name

1373
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,080
is but if it is different than

1374
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,679
zero

1375
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:14,360
then even the temp if the temperatures

1376
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:17,400
are equal uh you you could have some

1377
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:20,639
work so in order to

1378
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:22,120
have uh to extend the idea of heat

1379
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:24,360
interaction and we are going to call

1380
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:29,800
this new interaction heat and diffusion

1381
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:32,480
inter ction with with the the ENT that

1382
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:33,730
joins them for for lack of better names

1383
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,159
we call it heat and

1384
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:38,440
[Music]

1385
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:42,000
diffusion you

1386
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:43,440
need uh the limit that the temperatures

1387
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,159
be equal but also the chemical

1388
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:49,840
potentials of each of the constituents

1389
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:49,840
of two uh interacting systems be

1390
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:58,600
equal and of course by the same uh

1391
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:00,480
way that we prove that uh inequality you

1392
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:05,239
could prove this inequality here that

1393
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:11,600
the entropy exchanged is G uh limited by

1394
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:11,600
two an upper bound and a lower

1395
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:21,159
bound which in that uh

1396
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:21,159
limit become the same value and in that

1397
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:26,320
limit so for a heat and diffusion

1398
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,760
interaction you have a definite relation

1399
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,719
between the energy that is transferred

1400
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,239
the entropy that is transferred and the

1401
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,239
amounts of constituents that are

1402
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:49,000
transfer and if you divide by DT and the

1403
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:52,960
area the various transfers you get the

1404
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,560
fluxes a transfer per unit area per unit

1405
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,440
time and so this is the

1406
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:03,000
relation that characterizes it's the

1407
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:06,280
equivalent of of Q over t

1408
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,440
uh but you see here that it's a it

1409
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,440
contains also this

1410
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:19,120
part so this is a very important uh

1411
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:22,800
uh new independent uh equation that we

1412
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:26,000
need in order to uh like we needed the Q

1413
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,480
overt in order to combine the energy and

1414
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,480
entropy

1415
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,239
balances here here it is so we start

1416
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,760
from

1417
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:42,719
that the question now

1418
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,480
is I say something fishy with this slide

1419
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:49,080
but in any

1420
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:52,000
case the question is

1421
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:55,679
um I'm

1422
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,520
sorry the question is

1423
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:03,199
can we still

1424
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:05,920
call heat the energy that is transferred

1425
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:09,159
in a heat and diffusion interaction the

1426
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:13,480
answer is no only part of the energy

1427
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:13,480
transferred can be called

1428
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:21,120
heat now how do we identify

1429
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:25,520
that okay remember okay this we start

1430
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:27,920
from this relation between the flues

1431
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,440
that characterizes the Heat and

1432
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,639
diffusion

1433
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,639
interaction the chemical potential

1434
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:35,719
appears in it remember that the chemical

1435
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:38,800
potential can always be

1436
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:42,560
written as the

1437
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,080
partial enthalpy minus t times the

1438
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,440
partial

1439
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,159
entropy for each of the constituents

1440
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,159
this is

1441
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:56,960
General so substitute

1442
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:59,040
that and then take on the left hand side

1443
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,679
the stuff that is not multiplied by T

1444
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,639
and on the right hand side the stuff

1445
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:06,600
that is multiplied by

1446
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:11,239
T so now you have found some a part of

1447
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:11,239
the energy transfer of the energy

1448
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:20,000
flux the total minus this part which is

1449
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:22,480
related to a part of the entropy flux

1450
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,480
via the

1451
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:31,000
temperature so we are going to call that

1452
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:34,239
energy part of the energy flux uh qou

1453
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,080
Prime that is what we call the heat

1454
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:38,080
flux that so we call

1455
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:46,159
heat only the difference between these

1456
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:50,960
and the uh the flux

1457
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:55,159
of uh constituents each multiplied by

1458
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,159
the partial enthalpy

1459
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:00,239
you can think of this term that we are

1460
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,920
subtracting

1461
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:04,320
away

1462
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:07,800
as the

1463
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:13,719
energy that is carried by the particles

1464
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:15,199
that diffuse because JN is the diffusion

1465
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:20,199
of

1466
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:24,920
particles uh of type I this

1467
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:28,679
particles uh diffuse and therefore

1468
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:32,080
uh carry with them like in in their

1469
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:34,040
backpack they have the partial enthalpy

1470
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,880
and the partial entropy they actually

1471
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:38,800
have the partial energy and the

1472
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:41,360
partial entropy

1473
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:45,560
and but in order to

1474
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:49,119
overcome uh the to to to move in a in a

1475
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:51,520
in a pressure field they have to uh

1476
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:54,000
that's why the you get the enalia and

1477
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,280
not the energies like in bul flow you

1478
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
have

1479
01:25:55,280 --> 01:26:01,679
the pulsion work now this is Pion work

1480
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,840
against the partial pressure but it's

1481
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:06,480
still uh something that takes you from

1482
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:10,520
the

1483
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:14,480
energy plus the little the work uh that

1484
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:20,080
is needed to uh overcome the these uh

1485
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:24,080
two the pulsion work the partial pulsion

1486
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:24,080
work okay

1487
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:30,880
so the overall energy

1488
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:32,360
flux is therefore now given by this that

1489
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,840
we will call

1490
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,840
heat plus this

1491
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,360
transported

1492
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:48,520
enthalpy uh due to the flux of particles

1493
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:52,440
and also the entropy flux is given by Q

1494
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:55,280
overt so that's proper of a hea the

1495
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:57,679
characteristic of the heat interaction

1496
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,800
plus the entropy that is carried in the

1497
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:04,520
backpack by these particles that are

1498
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:07,639
diffused so other words so we call by

1499
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,890
calling this Q double Prime essentially

1500
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,600
we

1501
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:13,920
[Music]

1502
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:17,560
are transforming this single equation

1503
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:21,679
into two equations with the Q Prime in

1504
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:21,679
it and so we have these two

1505
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:32,320
sets in H we call it Q

1506
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:34,679
Prime in um in this typical business of

1507
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,840
non equilibrium thermodynamics this is

1508
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:41,840
called the measurable heat flux

1509
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:44,360
particularly introduced by this

1510
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:49,639
famous bible of the subject which is the

1511
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,639
book by the growth and mazour

1512
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:07,199
if the

1513
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,960
particles carry also

1514
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:11,880
charge

1515
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,600
then we do exactly the same so the

1516
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,600
relation that

1517
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:22,639
defines uh

1518
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:25,080
the the Heat and diffusion uh uh

1519
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:27,480
interaction

1520
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:30,040
is like this except that you have to

1521
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:32,800
substitute the chemical potential with

1522
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:34,159
the total potential so it becomes like

1523
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,400
this

1524
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:39,280
one and remember that the total

1525
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:41,080
potential when you have particles uh is

1526
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:44,159
given by this it's the chemical

1527
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:49,040
potential plus uh the electrostatic

1528
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:51,239
potential times the uh charge or the

1529
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:55,719
unit charge of

1530
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:55,719
the of your particles

1531
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,920
so you can write it this way still in

1532
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,960
terms of the chemical potential so now

1533
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,800
you can

1534
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,480
U

1535
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:11,440
uh still use the fact that the chemical

1536
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:13,920
potential is hi minus

1537
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:18,880
TSI and then you can

1538
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:22,080
also remember that uh or

1539
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:24,239
Define if you take the Flux Of of

1540
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:28,800
particles and these particles carry this

1541
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:32,040
much uh charge this flux of charge is

1542
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:35,560
what we call current

1543
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:40,440
density charge current

1544
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:40,440
or electrical charge current

1545
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:48,040
density so take this one or this one and

1546
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:54,080
substitute uh as as before and not

1547
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,520
substitute and move left hand side the

1548
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,600
stuff that is not multiplied by T and on

1549
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:01,360
right hand side stuff that is multiplied

1550
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:06,679
by T then you

1551
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:10,679
recognize um you then you call Define

1552
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:15,080
qou prime the measurable heat flux as

1553
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:15,080
this term here and you get two

1554
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:18,840
equations so now the energy flux is due

1555
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,480
to

1556
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:24,199
heat the energy transported by the

1557
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:26,480
diffusion of particles through the

1558
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:30,400
enthalpy the internal energy plus dep

1559
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:36,080
Pion work and the electrical energy

1560
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:40,000
carried by uh the uh the charge

1561
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:43,719
carriers and for the entropy flux the

1562
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:47,280
same there is no contribution by the

1563
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:54,440
electric charge

1564
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:54,440
current okay so with these ingredients

1565
01:30:55,239 --> 01:31:02,920
yeah we're almost we're out of time but

1566
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,920
um yeah we can

1567
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:14,480
um well yeah one

1568
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:16,480
one let say one one way one thing that

1569
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,320
from which we will start next time is

1570
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:21,280
that uh you can rewrite that expression

1571
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:25,000
that defines

1572
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:28,639
uh the relation between uh energy

1573
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:32,360
entropy and materials

1574
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:35,600
flux u in an entropy form instead of an

1575
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,800
energy form uh in terms of new variables

1576
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,440
like the inverse of the temperature and

1577
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,760
the chemical potential the total

1578
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:44,280
potential divided by the

1579
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:48,760
temperature but let's do that next time

1580
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,760
because we're out of time now
