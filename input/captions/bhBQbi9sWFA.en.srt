1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,680
Okay. So, so today we want to talk a

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,400
little bit more about sequences and how

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,039
sequence connect to

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,640
um to um uh a function being continuous.

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,760
And then the second thing we will talk

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,279
about is metric spaces.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,279
So let me just remind you first

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:45,360
uh that if you take a subset here say of

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:51,879
r and you have a function on a into r

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,879
then uh f is set to be continuous.

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,520
Uh if for all x0

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,640
in a

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,640
uh uh um the function is continuous

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,000
is continuous

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,880
at x0 and and it is the function is

16
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
continuous.

17
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,920
is continuous

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,119
uh at x0.

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:53,240
If um for all

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,240
if for all

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,479
epsilon greater than zero there exist

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,479
delta greater than zero such that

23
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,920
if the

24
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:19,760
two points so x0 and this other point X

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,440
they deviate at most by delta

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,440
then their images deviate at most by

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,440
epsilon

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,760
and in general right this delta here

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,599
depends not only on x0 but also on on

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,319
epsilon. So delta would in general be

31
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,920
expected to depend on both of these

32
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,920
things.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,879
Okay, so this is what so we talked about

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,160
this a number of times and we will also

35
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,239
generalize this later in the lecture. So

36
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,400
this is what it means to be continuous

37
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,040
that it needs to be continuous at all

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,360
points and this is what it means need

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,360
what it means to be continuous at a

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,400
point.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,239
Now, two things we talked about before

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,239
is the extreme value theorem

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,519
and the intermediate value.

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,519
And I want to think about these two

45
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,319
theorems in terms of sequences.

46
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,080
And so this is and and and that's often

47
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,319
a really useful way of thinking about

48
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,200
it.

49
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200
So the extreme value theorem is that we

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,360
have a function. So the extreme value

51
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,120
theorem

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,440
abbreviated like this. Um that's the

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,239
theorem that say that if you take a

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,840
function on some interval from a to b a

55
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:09,239
and b are both included

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,239
into r and this function is continuous

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,320
then the claim is that then there exist

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,479
then they exist.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,720
So one way I formulated it is that then

60
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,720
there exist

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,919
x m capital m this is something in that

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:40,080
interval. So there exist some point that

63
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:43,440
we call x capital m and and x little m

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,759
also in the interval.

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,600
And the first one has a property that

66
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,639
for all

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,639
for all

68
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,639
x in x in the interval

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,639
you have that f ofx

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,720
is less or equal to the value

71
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:10,800
at xm. So you have this and you also

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:16,240
have that f ofx at this here is bigger

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:19,280
equal to the value at this other point.

74
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,360
Right? So this means in particular that

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,199
the maximum and the minimum is achieved.

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
It also means that the function is

77
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,360
actually bounded on that interval. So

78
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,360
that's a extreme value theorem

79
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,919
and we talked about that before but I

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
want to think about it in terms of

81
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,320
sequences. So and the other thing I want

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,680
to think about in terms of sequences is

83
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,000
the inter the uh intermediate value

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,280
theorem.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,840
So the intermediate values theorem say

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,479
that um that all values let me just

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,800
formulate it loosely

88
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,800
all values

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,280
between

90
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,800
so sorry uh f here is as above. So f is

91
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,300
again

92
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
so you have again a function

93
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,759
[Applause]

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,560
from there into r like this into r and

95
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,560
this is is continuous.

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,120
So you have this continuous function

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,600
and then the intermediate value theorem.

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,600
So a loosely formulated is say that all

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
values

100
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,919
between

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,160
f of a

102
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,400
and f of b

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,400
are achieved.

104
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,400
So this means that if you take a

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,520
function so you have a function it's

106
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,240
it's this here is the value at the end

107
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,199
point this here is here you have the

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,199
value in the beginning then it's say

109
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:14,000
that everything in between these two

110
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,240
these here is the image of something

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
right that's what the inter uh the

112
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,840
intermediate I'm

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Okay. And I want to prove these two

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,960
using uh sequences.

115
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,080
And so in order to do that and we need

116
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,160
the following lema which is which is

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,000
often

118
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
so again this here is like the

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,919
definition of being continuous right but

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,240
often you uh often when you're proving

121
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,280
that something is continuous you would

122
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,080
instead use this lema here.

123
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,280
So if it's really an if and only if

124
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:58,520
statement but I will just uh prove the

125
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,520
if statement. So if f is continuous.

126
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,720
So the it's only the if statement I need

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,280
in this case here. But in other cases

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,840
you it would it's useful to have the if

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,680
and only if statement. So if f is

130
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
continuous

131
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,599
uh and

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,599
xn so it's continuous

133
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,599
um

134
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:32,240
it's continuous let me just say where

135
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:37,760
the function is defined so in this case

136
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,640
it's just defined on some subset of r.

137
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,640
If this is continuous

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:55,440
and xn is a sequence in a and xn

139
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:59,440
converge to x and x is also in a

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,920
then then the claim is that then

141
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
this sequence here

142
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,839
converge

143
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,519
to to this

144
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,240
And sometimes remember that

145
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,600
if this here is the case then we write

146
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,600
this here as x is the limit of xn as n

147
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,480
go to infinity.

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,360
This statement here can be written as

149
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,959
that f ofx is the limit as n goes to

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,920
infinity

151
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,800
of um of of this thing here.

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,399
And so if you combine these two things,

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,320
if you fill in x is equal to that, then

154
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,560
this here can also be written as that f

155
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,880
of the limit

156
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,160
of x n as n goes to infinity.

157
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,880
This is this right filling in this and

158
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,240
then equal to the limit. So in a way

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,160
if you want to think about it

160
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,959
like it's something about that if it's

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,600
continuous you can exchange the order of

162
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,519
taking limits right okay so but but you

163
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
yeah but that's like a more formal way

164
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,399
in a way but I I always just think about

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,920
like this

166
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,320
okay so we want to prove this lema and

167
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,530
so then we want to use this lema to

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,839
prove these two theorems

169
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:34,160
[Applause]

170
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,040
Okay. So now

171
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,040
let's prove this lema.

172
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,240
So uh so I want to show that that this

173
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,240
so I want to show so we want to show

174
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:59,200
that f of xn converts to f ofx.

175
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,200
So I'm first going to use that f. So use

176
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
first

177
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,880
that uh f is continuous

178
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:22,240
at this point x. So this is some point

179
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,720
in a. So this means that given epsilon

180
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,720
therefore given

181
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,160
given epsilon greater than zero there

182
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
exist

183
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,560
delta greater than zero

184
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
such that

185
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,959
if

186
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,720
x minus

187
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:52,800
uh so any other element y

188
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,680
if this thing here is less than delta

189
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,680
then their images

190
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,399
deviate at most epsilon right this is

191
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,720
just using the definition that x here x

192
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,959
here is now thought about as being some

193
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,480
fixed point right a fixed point and then

194
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,279
y is like any other point right okay so

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,720
we have that

196
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,720
but then we second we use

197
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,680
second use

198
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,800
that the sequence xn converts to x. So

199
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,600
this means that now thinking about this

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,200
delta here that this epsilon is spitting

201
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,839
out. So this means that uh for this

202
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,839
delta for delta there exist

203
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,680
capital n. So that such that if

204
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,920
little n is bigger than the capital n

205
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,320
then actually x n

206
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,040
minus x

207
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,959
is smaller than delta

208
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,760
right

209
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,560
but you see that so now combining this

210
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,560
so combining this

211
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
uh

212
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,320
So maybe I'll go over here. So combining

213
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,320
this

214
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,959
uh combining this then we get that if n

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,760
here is bigger than capital n then x n

216
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:46,959
minus x is smaller than delta.

217
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,040
But this means that now if if they are

218
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,240
smaller than delta then the first part

219
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,320
say that their images so this means that

220
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:00,000
f of xn minus f ofx

221
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,880
is smaller than epsilon right and that's

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,279
exactly what we wanted to prove to show

223
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,240
that this that if you are sufficiently

224
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,720
far out then these two things are very

225
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,360
close together right so that was quite

226
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,240
easy right

227
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,040
Now I want to use this but this is like

228
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,160
you know like you use this sort of thing

229
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,120
to you know for continuity this is like

230
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,480
a standard thing to use it's kind of

231
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,720
used implicitly and again there's this

232
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,240
one has a converse and the converse is

233
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,639
also very useful.

234
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,040
So now let's come back to the extreme

235
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,040
value theorem and the intermediate value

236
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
theorem.

237
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,959
So now let's try to prove. So using the

238
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,959
lema.

239
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,959
So, so, so using the lema

240
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,040
the lema

241
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,880
uh we'll prove

242
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,199
we'll show

243
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,199
the extreme value theorem

244
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,720
uh and the intermediate value theorem.

245
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,120
Okay.

246
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,160
And so now first to prove the extreme

247
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,160
value theorem. So prove

248
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
of the extreme value.

249
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm first going to prove that the image

250
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,000
so first show

251
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:50,440
that the image of this interval here

252
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,440
is bounded.

253
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,040
Okay. So this is what I first want to

254
00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:00,040
show and so I suppose not. So suppose

255
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,040
not

256
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,199
this means that um that um if I for each

257
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,199
n

258
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,720
for each n which is a integer

259
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,959
let's say that it's not bounded from

260
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,959
above right to show that it's not

261
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,199
bounded from below is similar. So I'm

262
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,360
just going to prove that is is bounded

263
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,079
from above

264
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,079
but but the proof

265
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,759
that it is uh bounded from below is is

266
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,920
similar with obvious modifications.

267
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,720
So suppose it's not bounded from below

268
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:46,199
above then for each integer there exist

269
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,199
there must exist

270
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,480
x

271
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,839
in this interval

272
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,839
so that such that

273
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,839
f ofx

274
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,600
is bigger equal to n right because

275
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:07,039
otherwise n would have been an upper

276
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:11,199
bound right and so I can So I just pick

277
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:14,480
such a n. So pick

278
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,720
such n x

279
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,240
and and let's call it xn. Right? So for

280
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:27,199
each n you now have xn and it has a

281
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,799
property that f of xn is bigger equal to

282
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,799
n.

283
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,799
Okay.

284
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,440
Now you have that that this gives you a

285
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,960
sequence. So you have that xn here is a

286
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,120
sequence. It's a sequence

287
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,960
in sorry it's not in this interval here.

288
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,520
But this means that it's so it's a

289
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,520
bounded sequence. It's a bounded

290
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,520
sequence.

291
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,840
So that by the vias

292
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
theorem

293
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,160
theorem.

294
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,799
So by the bolano vasium

295
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,679
um it has

296
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,679
a convergent subsequent

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,280
X and K right so you have that X and K

298
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,120
so this is this sequence subsequence

299
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,240
and it converts to some X right but this

300
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,360
means that but now this means that there

301
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,880
are by the lema over there you have that

302
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,880
this sequence this sequence then because

303
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,440
the function was continuous converts to

304
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:05,080
this right but on the other hand this

305
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,080
here x n k is a subsequence

306
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,240
of xn but this means that this number

307
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,440
here remember that a subsequence just

308
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,200
means that this here I mean it means in

309
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,720
particular that this here would be

310
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:27,120
further out than n. So, so you have that

311
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,840
f of x n k is supposed to be bigger

312
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,919
equal to n k but this is supposed to be

313
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,120
bigger than n

314
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,080
right? So, so these guys here, this here

315
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,400
goes to these here goes to, you know,

316
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,000
these here are are unbounded, right? But

317
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,760
this on the other hand, we're saying

318
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,720
that this sequence converts to this

319
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,039
sequence. So any convergence sequence is

320
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,039
bounded. So that's a contradiction,

321
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,039
right?

322
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,039
Okay. So that's that's so this is like

323
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,679
proving first using the lema we have now

324
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,240
that the image here is bounded from

325
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,000
above

326
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,320
the almost exact same proof with obvious

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,200
modification give that is bounded from

328
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,080
below. So now you have that the image of

329
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,480
this is actually bounded from both above

330
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,919
and below.

331
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,080
And and now

332
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,600
so now

333
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,960
um so now this means that if you're

334
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,960
looking at the image here

335
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,799
you uh this here is a bounded subset. So

336
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,799
this is is a bounded substance

337
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,240
and so you can look at the soup

338
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,240
of this set.

339
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,880
You can look at the soup of the set.

340
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,559
And I'm going to take the soup. I'm

341
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,559
going to call this capital M.

342
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,679
And now for each

343
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:22,679
for each

344
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,679
little n the n is an integer.

345
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,679
Then I can look at m minus 1 / n. Right?

346
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,400
So this is obviously strictly smaller

347
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,720
than capital m. So it's not an upper

348
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,960
bound. Right? So this means that for

349
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,360
little n this here is not an upper bound

350
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:49,120
for this set. So this means that there

351
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:52,520
must exist a x. So so that you have this

352
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,520
for some

353
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,080
x in this interval here.

354
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,559
Right? Because this here is not an upper

355
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,120
bound. This means that there must be

356
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,919
something larger than that. Right?

357
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,880
And now so you just pick for each little

358
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:17,039
n you just pick such a x and we call

359
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,880
this xn. So we have that so xn is in the

360
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,840
interval

361
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:27,760
and we have that m -1 / little n is

362
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,720
strictly less than f of xn.

363
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,200
Remember that this thing here is of

364
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,720
course obviously less than the soup over

365
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,720
all images. So you even have that.

366
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:46,039
Okay. Now, but now you see that now you

367
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,039
have a sequence here.

368
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:55,280
So now you have a sequence

369
00:22:50,559 --> 00:23:00,000
and so you have a sequence XN

370
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:03,400
and so by the bulani. So by the bosani

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,400
by the person

372
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,799
why

373
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,080
um this sequence here

374
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,080
has a convergent subsequence.

375
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,919
Right? This is because this is a

376
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,240
sequence. The xn lie in this bounded

377
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
interval. So it's a bounded sequence,

378
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,480
right? So it has a convergent

379
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,360
subsequence and this convergence

380
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,720
subsequence I call xn

381
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,240
k like that. So this is converging to

382
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:50,080
some something

383
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,360
and that something I'm going to call xm.

384
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,919
Right? Okay. and I then will prove that

385
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,000
this has the property that I wanted.

386
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,360
Okay.

387
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,320
So I have that and so I have because f

388
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,320
was continuous then I have that the

389
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,760
images

390
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,960
converge to the image of this

391
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,960
right this is by continuity

392
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,880
of f right and the and by the continuity

393
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,360
of f and the little lema we proved

394
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,520
before mine

395
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:35,200
so So you have that but now we have you

396
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,520
see that this here tells us this here

397
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,360
right we have this inequality here but

398
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,279
this is just saying that as as n go to

399
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,080
infinity

400
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:53,600
this sequence here converge to m right

401
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:56,240
so we also have that this sequence here

402
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
converts to m this is just because it's

403
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,760
squeezed

404
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,480
It's squeezed here in this interval and

405
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,400
this here is going this lower bound is

406
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,360
going to the upper bound. Right?

407
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,480
But but so if you have that this here is

408
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
converging then any subsequence would

409
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,520
also converge to the same thing. Right?

410
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:22,480
So this imply that for the sub this here

411
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,840
that is a subsequence of these but this

412
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,559
is then converging to the same thing.

413
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,120
So now you see that we have that this is

414
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,760
converging to that but it's also

415
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:39,240
converging to this by uniqueness of

416
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,240
limits we have by uniqueness of limits.

417
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:56,480
Then we have that f of x m is equal to

418
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,960
this right and and capital m again was

419
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
the soup. So this means that the soup is

420
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,600
actually achieved. You found a point

421
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,360
where the soup was achieved right. Okay.

422
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,679
So that proves the extreme value

423
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,440
theorem. It proves by one of the two

424
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,520
parts of the extreme value theorem. It

425
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,760
proved that the soup was achieved and

426
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,799
the proof that the inf is achieved is is

427
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,880
is almost identical with some obvious

428
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,880
changes.

429
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,919
Now for the intermediate value theorem,

430
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,360
so let's try to prove that. So how do we

431
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,360
prove the intermediate value theorem?

432
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,799
and so

433
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,799
so proof of intermediate values

434
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,039
and I'm going to prove but it's not

435
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,720
really I mean it is it's uh the general

436
00:26:53,039 --> 00:27:00,520
case follow uh easily from this so I'm

437
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,520
going to make an assumption

438
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,360
I'm going to assume that the value at A

439
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,520
is strictly less than zero and the value

440
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,400
of B is strictly bigger than zero.

441
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,360
And then I want to show that zero is

442
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,120
achieved as the image of something.

443
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,039
Right?

444
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,480
You can say that sounds like a special

445
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:34,799
case. It is a special case. But once you

446
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,840
can prove this, it's easy to uh get this

447
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,480
the general case. You can either get it

448
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,480
directly from this by modifying the

449
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,200
function by or you can once you see how

450
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,840
the proof of this go then it's easy to

451
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,480
to prove it to set up the you know what

452
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,600
are the different possible cases right

453
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,960
and then prove the them using the same

454
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,480
sort of argument as we do here.

455
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,200
Okay. So, so this is what I'm going to

456
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,200
show want to show

457
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,640
that there exist

458
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,919
x between a and b

459
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,520
such that f ofx

460
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,760
is equal to uh zero. So this is what we

461
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,480
want to show.

462
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,000
Now

463
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,559
and again of of course the function f is

464
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,559
obviously continuous.

465
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,559
So now

466
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:58,480
okay so now let me define

467
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,919
a inter set. It's actually an interval.

468
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:09,200
So I define E here

469
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:11,840
to be the sets of uh of X

470
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,480
between

471
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,120
uh let's call this here. So I want to

472
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,760
show that exists some

473
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,960
um X let's call it X0 just to have

474
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,120
something to refer to just it's I call

475
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,440
it X0 because the value is going to be

476
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:34,080
zero.

477
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:38,320
So I define a set a a x e sorry e and

478
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:44,640
this is the x in the interval but I'm

479
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:49,600
now requiring that that f of y

480
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,600
is lesser equal to zero for all

481
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,600
y

482
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:01,360
for all y which is between A and X.

483
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay.

484
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,640
Now E here is not empty.

485
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,200
E is not empty. E here is not the empty

486
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:17,279
set. Why?

487
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:22,320
Because actually a here this is since

488
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:25,279
A here is in E. Why? Because if you take

489
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,080
a then the value is actually strictly

490
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,960
less than zero right

491
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:36,960
and and and everything that lies in here

492
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,279
but lies to the left of a well that's

493
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,159
only a right so this is kind of trivial

494
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:49,440
statement so this is not zero

495
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:51,360
so now you can take the soup of this

496
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,880
right so maybe I should make one more

497
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,039
remark

498
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:01,840
that of course not only is it not the

499
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:04,399
triv the empty set but E here is bounded

500
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,360
so the soup

501
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:12,640
of E is less or equal to B right because

502
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,440
E all of the elements in E are in this

503
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,520
set so they're trivally bounded by B

504
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,240
right

505
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,399
so I now can look at the soup so the

506
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,679
soup soup here is is a nice number

507
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,679
and I can look at the soup

508
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,080
and I claim so the claim here is

509
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:45,919
that uh that so claim that if set

510
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
or maybe maybe let me just first say set

511
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:54,159
x0 equal to that soup

512
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,440
V and then the claim is

513
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:02,200
that f of x0

514
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,200
is actually zero. Okay.

515
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,159
And so

516
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,159
now you see that

517
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,039
If you take

518
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:28,919
um

519
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,919
right. So now take uh look at the soup.

520
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,679
So like so so for each

521
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,880
for each n

522
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,519
say integer

523
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,120
if you're looking at x0

524
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:53,039
minus

525
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:56,960
1 / n right this is not the soup of e so

526
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,760
this means that there exist an element

527
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,480
uh that is there exist an element For

528
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,440
for each n there exist an element which

529
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,640
are called xn

530
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:16,519
and this xn here and it's larger than

531
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,519
this and the xn is in in e

532
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,480
right

533
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:33,120
but you see that that's for it to be an

534
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,360
E then in fact this element has to be

535
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,519
the value has to be less or equal to

536
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:43,440
zero. So f of xn

537
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,480
has to be lesser equal to zero

538
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:52,440
right because since it's an e right so

539
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,440
since it's in e then we have that right

540
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:03,039
but now of course the xns

541
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,080
the xns they converge this it's bigger

542
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,599
than this but they're less than right

543
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:13,599
the soup of all such guys. Right? So

544
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:18,079
this means that the xn so the xn

545
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:22,560
converge to x0

546
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:26,839
and so this means that f of xn

547
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,839
converge to f of x0

548
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,359
right now

549
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,679
this means that this here is so and

550
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,760
these here are all non negative numbers.

551
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,159
This means that this number here must be

552
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,960
non- negative,

553
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,440
right?

554
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:52,119
If it's actually zero, then that's what

555
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,119
we wanted, right? So, so we're done.

556
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,560
If f ofx0

557
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,560
is actually zero. So we will assume so

558
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,560
assume

559
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,320
that f of x0

560
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,040
is then strictly less than zero.

561
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,440
Right?

562
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,320
But if the value here is strictly less

563
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,560
than zero.

564
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,240
If the value is strictly if this is the

565
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:28,160
case then there exist then if you take

566
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,720
so if you take so here you have here you

567
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:37,960
have um here you have zero

568
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,960
here you have f of x0.

569
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,240
You can then take a little interval

570
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,240
around it.

571
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,400
And now so now take so take

572
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,400
uh take epsilon

573
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,480
bigger than zero.

574
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,040
So that uh such that

575
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,240
if um

576
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,960
uh by such that um this thing here such

577
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,720
that f of x0

578
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,720
plus epsilon this is still negative

579
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,720
right

580
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,599
so now I'm looking at

581
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:27,920
so I'm going to look at so here I have f

582
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,960
of x0 zero this is actually negative

583
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,599
and I'm taking a interval around it so

584
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,440
this is like a interval here we have f

585
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,960
of x0 plus epsilon and here we have f of

586
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,599
x0

587
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:47,520
minus epsilon right so I'm looking at

588
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:52,560
this little interval here around f of x0

589
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,720
and here I have here I have x0

590
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,040
but now I I know that there is because

591
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,440
the function is continuous. I know that

592
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,760
there exist an interval. So there exists

593
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,760
some delta. There exist delta

594
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,839
delta bigger than zero. So that if I'm

595
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,079
in this little interval, this is the

596
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,760
interval from x0 minus delta x0 plus

597
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,280
delta.

598
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,280
If I'm looking at this little integ

599
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:35,119
right so I have in other words I have

600
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:38,240
that if x minus x0 is less than delta

601
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,280
then uh f of x

602
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,520
minus f of x0

603
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,560
is less than epsilon. But everything

604
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,880
that is in this interim here is still

605
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,640
strictly negative. So this means that in

606
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,359
fact I have that f ofx

607
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,560
uh is actually in particular this

608
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,800
implied that such a f ofx is actually

609
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,520
negative right

610
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,240
and so now you see that that so now I

611
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,560
want to get a contradiction

612
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:18,359
because I know so I have now so now I

613
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,359
have this picture Here

614
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:30,240
I have my I have my X0 here. The X0 was

615
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,880
supposed to be the the soup of the set

616
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
A,

617
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,160
right?

618
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,760
And then I know that so I know that

619
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,040
actually

620
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,800
on a little interval around this Xure

621
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,160
everything is T the if I take anything

622
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,520
in a little interval around this x0 then

623
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,880
the values of f under is are actually

624
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:01,280
negative right

625
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,160
but you see that this x0 was was limits

626
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,640
of points where

627
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,240
everything to the left was was

628
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,040
non-positive

629
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,359
but so it means that everything to the

630
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,839
left was nonpositive

631
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:20,160
but then even a little bit further was

632
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,400
still non positive, right?

633
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,440
But then it wasn't like the soup, right?

634
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,359
Because you could actually any here

635
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,480
would be larger and it still would have

636
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:34,960
the property that everything to the left

637
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,960
was was uh under f was non negative.

638
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Okay,

639
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,400
so that's like the proof of the extreme

640
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,760
value theorem and intermediate value

641
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,800
theorem using this using sequences and

642
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,520
using that little lema from before.

643
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,640
Okay. So now the next thing I want to

644
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,359
talk about is another really important

645
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,160
concept and that's a generalization to

646
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,560
some extent it's a generalization of

647
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,079
things we know from the real numbers.

648
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,480
Um

649
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,480
and so this is this concept of a metric

650
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,480
space

651
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,640
and so let me just give you a definition

652
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,960
and then I'll give you a bunch of

653
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,200
examples.

654
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,440
So a metric space it's a set X. So this

655
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,480
is the set

656
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:36,240
and then it's a map

657
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,160
for each pair of points.

658
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:44,079
So let me explain what this what I mean

659
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:51,200
by this. So whenever you have x in in x

660
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:52,800
and and another element in this space

661
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,319
then

662
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:00,000
when you have any such pair then d x

663
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:04,400
comma y this is should be this gives you

664
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,640
a real number. Okay

665
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,560
and so this here is what you usually

666
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,560
call the distance

667
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,599
between

668
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,480
X and Y.

669
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,760
Okay, that's the distance between X and

670
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,920
Y. Now, what property should this have?

671
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:32,319
It's just it's not just any any map from

672
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:37,200
the space the space cross itself into R.

673
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:40,160
It has three properties. The first is

674
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,200
that the distance

675
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,440
between parent points

676
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,359
I mean and then there are generalization

677
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,119
of this but but anyway so I'll talk

678
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,280
about it that's generalization like if

679
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,680
you're working with like general

680
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,000
relativity then you would actually not

681
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,839
quite work with this definition you work

682
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,560
with some generalization of this but so

683
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,359
what property should this distance have

684
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,400
it should have three properties

685
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,960
The first is that for any x and y

686
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,720
the distance between any two points

687
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,280
should always give you a non- negative

688
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,880
number. Right? So this here should be

689
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,920
non- negative. And

690
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,599
if the distance between two points is

691
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,760
zero then

692
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:35,200
those two points should be the same.

693
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,680
So in fact the distance here is equal to

694
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,920
zero if and only if x is equal to y.

695
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,599
Okay.

696
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,640
So that's the first property.

697
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,200
And the second property is

698
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,760
so just that distances are non- negative

699
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,079
if you will. The second property is that

700
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,520
if you looking at what is the distance

701
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,359
from X to Y, the distance from X to Y

702
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:06,160
should be the same as the distance from

703
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:08,160
Y to X. So this is

704
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,720
so this is this and this is sometimes

705
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,040
referred to that is symmetric.

706
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,240
It doesn't matter whether you first you

707
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,720
begin at X and go to Y or you begin at Y

708
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,280
and go to X.

709
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,160
And then the third thing which is kind

710
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,319
of like the non-trivial part of it and

711
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,280
the thing that makes it really useful

712
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,720
which is called the triangle inequality

713
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,000
that if you have three points X Y and Z

714
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:42,560
in this space and you're looking at the

715
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:45,040
distance from X to C.

716
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,640
So if you imagine that you take you have

717
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:54,400
three points X Y and then you have

718
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:58,160
another point C sorry no it's not so X

719
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,760
you have three point X Y and Z but you

720
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,200
think about that you're looking at the

721
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,440
distance from X to C.

722
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,280
Well instead of going kind of directly

723
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,760
from X to C. If you went over y then

724
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,400
this distance here should be longer than

725
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,040
if you went directly. So this thing here

726
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,680
should be less or equal to the distance

727
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:25,359
from x to y plus the distance from y to

728
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,520
c. And this here is like the non-trivial

729
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,560
part of it.

730
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,560
And this is called the triangular.

731
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,520
Now what are some examples of this? And

732
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,520
then let's look at a bunch of examples.

733
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,880
The first example is

734
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,880
the first example is just

735
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,240
is just where x is r

736
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:12,240
and so you have two points in x in r and

737
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,480
now the distance between them is simply

738
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,160
x minus one

739
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,400
right this is obviously non- negative if

740
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,319
It's zero that means that x is equal to

741
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,000
y. It's obviously also symmetric. And

742
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,680
the triangle inequality is this

743
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,240
inequality that we're using all the

744
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,240
time. Right?

745
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,800
Another example

746
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,800
uh is uh if you're looking at where x

747
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:46,319
here is r squ say and then you're

748
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,160
looking at you're thinking about x and y

749
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,760
you may think about it as vector or

750
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,560
whatever you want to think about it. So

751
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,440
this means that X here has coordinates

752
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,079
X1 and X2

753
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,200
and Y has coordinates

754
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,200
Y1 and Y2.

755
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,520
And now the distance between these two

756
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,520
points

757
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:17,040
is just the square root

758
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:22,079
of x1 - y1

759
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:24,400
squared plus x2 -

760
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,280
uh y2

761
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,720
squared. That's the distance. And this

762
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:33,720
here is often referred to as a uking

763
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,720
distance.

764
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,680
Right. So this is this distance that you

765
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,359
know this is like the distance is given

766
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,319
by pagas here. Right. And so that is so

767
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:49,440
it's clear the first two property but

768
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:51,359
those are always clear and the triangle

769
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,760
inequality that's the one that sometimes

770
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,680
is tricky to prove.

771
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,280
Okay. So that's another example of a

772
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,440
distance.

773
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,680
I want to give you a few more examples.

774
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:08,079
Uh and so another example is like where

775
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,560
you do this in R3 and so you have

776
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,040
instead of points having two coordinates

777
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,280
they now have three coordinates and you

778
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,359
do the same sort of thing but now there

779
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,400
would be a third term in under the

780
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,640
square root sign which be the square of

781
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,000
the difference between the third

782
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:29,599
coordinates. Right?

783
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,560
Okay. Uh then

784
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,119
then let me give you a few more

785
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:39,599
examples.

786
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:43,280
Uh there's a one that is to some extent

787
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:46,319
simpler than this one here

788
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,839
and it's sometimes useful but it's not

789
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,640
as

790
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,480
useful as the

791
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,040
as the

792
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,920
ukian distances.

793
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,160
And again these sort of things are

794
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,079
generalized there are you know example

795
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,160
of something much more general like this

796
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,119
here is what's called a helper space

797
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,280
example of a helper space the next is

798
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,359
some something which is example of

799
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,400
something called a bar space but so the

800
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:18,680
next example I will look at is what is

801
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,680
sometimes called the box distance

802
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:29,119
and so if space in this case is is R2.

803
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,280
I mean you could do it in R3 also if you

804
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,680
wanted and you take two points here X

805
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,240
and Y

806
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:44,480
in R2 and so so X this here underline X

807
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:49,200
has coordinates X1 and X2 and now the

808
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:52,960
distance between these two points

809
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,599
would be uh would be you didn't do this

810
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,760
fancy thing with square root but you did

811
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,960
the more trivial thing where you're just

812
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:06,079
adding right so you're taking two points

813
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:09,359
here in R2 this is maybe x1 comma x2

814
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:13,520
this is y1

815
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:16,480
y1 comma y2 the ukian distance is simply

816
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,240
this distance here the box distance is

817
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,440
where you take this distance here and

818
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:29,280
you add in this distance here so this is

819
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:32,240
this here plus uh x2 2 minus Y2.

820
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,079
That's a box distance. And obviously

821
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,720
this is a non- negative. It gives you

822
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,440
for any pair. It's non- negative. It's

823
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,839
obviously symmetric. It doesn't matter

824
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,040
the ordering of these two, right? It's

825
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,880
just switching the order, but you're

826
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,160
taking absolute value sign anyway. So it

827
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,720
doesn't matter. And it's also clear that

828
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,200
it's zero if and only if these two

829
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,880
points. It means that the coordinates

830
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,599
are are the same, right?

831
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,680
So and and then in this case the

832
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,680
triangle inequality is not very hard to

833
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,000
establish, right? I mean proving the

834
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,040
trigon even just for the ukleian are

835
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,800
non-trivial thing.

836
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,960
Okay. Now so that's another example and

837
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,400
I want to give you a few more examples.

838
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,319
Here's a sort of interesting

839
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,319
um example.

840
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,720
that if you take suppose you take a

841
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,200
interval

842
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,680
let's just make the interval from 0 to

843
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,960
one so suppose you're looking at the

844
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:42,160
interval from 0 to one and now looking

845
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:44,720
at so this here this is now your space x

846
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,280
and so this means by that I mean that

847
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:52,960
that x

848
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:58,319
x consist of so x there consists of.

849
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:01,559
So an an element in X is an element in X

850
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,559
an element

851
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,079
in X is a continuous

852
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,839
function

853
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,800
on the interval from 0 to one.

854
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,640
So this means that if you take two

855
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,160
elements

856
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,720
So if you take one continuous function

857
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,760
on the interval from 0 to one and

858
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,079
another continuous function what should

859
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,760
be the distance between two continuous

860
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,680
functions

861
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,280
right

862
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,880
well the distance here so this here is

863
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,240
defined to be the maximum

864
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:50,240
of so if you're looking at the if you're

865
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,920
looking at f minus g if f is continuous.

866
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,160
G is continuous. This here is

867
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,359
continuous.

868
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,079
Right? So this means that and now this

869
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,680
is a continuous function defined on this

870
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,040
interval.

871
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:07,359
So the extreme value theorem say that

872
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,720
the maximum

873
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:13,680
in so this here is continuous and in

874
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:18,640
fact even this here is continuous. So

875
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:20,960
the maximum of this here is achieved.

876
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,960
So this is the maximum

877
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:29,040
where x is in 0 to one. So this is

878
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,760
achieved right and this is clearly again

879
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,160
symmetric because of the absolute value

880
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,000
sign is clearly symmetric

881
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:40,800
uh in terms of f and g. It's also clear

882
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,559
that it's non- negative and it's also

883
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,520
clear that it's zero if and only if the

884
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:51,280
two functions are the same. And in this

885
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:56,800
case it's quite easy to prove that uh

886
00:52:51,280 --> 00:53:01,680
that this is a um a metric.

887
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:05,839
Okay. So maybe I'll just leave that.

888
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,920
Okay. Now I want to give you a couple of

889
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,839
more examples and then then I'll stop

890
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,760
with examples and talk about I want to

891
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:14,559
give you a couple of more examples. And

892
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:18,800
the the two next examples

893
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:21,520
are one is um

894
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,640
one I mean so and the reason why I want

895
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:29,040
to give you two other examples is that

896
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,839
it's the I mean just so you know a lot

897
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,240
of things about distances already and

898
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,800
this give you excellent intuition to

899
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,440
proving many things

900
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,559
but you should just keep in mind that a

901
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,839
metric space could be very wild. Okay,

902
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:49,359
so I give you an example of some strange

903
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:52,319
and directly wild metric spaces. So the

904
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:55,599
first one is kind of a strange and then

905
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:59,359
I'll give you another example which is

906
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:02,760
which is wild. to the strange one to a

907
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,760
strange example.

908
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:09,520
And so this is like if you're looking at

909
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,520
the integers. So the space is now the

910
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,520
integers.

911
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:20,640
And so you want to look at what is the

912
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:22,480
distance between two integers. Right?

913
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,000
Now of course your sort of intuition

914
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,920
would say that if one dis one integer is

915
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,760
really large and the other one is not

916
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,319
very large you would think that the

917
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,920
distance was large right but it doesn't

918
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:43,119
have to be large so I defined this

919
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:45,920
distance to be 1 / n minus one / m

920
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:49,359
this here gives you so the absolute

921
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:53,920
value of the difference of one over each

922
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:58,000
of Um this here gives you a distance

923
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,520
and and in particular um you see that if

924
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,040
both

925
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,520
N and M are really large then they are

926
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,359
in this metric they're very close

927
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,319
together right it looks like that the

928
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:14,240
distance is very small

929
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:17,200
now instead of actually proving that

930
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:21,520
this thing here is so you could try to

931
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,839
prove so I mean The as usual to prove

932
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,000
that this is a metric the first and

933
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:28,559
second property the property that is

934
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,920
non- negative that's obvious. It's also

935
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:35,200
obvious that is zero if and only if n

936
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,680
and m are the same. It's also obvious

937
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,680
that it's symmetric right the triangle

938
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,079
equality might be not quite as obvious.

939
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,880
It's not very hard in this case, but it

940
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,040
actually is a triviality

941
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,319
because you could think about this one

942
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,920
here as a map.

943
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:58,400
Suppose you take a map from the integers

944
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:01,119
into the real numbers

945
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,160
and the map is just that you take a the

946
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,400
image of a integer. It's just one over

947
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,280
it.

948
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,799
If you think about the usual distance

949
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:15,040
over here, right? And so the usual

950
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:18,720
distance by that I mean that the

951
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:22,319
distance between X and Y is just this,

952
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:26,720
right? If you think about this but now

953
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,839
thinking about that sinks here that's

954
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:33,680
that's and so you think about the usual

955
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:37,119
distance but you're now restricted to

956
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:39,839
everything not just all real numbers but

957
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,920
just things that are one over integers

958
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:47,599
right on that space it gives you a

959
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,760
a metric okay and but then you can just

960
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,319
think about that this gives you another

961
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,799
way of labeling things. And so it's kind

962
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,680
of a triviality that it is a metric

963
00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:00,240
space. But it but distances looks a

964
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,599
little counterintuitive because right if

965
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,920
you have two very large numbers then

966
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,480
actually the distance between them is

967
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,599
small even though those two large number

968
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,079
could be very far apart. Okay. So the

969
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,680
other thing the the last example I want

970
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,559
to give you that's a kind of example of

971
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,290
a wild metric

972
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,380
and so this is

973
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:23,380
[Applause]

974
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:30,079
this is one

975
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:33,359
vitamin and so essentially all of these

976
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:36,359
occur naturally

977
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,359
um

978
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,359
and so this example is what's called the

979
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,359
French well metric

980
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,240
right? Which is maybe not a super

981
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:48,079
flattering name uh but probably

982
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,280
accurate. So the thing is that if you

983
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,200
travel in France, if you travel, so if

984
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,960
you imagine that this sort of as France

985
00:57:53,200 --> 00:58:00,160
here, here you have Paris

986
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,799
and if you want to go to

987
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:06,480
the French Riviera, which is maybe down

988
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:08,240
here. So, two cities on the French

989
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,440
Riviera that are incredibly close

990
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:15,040
together is K

991
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,200
uh and Nice. This is Can and here you

992
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,040
have Nice. They're very very close

993
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,040
together.

994
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,440
But if you were going to go with the

995
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,680
French railroad, then you would have to

996
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,119
go to Paris first.

997
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,599
I mean, so this here would take you

998
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,240
maybe 20 minutes uh by train if there

999
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,359
was a train, but you have to go to Paris

1000
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,960
first. And that's really far, right? I

1001
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,599
mean, the good thing is that the French

1002
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,240
have this TGB, which is this incredible

1003
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,799
fast train, but it still would take him

1004
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,559
many hours.

1005
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:49,280
Okay. And so that's the idea of the

1006
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,440
French railway metric that the space

1007
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,839
here is

1008
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,000
is R2.

1009
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:01,000
And if you take two points X and Y in

1010
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
R2.

1011
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,160
Now if then what is the distance between

1012
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:13,319
this this pair?

1013
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:13,319
So the distance between the pair is

1014
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:26,799
uh the distance here is

1015
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:31,680
distance between x and y

1016
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:33,839
is um if

1017
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,720
um

1018
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:39,280
if x and y

1019
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,359
lie on the same. So imagine that this

1020
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,520
here is Paris

1021
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,359
and so just think about Paris as being

1022
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,440
the origin.

1023
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:52,000
So if X and Y lie on the same line, so

1024
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,960
lying on the same line just means that X

1025
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,200
here is equal to some constant, right?

1026
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,720
If this has Y,

1027
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,760
then

1028
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,760
X is like a constant times Y. Or you

1029
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,880
could have I mean if one of them was

1030
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,480
zero then you could have that y is equal

1031
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:16,160
to constant times x. So this just means

1032
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:18,799
that these x and y lie on the same line.

1033
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,720
Okay. So if they lie on the same line.

1034
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:29,440
So if x here is equal to

1035
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:32,760
c * y or y is equal to c * x for some uh

1036
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,760
real number.

1037
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:42,960
If that's the case then it's just the

1038
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:47,440
the distance between them. It's just

1039
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,160
like this usual distance here right

1040
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,559
between them.

1041
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,920
But if they don't lie on the same line,

1042
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,000
they may lie on two lines that are very

1043
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,040
very close together.

1044
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,520
Then the distance here would be the sum

1045
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,520
of these two

1046
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,240
otherwise.

1047
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,680
Okay. So that's a French word mic

1048
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,680
if I didn't have some sort of strange

1049
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,359
properties

1050
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,280
some somewhat counterintuitive

1051
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:25,200
properties.

1052
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:30,079
Um the next thing I want to talk about

1053
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:32,880
is um is convergence in a metric space.

1054
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:37,839
So a lot of the things we have done

1055
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:40,400
generalizes to uh general metric spaces.

1056
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:44,680
So first let's talk about what is a

1057
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,680
sequence in a metric space.

1058
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:54,680
So now you have a metric space here. So

1059
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,680
this is a metric space

1060
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,119
and a sequence xn is a sequence. So if

1061
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,200
you have a maybe I should say like

1062
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:11,760
before that if you take a map from the

1063
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:15,720
integers into X.

1064
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,720
This is is a sequence

1065
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,559
and as before the image

1066
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,040
of a integer you would usually denote it

1067
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:31,280
like this. Right? So this is the same

1068
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:36,359
definition that we use for the wheel.

1069
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,359
So this is a sequence a subsequence

1070
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:45,280
a subsequence of a given sequence. Well,

1071
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:49,280
then then you have another map another

1072
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,200
map G from the integers into the

1073
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,680
integers and it's supposed to be

1074
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,680
strictly increasing.

1075
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:09,200
And then you're looking at f of g of n.

1076
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,920
And you think about this, you will

1077
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,640
typically write it like this. f of g of

1078
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:18,160
k say and you would typically write this

1079
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:21,160
as n k right this is a subsequences

1080
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,160
right

1081
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:27,280
right so it's just exactly like the way

1082
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,680
we define it for for the real numbers

1083
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,680
okay

1084
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,680
now

1085
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,359
that a sequence is converging in a

1086
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:44,720
metric space that makes also sense

1087
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:48,960
So suppose that you have suppose that

1088
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:53,960
you now have a general metric space

1089
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,960
and xn is a sequence

1090
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:02,119
in x then we say that we say that

1091
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:10,359
that xn converts to x. So,

1092
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:22,880
so x here is another element in x. If

1093
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,359
for all

1094
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,359
uh epsilon greater than zero, there

1095
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:28,359
exist

1096
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:40,640
there exist a capital n. So that if

1097
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:43,760
little n is bigger equal to capital n

1098
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:47,680
uh then the distance

1099
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,760
between xn and x is smaller than

1100
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,760
epsilon. This is what it means to

1101
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,760
converge.

1102
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,880
Now similarly

1103
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:06,880
the concept of big accusence

1104
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:09,880
this also extends to metric spaces. So

1105
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,880
accus

1106
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,039
the following.

1107
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:41,400
So it's a sequence. So, so a cruise

1108
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,400
sequence let's call it xn

1109
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:46,200
it's the following that for all

1110
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,599
for all epsilon greater than zero there

1111
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,599
exist

1112
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:59,960
capital n such that

1113
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:08,880
if uh little m and little n are bigger

1114
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,280
than this capital n then the distance

1115
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,280
between them

1116
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:21,520
is smaller than epsilon. This is what it

1117
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,960
means to be a sequence. Okay.

1118
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,280
Now we have a theorem that is like the

1119
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,520
same theorem. The proof is like the same

1120
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:35,520
proof but we'll just go over it.

1121
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:41,400
So we have a theorem let's say that if

1122
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:41,400
you have a this theorem is the following

1123
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:51,079
that so again x comma d is a metric

1124
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,079
space

1125
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,720
and if

1126
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:07,160
XN

1127
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,160
is a convergent sequence

1128
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:18,160
in X

1129
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:24,559
then

1130
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:28,200
XN is a cushy sequence is also

1131
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,200
accus C sequence.

1132
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,559
Okay. Now, how do we prove this? So, the

1133
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,280
proof really is kind of the same as we

1134
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:44,000
did before. So, prove

1135
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,599
so we have that xn converge. Let's say

1136
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,039
that the limit is x.

1137
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:54,000
So this means that given

1138
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:57,000
given epsilon greater than zero there

1139
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
exist

1140
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:08,240
capital n such that

1141
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:10,960
if little n is bigger equal to capital n

1142
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:14,319
then the distance here

1143
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:17,199
and I'm using now in a definition of

1144
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:20,480
convergence I'm using not epsilon But

1145
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:24,159
epsilon / two, right? So I have that,

1146
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:27,159
right? But this means that if you take

1147
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:27,159
therefore

1148
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:35,920
if little M and little M if they're both

1149
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:41,759
bigger than capital N and you're now

1150
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:44,560
looking at the distance from X M to XN.

1151
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,600
Well, by the triangle inequality, this

1152
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:50,400
thing here, it's it's worse or it's

1153
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:53,640
certainly not better if you go over this

1154
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,640
other point.

1155
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,640
But you see this one here and this one

1156
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:03,960
each of them is smaller than epsilon

1157
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,960
over two.

1158
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:12,239
So this thing here is so the difference

1159
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:15,359
here is bounded by epsilon as it should

1160
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:17,839
be. So this proved that if you take a

1161
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:20,080
convergence sequence then it is a cushy

1162
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:23,040
sequence. Remember that cushi

1163
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:28,480
convergence theorem was saying that in

1164
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:30,640
Rh if you have a cushi sequence

1165
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:34,159
then it was also convergent right but

1166
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,480
that actually fails this is not true and

1167
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:39,520
it's like some important property of a

1168
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:43,520
metric space if it has the cush

1169
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:46,080
convergence property so let me give you

1170
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,480
a very simple example

1171
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,159
so suppose

1172
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,839
that your metric space. So the space

1173
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:56,640
here,

1174
01:09:53,839 --> 01:10:00,400
let's just take the interval

1175
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:05,760
from 0 to one. And what is the distance

1176
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:09,360
between two elements? So x and y

1177
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,840
are in this interval from 0 to one.

1178
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,159
What is the distance? I just take the

1179
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,920
usual distance,

1180
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,120
right?

1181
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:23,920
But now if I'm looking at this sequence

1182
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:28,360
here xn which is 1 / n right this thing

1183
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,360
here is a cushy sequence.

1184
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:40,960
It is a cushy sequence. Right.

1185
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:44,480
Right. Because when n and n are really

1186
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:48,320
large then both of them is close to this

1187
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:52,000
end point right but they don't converge

1188
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,640
because they in the larger space are

1189
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,880
they converge to zero but zero is not

1190
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,520
part of the space so they don't converge

1191
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:03,360
to anything in this space right so this

1192
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:07,040
is an example so this is an example so

1193
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:11,719
so it's a sequence but

1194
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,719
XN does not converge

1195
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,600
in x

1196
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,760
zero.

1197
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,679
This is because zero is not part of this

1198
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,199
interval,

1199
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,760
right? And zero would have to be the

1200
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:32,000
limit. Yeah. Is that the only

1201
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,719
>> No, no, this but this is this does

1202
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,880
provide an important example of counter

1203
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:39,679
examples because then it becomes like a

1204
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:43,120
question can you make the space cushy

1205
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:45,520
complete okay and sometimes you can

1206
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:48,080
sometimes you can't so but it's that's a

1207
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,960
good question and and but it is I mean

1208
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:54,000
it seems utterly trivial example but

1209
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,760
it's not I mean it is kind of I mean it

1210
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,920
does show you this sort of important

1211
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,080
part that you uh that is useful. It's

1212
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,199
often useful to have the kushik

1213
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:07,760
convergence property and so can you

1214
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:10,760
enlarge the space to to get that

1215
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,760
property.

1216
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,640
Um okay

1217
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:19,840
uh let's

1218
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:24,560
talk about uh what it means for a

1219
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:29,440
function to be continuous also.

1220
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:34,159
So uh and now so now I want to

1221
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:38,520
now I want to think about so I have a

1222
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:38,520
so I want to think about continuity

1223
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,360
for general metric spaces

1224
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:53,360
and one can do this even more generally

1225
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,360
but let me settle on something sort of

1226
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:58,239
in between something more general and

1227
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:03,280
and what we already have.

1228
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:06,719
So I have a metric space here

1229
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:12,600
and I'm thinking about that I have a map

1230
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:12,600
from this space into R

1231
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,880
and then I I want to and so what does it

1232
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:24,760
mean for this function here to be

1233
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,760
continuous? So f is continuous

1234
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,920
at some point x0

1235
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:36,159
in this space.

1236
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:39,440
If

1237
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:44,440
for all

1238
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:44,440
epsilon greater than zero they exist.

1239
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:54,080
They're also greater than zero. So that

1240
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:57,360
if the distance between X and this X0

1241
01:13:54,080 --> 01:14:01,880
is smaller than delta

1242
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,880
then their images

1243
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:12,320
is epsilon close together. Okay. So you

1244
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,480
see this is kind of like you know this

1245
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,280
is like a kind of obvious generalization

1246
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:21,920
of how we defined continuity at a point

1247
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:24,080
for when x was part of r. And so of

1248
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:28,640
course the function is so this is a

1249
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:31,800
continuous in a point and so f is set to

1250
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,800
be continuous

1251
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:43,239
if it is continuous

1252
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,239
uh at all points.

1253
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:58,120
Okay. So this is what it means for a

1254
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,120
function to be continuous.

1255
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:05,840
Um okay. Now

1256
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:09,960
uh let's just let me just give you an

1257
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,960
example of something like this.

1258
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:16,560
So remember before we looked at the

1259
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,120
continuous functions. So we looked at

1260
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,719
where the space was the continuous

1261
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:26,000
function on the interval from 0 to one

1262
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:28,960
and we said that the distance between

1263
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,760
two continuous functions defined on the

1264
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:36,760
interval this thing here is um is the

1265
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,760
max

1266
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,239
of the differences here

1267
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,640
like that.

1268
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,040
And that was that's quite easy to see,

1269
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,719
but it's a good exercise to do. It's

1270
01:15:53,040 --> 01:16:01,360
quite easy to see that this is a metric.

1271
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:05,199
Now I can so I have so this is a metric

1272
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:09,199
space. So now I can think about so now

1273
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:12,000
here's an example of a function. This is

1274
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:16,719
a function that

1275
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,159
is like evaluating. So, so now you see

1276
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,760
this getting a little bit abstract

1277
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,440
because now I'm thinking about a

1278
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:26,640
function

1279
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:30,480
on so I now looking at the function

1280
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:33,760
so from x into r

1281
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:37,600
but in this case x here is a space of

1282
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:41,600
continuous function on the interval.

1283
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,199
Okay. So what should be my So my

1284
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,520
function

1285
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:48,880
is now supposed to be defined on a

1286
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:52,480
continuous function, right? And I just

1287
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:56,640
take it to be equal to the value of this

1288
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:59,520
continuous function at the initial end

1289
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,520
point initial point in the interval.

1290
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,520
Okay.

1291
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:10,840
And I claim that this function here so

1292
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,840
so the claim is

1293
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,520
that this capital f is continuous.

1294
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:26,480
So, so again it's it's it's it's like

1295
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:29,440
continuous in this sense that you have

1296
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,199
this general metric space and this here

1297
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,480
is

1298
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:38,360
sort of just so that it lines up with

1299
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,360
with u

1300
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:46,159
with the example.

1301
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:48,000
So we have this general metric space and

1302
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,159
we have now a map from this general

1303
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,120
metric space into R. This is definitely

1304
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:55,600
a map from this general metric space

1305
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,560
into R. Right?

1306
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:04,000
And I claim that this is continuous in

1307
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:06,800
this sense here. Okay. And uh and that's

1308
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,640
also quite easy to prove. And let me

1309
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,159
just give you uh so let me just make one

1310
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,800
observation.

1311
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:17,920
that if I'm looking at this thing here,

1312
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:21,199
so this is the image or under this map

1313
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:25,120
in one continuous function and then I

1314
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:27,920
subtract the image in another continuous

1315
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,320
function and now I'm looking at this

1316
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:34,159
difference here.

1317
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:39,440
But this thing here is nothing but f of

1318
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:42,000
zero and this is nothing but g of zero.

1319
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,600
Right? But you see that this is

1320
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:49,840
obviously less or equal to the maximum

1321
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:54,960
of all x in this interval

1322
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:57,520
of f ofx minus g of x.

1323
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,679
Right? Like that. But that is the

1324
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,679
distance

1325
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:06,560
between these two elements of this

1326
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:09,280
general metric space. Right? And so you

1327
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:12,880
see that you see that this here is an

1328
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:16,159
example with that if you so for given

1329
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,120
epsilon I'm going to pick delta equal to

1330
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:22,239
that epsilon because if these guys here

1331
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:26,080
are now epsilon close by this inequality

1332
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:30,080
their images is also epsilon close right

1333
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:33,920
so so this map is clearly continuous

1334
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:36,159
okay so I'll stop here so there's a

1335
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,040
little lema in the note that we didn't

1336
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:41,840
go through and that lema is just the

1337
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:44,400
lema that I had over here that if I had

1338
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:48,159
a a continuous function and I have a

1339
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:50,960
sequence that converge to a limit then I

1340
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:53,440
could exchange the order of limits and

1341
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,719
the same proof works in a general metric

1342
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:58,000
space. Okay.

1343
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,719
>> Okay. Great.

1344
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,880
>> Yep.

1345
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,080
>> What kind of properties do you need to

1346
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,600
kind of like

1347
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,360
space like

1348
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,560
some kind of like closure under

1349
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,760
>> Yeah. Yeah. Right. That's right. I mean,

1350
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:17,280
so addition, right, is something about a

1351
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,600
field, right? And so in for these

1352
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,239
spaces, I mean, you know, most of the

1353
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,480
things I looked at here, I mean, some of

1354
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,719
it does. I mean, like the continuous

1355
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,320
function has some structure. The space

1356
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,120
of continuous function has some

1357
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,960
structure. It's not exactly a field, but

1358
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,960
it has some of those properties, some of

1359
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:39,520
these algebra. It's like a a important

1360
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,000
example of something called a sea star

1361
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,679
of algebra. So it's have this algebraic

1362
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,040
structure.

1363
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:48,880
Um but but it's not the algebraic

1364
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:51,440
structure you need in order to be

1365
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:55,600
completeness, right? It's not that.

1366
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:58,560
Yeah. And and it's like but it and and

1367
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,679
yeah um I think it's sort of taken us a

1368
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,880
little bit far field but it's the same.

1369
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:08,000
You see this sort of property also in uh

1370
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,920
in you see it so the these are prop you

1371
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,159
know like metric space is extremely

1372
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,640
useful you see it all over the place I

1373
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:17,600
mean like one of many places where you

1374
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,760
see it is also in general reactivity and

1375
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:23,280
in general reactivativity the space you

1376
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:25,679
looking at are typically not complete

1377
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:27,760
okay so so that you know there's

1378
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,640
something about that is you know that

1379
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,800
you reach something in finite time you

1380
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,480
reach it you you're going this is like

1381
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,560
the same thing that you reach like the

1382
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:39,920
end of things

1383
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:44,159
anyway but yeah but it's not the

1384
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,159
algebraic property that is is used for
