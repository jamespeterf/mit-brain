25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,759
June thank you so much for speaking with

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,200
me and our audience today your

27
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,000
experience is truly

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,560
inspiring thank you so much I didn't

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
know I was your first thank you it's an

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,520
honor yes yes no uh it's been great to

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,880
sort of hear and and learn about the

32
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,119
work that you've been doing over the

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,119
last few years and I wanted to just kick

34
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,799
it off by asking you to tell us tell us

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,799
about your personal Learning

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,920
Journey um well let me tell you a little

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,640
bit about my background uh which

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,320
actually connects somehow with um ocw um

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,560
so um in terms of my education I have a

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,920
computer science degree from UMAS Lo

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,880
which is about 40 minutes or so from MIT

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,880
uh many of my University professors were

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,920
actually MIT computer science graduates

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,399
um and I also have an MBA from the

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,160
Harvard Business School um in terms of

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,800
how summarize my Learning Journey um I

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,920
mean a combination

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,959
of uh formal education as I've just

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,200
described and then just you know

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,319
complimenting my education here and

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,160
there uh I think because of these

52
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,160
lectures that I had who had been at MIT

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,480
um and we were a lot of our CK was

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,280
actually mimicking MIT classes right so

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,000
when it came to studying I and I by the

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,599
way I went to if I can date myself I was

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,519
in undergrad I graduated in 2005 so a

58
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,480
long time quite a long time ago um and

59
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,680
that's actually how I Came Upon um open

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,800
learning um effectively to complement

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,319
what I knew the MIT students were

62
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,360
studying um to help me perform better

63
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,959
you've you started by taking some

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,239
courses on uh MIT open courseware but

65
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,879
you you certainly didn't stop right and

66
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,239
so you know you've you've definitely

67
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,239
been engaged in sort of online learning

68
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,959
continuous learning uh upskilling

69
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,080
throughout your career even after sort

70
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,879
of two really significant degrees so

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,560
what what motivates you to keep learning

72
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,319
right um you're a busy professional how

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,200
do you you know how do you make the time

74
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,799
why why is it important to

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,560
you oh I almost feel like there's no

76
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,840
choice right I mean like in our company

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,640
for example I mean we're trying to apply

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,280
technology to some very complex um you

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,360
know you know comp Computing problems

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,280
that would say or mathematics problems

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,760
in um in logistics right um so I also by

82
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,599
the way I should say this I happen to be

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,640
one of those people who um I apply so

84
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,400
much of what I learned in uni both in

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,599
undergrad and graduate school like often

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
times people say oh whatever I learned

87
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,439
you know I'm not using I am the exact

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,120
opposite of that right so building on

89
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,640
that is you know context right you know

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,920
the way we think about I think the way I

91
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,720
fundamentally think about solving uh

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,159
problem solving is the same but the

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,519
context is constantly changing right

94
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,239
there's new ways of solving some of the

95
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,639
same problems or if you're if you're

96
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,199
getting to if you're encountering a new

97
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,320
problem you need a new way to think

98
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,919
about it right and the solution can

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,759
either come from you it can you can

100
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,479
borrow from other people right and if

101
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,440
you're borrowing from other people it

102
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,560
could be traditional it could be new

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,320
right and the the way to get that

104
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,560
information is to insert yourself you

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,919
know into materials talking about what

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,639
you know how other people are thinking

107
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,680
about these things or even enhancing

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,960
your own knowledge if you're trying to

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,039
come up with your own solution so for me

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,120
I you know I just think I have

111
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,199
absolutely no choice but to continue

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,240
learning and in our company we have our

113
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,720
team members are quite young um you know

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,520
often times they recent University

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,080
graduates

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,039
um I do not write software anymore I

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,320
used

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,400
to I I just don't one of the things for

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,440
example I'm trying to do is you know

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,479
we're using languages that I didn't use

121
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,199
you know when I was a student like I

122
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,440
think we used C or something in computer

123
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,479
science by using Ruby I need to learn

124
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,400
how to use Ruby on Rails but more

125
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,919
importantly we're also trying to apply

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,440
um technologies that have advanced

127
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,360
significantly in the two decades since

128
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
our I've been outside of school right

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,560
whether it's things around machine

130
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,000
learning artificial intelligence and so

131
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,160
on so some of the work I have to do in

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,720
terms of learning is relearning what I

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
learned in school so I'm actually I

134
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
actually go through some of my old

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,240
curricula and then introducing new

136
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,960
Concepts you know on top of that so it's

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,880
I I I it's just embedded in I think

138
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,400
learning has to be embedded in what

139
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,160
we're trying to do and what I'm trying

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,199
to accomplish

141
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,840
yeah that's a that's a fantastic story I

142
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,560
think it reminds us that um that the

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,039
education that we get with our degrees

144
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,080
for those of us who have had the

145
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:18,160
opportunity to study right um is

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,039
sometimes very a set of concrete skills

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,720
but it's really just an investment in

148
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,199
our future right but if you don't keep H

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,800
it's if you don't keep investing right

150
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,280
if you don't sort of keep watering the

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,400
plant right it it won't continue to grow

152
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,599
um

153
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
that's that's really that's really neat

154
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,199
so you've talked a little bit about some

155
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,960
of the work that your company does right

156
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:45,800
uh SGA Technologies um and um and the

157
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,560
ways that technology and software um and

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,520
software solutions to Logistics problems

159
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,440
um are part of the work that everyone in

160
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,639
your company does but um uh you've also

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,960
in in other discussions that that we've

162
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,039
had um sort of reflected that it's been

163
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,639
difficult to come

164
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:06,560
by software developers right to to hire

165
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,319
recruit train retain them um so tell us

166
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,479
a little bit more um about how you've

167
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,120
managed not only to sort of continue

168
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,800
your own education um but to kind of

169
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,840
build this up um for your all the all

170
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,560
the people who are part of your

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,960
team so it's less an issue of finding

172
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,280
software developers because there are

173
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,120
actually plenty of them here but more

174
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,440
about finding software developers we can

175
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,639
afford

176
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,759
in you know in an era where software

177
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,560
Engineers are such a hot commodity right

178
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,560
and you know you bring them up and you

179
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,039
know Google Microsoft or whatever comes

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,879
and snaps them um so for us it was

181
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,400
actually more the issue was more

182
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,759
resource constraint right um not be you

183
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,360
know when I started this company

184
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,039
initially I was bootstrapping it using

185
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,960
my savings and then when we got got

186
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,720
initial

187
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,199
funding um it wasn't a super substantial

188
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,759
amount so we've had to run a really

189
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,280
really lean company right and that meant

190
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,800
we couldn't afford senior developers and

191
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,560
and so on and then even if we could you

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,560
know there's um because of how hot the

193
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,280
market was for engineers they wouldn't

194
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,720
they likely wouldn't have lasted because

195
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,639
you know there's always somebody who pay

196
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:23,879
them more so the approach I took was to

197
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,280
hire um very high potential um younger

198
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,280
people right so fresh um computer

199
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,440
science graduates you know folks who'

200
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,839
been who were just grad uating been out

201
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,719
of school for no more than three years

202
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,880
um yeah so so that's that was the

203
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:44,720
fundamental problem um and then the way

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,360
ocw actually came into the SAA story it

205
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,600
it was not intentional um at all so what

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,399
happened was there was a candidate um

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,399
who had been recommended by one of our

208
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,480
Engineers um she was an electrical

209
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:01,720
engineer and she was very very green and

210
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,519
we initially rejected her application

211
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,160
right so um her name is Cynthia and um

212
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
the person who had recommended Cynthia

213
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,000
is called Warren um so I got back to I

214
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,680
did so I reject her and she doesn't say

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,600
anything um much like how I used to be

216
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,120
when I was a candidate I I don't take

217
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,760
rejection very

218
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,000
well maybe I don't maybe she was lunch

219
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,560
lunch who knows but um in any case I I

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,360
get back to Warren and I'm like hey so

221
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,079
this is the feedback on your friend you

222
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,120
know um she's just too green and you

223
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,079
know he says she's really high potential

224
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,480
like you need to just think about that

225
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:39,200
again so we go back and I you know I I

226
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,680
talk to Cynthia and and she was working

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,040
she was designing some kind of Hardware

228
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,440
uh board somewhere and I was like okay

229
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,320
that's pretty cool for someone who's

230
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,720
barely out of school um and I just you

231
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
know and I thought okay she was very

232
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,360
very bright what she didn't have was a

233
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,360
computer science um degree which for us

234
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,519
is very very critical in our company

235
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,680
because we are applying algorithms

236
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,920
complicated Al algorithms and

237
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,399
complicated

238
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,240
math um and I just thought well you know

239
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,040
when I was a student there was this

240
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,519
resource mod ocw that I used um where

241
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,279
you could learn some of these things

242
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
right they were complimentary to these

243
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,240
textbooks you know so I just suggested

244
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,480
to her hey

245
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,200
um you could join s if you're willing to

246
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,680
quit your job and do this for six months

247
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,160
and I created a curriculum for her which

248
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,000
actually mimicked the last two years of

249
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,680
um the computer science program and she

250
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,519
said yes and some and then we ended up F

251
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,560
finding this path of um bringing on

252
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,600
board you know otherwise talented um

253
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,440
individuals who for one reason or

254
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,279
another do not have the education we

255
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,959
need right so as of today we've done so

256
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,959
Cynthia she did that program in

257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,279
202 was it last year maybe a little bit

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,000
I think she started um end of 2022

259
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,560
true no no no end of 2023 because this

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,399
is our first full year actually as an

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
engineer at Sanger um and then we've

262
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,040
since put two other individuals through

263
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,040
that program right um one the second

264
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,360
person we put through is actually not a

265
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,240
full University graduate is someone who

266
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,079
comes from an other resource

267
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,320
background um but had the desire to be

268
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,720
an engineer had gone to a coding boot

269
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,120
camp coding boot camps for us to not

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,279
give uh folks what they need uh at least

271
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,560
for what works in our company uh we put

272
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,440
him through that and then we've since

273
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,440
put in someone else who has a similar

274
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,079
has sort of like a similar skill set so

275
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
we've been able to complement you know

276
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:47,000
so we've been able to complement our

277
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:50,000
team so half our team um is from this

278
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
program wow yeah yeah so that's really

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,360
interesting um and that's exactly the

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,519
kind of story that makes us excited at

281
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,240
open learning um it's the kind of thing

282
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,880
that motivates the staff who work here

283
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,839
and certainly the faculty at MIT who

284
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,839
share these materials they don't have to

285
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,200
do that they don't uh they don't get

286
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,839
paid to do that um they sort of sharing

287
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,839
these materials in order for other

288
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,320
people to use them now it sounds like

289
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,040
the special sauce right that comes from

290
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,480
from s Technologies from June odongo is

291
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,279
that is your work in identifying from

292
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,800
this big curriculum of materials exactly

293
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,519
what's valuable for you and your firm

294
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,680
and your team um so that's some some

295
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,160
really amazing work uh it does raise for

296
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,320
me another question um you know i' I've

297
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,680
I've taken courses watched videos and

298
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,399
lectures from from open courseware um

299
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,199
and some of them are really

300
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,959
hard um and some of those problem sets

301
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,560
that we that we share with the world are

302
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,279
are really difficult um so I'm curious

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,880
you know uh your the staff who who

304
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,160
you've kind of shared this curriculum

305
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,199
with do they do they think it's too hard

306
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,720
do they think it's hard and fun what's

307
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,720
what's been their reaction

308
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,480
it's

309
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,800
hard I mean they're very complex courses

310
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,160
I mean you know you know networking

311
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,079
Theory you know algorithms you know I

312
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,920
don't know if they consider it

313
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:21,320
fun um no one's told me they find it fun

314
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,680
uh but one thing that's Universal

315
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,920
amongst them is that

316
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,920
um the amount of learning they get is so

317
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,120
so so significant you know just in a in

318
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,800
a span of six months right um so I think

319
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,120
they feel better about themselves you

320
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,040
know in terms of what they're capable

321
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,040
even from a learning

322
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,920
perspective there must be at a moment um

323
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,160
in in their work or or even in your own

324
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,639
um where that light bulb goes off right

325
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,880
where you're just dealing with some

326
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,920
really tricky work problem right um and

327
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,360
then suddenly you know you realize you

328
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,639
have the tools right um because of

329
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,680
because of a course that you took

330
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,360
through open courseware or something

331
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,959
else

332
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,519
right you reminded me of

333
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:15,160
something um so the team member who

334
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,399
recommended Cynthia um was also

335
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,320
mentoring her um during that process and

336
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,759
one of the courses is um you know is

337
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,839
something called automata I forgot the

338
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,600
full name of the course um and whatever

339
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,839
problem he was working on at the time he

340
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,720
was like oh goodness like you know there

341
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,079
was something in the automata class that

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,880
he was helping Cynthia with that he

343
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,120
recognized could help him solve a

344
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,480
problem that he was working

345
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:49,120
on yeah so it's almost like yeah it's

346
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,720
almost like this extended hook in the

347
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,720
learning right it's not just for the

348
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,320
person who's going through it because

349
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,880
what we also do is we want them to

350
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,120
present to us something um at the end of

351
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,000
the coursework right on some topic so in

352
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,360
Cynthia's case for example it was graph

353
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,120
Theory right like could you tell us what

354
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,320
you learned on on you know on in graph

355
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,680
Theory right so what happens is there's

356
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,360
a relearning also for someone like me

357
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,399
and then um I remember there some

358
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,959
algorith I forget which

359
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,240
algorithm she presented and I was like

360
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,639
oh my God this is an Insight I had in

361
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,040
terms of you know these kinds of like

362
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,160
nodes I was thinking about in in sort of

363
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,519
the network design for the logistics and

364
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,040
I couldn't remember that you know I had

365
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,639
been taught this I don't even know if I

366
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,000
was taught it but I was like you know it

367
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,440
was very validating for me because I'm

368
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,240
like oh wow I recognized something by

369
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,680
myself that is in that is in a textbook

370
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,519
yeah you know yeah yeah no it feels

371
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,480
pretty

372
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:58,079
great I I love it I love it it's um and

373
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
that's a part of the joy of teaching and

374
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,759
learning right and some of that happens

375
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,199
in the classroom but it but it happens

376
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,480
our whole lives right um so let me turn

377
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
now and ask um sort of the the bigger

378
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,399
question you know we've I've shared a

379
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,440
little bit about why MIT does this you

380
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,160
know the big so what question right and

381
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,480
I want to hear from you a little bit

382
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,600
about about the kind of impact that that

383
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,560
you try to have I mean you have not just

384
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,959
developed a company you've also uh

385
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
you've been involved in and starting

386
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,360
nonprofits um you know you've been

387
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,160
trying to make an impact um in the world

388
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,240
and I wonder what advice you would give

389
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,600
to to other people right um to the

390
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,319
younger version of yourself right um or

391
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,360
someone who's out there today um for how

392
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,360
they could you know how they can make a

393
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,160
difference I think the impact question

394
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,279
is Big um I don't know what I would tell

395
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,959
my younger self but I think I I can

396
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,720
think of what to tell other folks which

397
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,720
is um for

398
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,560
me there are certain kinds of oh the

399
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,360
ideas or

400
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,520
problems that latch onto me so

401
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,600
viscerally that I feel I have no choice

402
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,480
but to get involved in solving the

403
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,319
problem or addressing the problem and

404
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,839
when I have that

405
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,640
emotion

406
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,760
um I just pursue the emotion you know I

407
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,959
think that's sort of behind the

408
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,400
nonprofit the nonprofit We have is

409
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,120
called Zoom Memorial found foundation

410
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,440
and what we do is we equip

411
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,720
um community centers and schools in in

412
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,440
very rural underserved places with

413
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,280
computers and Computing

414
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,160
education and that is linked to my dad

415
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,880
so my dad was an electrical engineer um

416
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,160
unfortunately he died when I was quite

417
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,919
young like uh more than 20 years ago but

418
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,679
I would hear stories of folks saying oh

419
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,679
he showed me my first computer or you

420
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,120
know the first time I touched with a

421
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,480
computer was with your dad or he taught

422
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,799
me this or whatever

423
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,440
and um and I wanted to do something you

424
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,280
know to

425
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,320
continue you know let's call it his work

426
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,159
and that's how and you know a little

427
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,600
tiny story um I worked for this company

428
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,799
called EMC in hopkington a data storage

429
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,400
company that's now um acquired by Dell

430
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,200
and it was Earth day and they were

431
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,760
recycling computers like there was some

432
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,760
email where computers were being

433
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,159
recycled and can I just say I was crying

434
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,159
at my desk had broken up with some

435
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,159
person and I see this email I'm like

436
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,400
wait I sto crying and I'm like I know

437
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,760
what we could do with those computers

438
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,840
and those computers end up um long story

439
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,240
short we end up kicking off the

440
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,960
nonprofit that way by refurbishing these

441
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,600
things uh with the company in terms of

442
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,080
how I got interested in logistics it's I

443
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,679
just was so frustrated I was moving

444
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,400
quite a bit in a short period and just

445
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,600
moving was so awful and I was like

446
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,720
people have been moving since time in

447
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,120
Memorial like why does moving suck so

448
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,960
much and I just got sucked into

449
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,280
Logistics not that I had necessarily a

450
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,320
passion for Logistics but it was a a

451
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,200
nagging problem and then I'm also very

452
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,799
big on not regretting things I'm very

453
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,320
big on the regret Min minimization thing

454
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:18,280
um so I tend to just ask myself at any

455
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,600
given point like if life ended today

456
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,799
like would this would I feel okay about

457
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,320
where my life has reached and sometimes

458
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,080
the answer is yes and sometimes the

459
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,440
answer is no and I find it's yes when I

460
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,159
feel I've done something that was

461
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,559
meaning meaningful to me and seen it

462
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,720
through completion or a good outcome or

463
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,080
something that could continue and I find

464
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,320
that it's new and I'm in the middle of

465
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,520
something I'm like oh wait I have this

466
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:46,240
thing to do um yeah so for me yeah I

467
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,720
just I just move with um what grips me I

468
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,320
think or I would say man no that's a

469
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,240
fantastic story that I I appreciate that

470
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,799
you know those kind of personal

471
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,120
connections that whether it's with you

472
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:03,320
know with a family with a just a moment

473
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,320
that hits you um that uh that that you

474
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,640
know we feel things and and then we re

475
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,039
you know we reach out right and and act

476
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,440
on them um and build you know either as

477
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:17,360
individuals or or with others um is

478
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,679
there a role for open education um in

479
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,039
that in moving from that that visceral

480
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,799
feeling to the

481
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:27,360
doing I mean for sure but I would just

482
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,280
add just one point to my earlier one is

483
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,159
to also just go for it even if you don't

484
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,200
know how it's going to end up so in the

485
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,720
story of the nonprofit what I did was I

486
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,120
just wrote the company back and I said

487
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,440
could you give me those computers and

488
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,679
then before I knew it they were

489
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,080
interested in the idea then the me and

490
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,919
my colleagues were refurbishing the

491
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,120
computers and then they were donating

492
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,400
money like I just never foresaw that I

493
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,000
was just like give me the computer so

494
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,120
folks should just

495
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,280
start um and then in terms of

496
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,480
um with open learning you know so after

497
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,120
I um at some point I think earlier in

498
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,480
the year late last year maybe a year ago

499
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:11,520
I posted I did a LinkedIn post about the

500
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:15,720
coursework um and the response was

501
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,960
pretty good in that folks said you

502
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,200
know we didn't know we could learn this

503
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,840
way or you know can you show me um where

504
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,679
I could complement

505
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,919
this where I could mine courses um for

506
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,840
my company so a friend of mine for

507
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,880
example runs a um a rose Farm in Kenya

508
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,240
and she's in agriculture so her problems

509
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,440
are different um and you know and she

510
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,840
asked if I could help figure out how

511
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,480
they could also use um open learning

512
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,240
right in her come in her case it's a

513
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,200
company of 800 800 people many of them

514
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,520
are firm workers right so how one would

515
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,320
think about um what kinds of lessons one

516
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,520
could glean from something such as open

517
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,880
Lear learning it's you know very

518
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,480
different it's a very very wide scope um

519
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,360
so for me I think it's it's pretty

520
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,360
applicable in just about every scenario

521
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,320
right their classes on how to think

522
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,320
making decisions for example like for me

523
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,440
I I have this deep interest in

524
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,120
behavioral um economics just how one

525
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,120
thinks about you know when you're

526
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,520
Building Technology but the behavior of

527
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,039
folks you know which is always not how

528
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,039
we think about things rationally like

529
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,520
how do you like how do you think about

530
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,120
this so for me um in almost every

531
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,919
setting I think somebody can find

532
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,080
something in open learning that's going

533
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,799
to um complement that thinking you know

534
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,600
whether it's something pretty basic or

535
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,000
something pretty

536
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,880
Advanced right okay no that's that's

537
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,080
inspiring and I'll I'll borrow that line

538
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,520
just start um know we'll sort of I think

539
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,279
a lot of people will take that away from

540
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,480
our conversation and and speaking of all

541
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,240
those other people um it's time now I

542
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,679
think to to to Pivot and now I think it

543
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,679
would be a great chance for us to take

544
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,679
some questions from the

545
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,600
audience all right so June I wanted to

546
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,080
just uh start with one question that

547
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,360
came in from the audience um from one of

548
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,480
our online from Mary um who was

549
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,080
listening in and hearing about the ways

550
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,000
in which you've talked about how you've

551
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,600
upskilled your workers um and yourself

552
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,799
uh on the technical front um but one

553
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,919
thing that Mary's asking is um how how

554
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,159
or what recommendations you would have

555
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,600
for helping people develop their their

556
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,159
social skills in communication in

557
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,840
leadership um in networking um have you

558
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,480
found resources to do that and have you

559
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,720
done that in your own work and have you

560
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,880
helped people in s Technologies do that

561
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,880
as

562
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,520
well okay so I think um hi Mary first

563
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,480
thank you for your

564
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,480
question um so for communication

565
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,760
I think many of my colleagues used to do

566
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,279
Toast Masters and that worked for them

567
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,400
so if Toast Masters is around you

568
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,039
somewhere I I would recommend that

569
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,960
because I think many people can write

570
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,400
well or communicate um through writing

571
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,960
um and it's sort of you know

572
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,960
communicating verbally or in public uh

573
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,919
spaces or in meetings um that tends to

574
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,320
be difficult maybe because of confidence

575
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,919
or that kind of a thing so I would

576
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,039
recommend something as simple as Toast

577
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:41,399
Masters um something that was useful to

578
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:44,640
me was um learning tips on something

579
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:47,000
called executive presence I remember um

580
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,159
looking at executive presence tips uh

581
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
very early in my career things like you

582
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,440
know sit up you know when you're

583
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,520
talking um you know how you should stand

584
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,000
and and things like that for me um I

585
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,559
found those to be super super super

586
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,520
valuable um especially in the early days

587
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:10,840
when trying to establish my career um

588
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,960
for my team um I think the current

589
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,919
generation is facing I think a different

590
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,880
set of communication problems I think

591
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,200
that that we used to face you know for

592
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
us it used to be a lot about public

593
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,520
speaking but I I think because of a lot

594
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,600
of social media and so on I you know

595
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,919
what I see commonly is um writing

596
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,159
writing challenge

597
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:36,480
Alles right um or being very Curt in

598
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,039
writing you know very very brief um so

599
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,880
for our team the thing that I'm usually

600
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,440
pushing on is just written

601
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,360
communication right um no you know I

602
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,200
don't like to see slides or that sort of

603
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,399
a thing I want someone to express their

604
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,679
idea in writing and I with the correct

605
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,760
spelling and things like that and I will

606
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,320
send it back um if it is not if it

607
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,919
doesn't meet that standard yeah so so I

608
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,279
I think it just depends on you know

609
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,600
where someone is in the career what

610
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,919
their background is and so on um and and

611
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:12,600
just also observing if the someone who

612
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:15,000
one admires who speak well speaks well I

613
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,919
think there's nothing wrong in emulating

614
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,799
that yeah yeah no I think that um among

615
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,399
other things one of our most popular

616
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,799
videos on MIT open courseware is from

617
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:29,720
the late professor Patrick Winston um

618
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,520
entitled how to speak um and um and it's

619
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,679
been picked up you know millions of

620
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,159
times millions of views and I think it's

621
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,919
just an indication of the importance not

622
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,840
only of mastering technical content um

623
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:42,600
or business content or other things but

624
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,000
actually being able to express it and to

625
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,399
share it right I I'll look for it

626
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,440
now but you had you had mentioned

627
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:54,880
actually um you know the importance of

628
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,039
emulating a public speaker um uh as As

629
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,960
One path toward developing someone's

630
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,520
personal public speaking skill skills

631
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,080
and that brings me to another question

632
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,480
this came in uh from Rodrigo um who has

633
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,600
also joined us uh and online and sent

634
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,279
this via email um who asked who who was

635
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,720
your most influential Professor right um

636
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,360
so who you know who most influenced you

637
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,600
as you were learning and whether that

638
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,600
was in the classroom or

639
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,360
outside H hi Rodrigo oh that that is a

640
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,360
difficult

641
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,080
question I I got along so well with my

642
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
professors

643
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,120
and and even professors in my school who

644
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,559
were not teaching me directly like one

645
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,720
of the people I think who was most

646
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,840
impactful to me was this guy called

647
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,440
Professor

648
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,480
Maloney uh who worked at EMC which I end

649
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,000
I ended up joining he was not my

650
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,360
professor but we got along and then I

651
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,320
you know I got an internship at EMC that

652
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,039
I ended up um not taking and then I got

653
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,000
a full-time position and you know I

654
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,440
don't think I would have gotten that

655
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,840
without him because I had not imagined

656
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,840
working for a company like that or an

657
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,440
industry like that

658
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,600
um yeah I think Fred Martin is someone

659
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,559
who stands out to me he oh my goodness

660
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,159
he was an MIT grad actually I think now

661
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,760
he is a he might be dean of the Cs

662
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,080
Department of University of Texas at

663
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,039
Austin yeah so I I I didn't really enjoy

664
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,480
very much my Hardware

665
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,559
courses but he was my professor and he

666
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,880
made it fun and I and I did well and I I

667
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:33,080
think I purely really did well because

668
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,720
he was great um you know uh yeah so yeah

669
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,559
I don't know I love I love Academia I I

670
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,600
love many people so I really cannot pick

671
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,000
just one person I cannot no that's a

672
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,880
great point in many ways part of the joy

673
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,559
of learning is learning from different

674
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,519
people in different ways right and so

675
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,559
sometimes there is one individual

676
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,559
teacher or Professor who makes that huge

677
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,440
difference but sometimes it's that it's

678
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,159
the the range of them that makes all the

679
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,960
difference in the world world and why we

680
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,200
need to kind of keep learning and keep

681
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,360
finding new new voices new mentors as we

682
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,760
move in different parts in our

683
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,440
lives nice um so one thing um another

684
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,159
question that that has come in and I

685
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,519
think this is really important for uh a

686
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,480
valuable sort of insight that might be

687
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,200
valuable to other people who are looking

688
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,200
to use sort of mit's open resources in

689
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,480
training employees and their

690
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,039
organization um which is the question of

691
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,360
of assessing the impact right and and

692
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,240
the learning right so a lot of our

693
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,600
course offerings particularly on MIT

694
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,159
open course whereare they're you know

695
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,799
they're open they're self-paced um

696
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,559
there's no sort of necessarily metrics

697
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,200
of whether you've passed or failed right

698
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,000
our mitx courses do have assessments

699
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,320
they do have uh you know certificates

700
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,919
for people who complete them but for you

701
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,640
um as manager and as the CEO um how did

702
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:01,080
you how did you know um you know how did

703
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,360
you measure or or did you um that your

704
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,399
employees when they were using mit's

705
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,120
open resources were were mastering the

706
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,679
material that they were learning to

707
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,679
apply it and they actually really were

708
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,679
making a difference in their

709
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,519
work well in our case you know I would

710
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,840
say the

711
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,120
measure there were three kinds of

712
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,960
measures though I I think one well one

713
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,440
is

714
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,480
not you know I don't know how useful it

715
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,200
was which was you know do the exercises

716
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
in the course you know don't just listen

717
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,679
to the classes do the exercises and then

718
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,519
report it was self-reporting which is

719
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,559
why you know I don't know how you know I

720
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,399
don't know what we can say about that

721
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,320
but self-report on how you performed you

722
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,240
know you know because at some point you

723
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,720
know answers are given and you can see

724
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,720
whether you got something correct right

725
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,240
so that was one um and then the second

726
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,519
measure um was actually the pace of

727
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,039
learning right um one can tell

728
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,080
how one is doing you know based on

729
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,559
whether somebody is like taking too long

730
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,679
or something like that you know like

731
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,399
just like what's going on and then also

732
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,039
ask asking questions because we are

733
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,320
familiar with the material you know

734
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:18,120
because we are technologists and then

735
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,960
also asking the the um team member who's

736
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,480
going through it to present on a key

737
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,200
Topic at the end of

738
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:30,240
it right um so to present well you need

739
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,639
to at least Master at a theoretical

740
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,960
level what it is you're going to present

741
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,960
oh right because we you know all of us

742
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,159
gather together and you need to make a

743
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,880
case and we're learning and answering

744
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,799
asking questions that we you know we

745
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,279
want answers from um so those are those

746
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,240
were some of the ways to measure and

747
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:52,919
then the last one I would say is

748
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,120
just you know application because our um

749
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,159
ultimate intention is that the way of

750
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,600
thinking about a problem is

751
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,360
reshaped um so then the proof of the

752
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,639
learning is in the pudding right which

753
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:11,080
is your actual output once you start um

754
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:12,960
solving problems within the team yeah no

755
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,880
I think and I just just want to I just

756
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,919
want to add something on this so one of

757
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,960
my very close friends is a um I was

758
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,080
about to say he's a CTO but he's now a

759
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,440
CEO at this financial technology firm

760
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,720
here that's doing really well and he has

761
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,960
helped recruit just about every engineer

762
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,600
in our company and we've been talking

763
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,880
about recruitment a lot uh

764
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:41,519
because of um you know these uh

765
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,960
gpts that help people um you know answer

766
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,399
questions you know like once upon a time

767
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,120
you could give a coding exam and you

768
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,320
know you know and and you know you watch

769
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,279
somebody do it and now you know somebody

770
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,039
can do it online and you know and then

771
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,000
credentials like you know I've mentioned

772
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,360
before I think even earlier in this chat

773
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,720
that you know having a computer science

774
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,840
degree is very important to us like he

775
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,279
challenged me on that actually quite a

776
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,320
bit and he is someone who also holds

777
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:13,240
like a masters and you know bachelor and

778
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,080
Masters in computer science um we're

779
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:21,519
changing the way we hire to test problem

780
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,320
solving right and yeah so it's actually

781
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,559
a long about credentials because we have

782
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,159
had experience and I think many

783
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,000
employers have had this where folks can

784
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,120
have the most amazing credentials they

785
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,480
still can't do the work MH right and

786
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,799
what I'm finding also is folks who are

787
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,320
self-directed and have um a lot of deep

788
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,600
interest and I think this was true too

789
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,360
when I was an engineer myself the best

790
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,519
Engineers ended up being folks who just

791
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,159
for whatever reason they chose that

792
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,240
career and they didn't actually

793
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,000
necessarily go through a machine like me

794
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,720
for you know learning right they for

795
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,399
whatever reason they just had this like

796
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,000
deep passion and they opted in right and

797
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,360
you know I I think that's where some

798
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,399
such as open learning uh becomes very

799
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,119
powerful and actually someone added me

800
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,399
on LinkedIn um and when I looked at his

801
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,119
profile he had switched his career into

802
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,119
Finance or something just from open

803
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,919
learning like I literally just looked up

804
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:22,000
his profile yesterday right complete

805
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,520
switch of a career right

806
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,599
so

807
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,240
um I people people see good work you

808
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,240
know people see good work work um the

809
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,240
world is changing it's hard to argue

810
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,679
with uh folks who work hard yeah yeah no

811
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,040
I think those are great points and I

812
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,200
think it U the the proof is in the

813
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,280
pudding as you say right um and and I

814
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,079
would also pull out the importance of of

815
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,119
pres knowing that someone has learned it

816
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,520
by having them present on it right I

817
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,599
always say right the best way to to

818
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,160
learn something is to teach it right and

819
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,160
to be able to teach it to others um and

820
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,760
also um that

821
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,040
sort of self-pacing self- ownership

822
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,520
right um so it's so the you know in some

823
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,240
ways you're opening learning

824
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,640
opportunities to people in your firm um

825
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,960
but it's really up to them right to to

826
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,520
to track their progress to to apply it

827
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,640
and and that that's the best way for

828
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,839
them to learn it but I think the number

829
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,480
one thing I'll take from what you just

830
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,040
said is that phrase opt in you know sort

831
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,920
of just opting in to to learning to

832
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,680
curiosity um is is really key to what it

833
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,160
means to be an agile work worker in in

834
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,160
the 21st century right these

835
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,800
Technologies are are changing so rapidly

836
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,400
um and that any even the best degrees um

837
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,560
won't last anyone for a lifetime anymore

838
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
if if they ever did

839
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,400
right and okay so let's um I want to

840
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,400
switch now to a little bit um uh some of

841
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,079
the questions that have been coming in

842
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,200
are really about you um and and and your

843
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,000
work and and your your journey so so I'm

844
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,839
going to sort of turn turn some of those

845
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,520
to you right now um and so one of the

846
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,800
things that that comes from from Mark um

847
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,880
along the way is a question about um

848
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,720
what's the most valuable lesson that

849
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,839
you've learned as as an entrepreneur um

850
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,200
you've reflected a little bit um in our

851
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,280
conversation about um you know sort of

852
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,640
be being an entrepreneur um what's a

853
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,079
what's you know what's one that you

854
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,640
would share with

855
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,000
Mark oh Mark hi that is a tough tough

856
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,000
tough

857
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
question um

858
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,400
most valuable so first I I think

859
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,880
entrepreneurship is

860
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,040
more for me it's like a it's a career of

861
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,240
the

862
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,720
heart uh because it's just so difficult

863
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,079
to be an entrepreneur like you know

864
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,040
everyone's read about you know the

865
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,480
roller coaster emotions and you you know

866
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:04,000
the you know difficulty in maybe getting

867
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,319
financing and you know product Market

868
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,599
fit and all these things the I mean the

869
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:12,480
reality

870
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:15,319
is is much much much tougher um than one

871
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,880
we'll ever read anywhere or even if you

872
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:19,920
have friends who are entrepreneurs and

873
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,040
you are observing them there it's just

874
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,040
one of those things where you you can't

875
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,079
actually explain what it's like to be an

876
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,920
entrepreneur you just have to experience

877
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,960
said and and that's why I think like my

878
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,520
mom my mom is a businesswoman and

879
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,800
there's a time she had told me you know

880
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,079
like the way the things she's pursued

881
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,920
it's when she can't sleep over something

882
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,880
right and it's persistent and she just

883
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:52,720
cannot run away from you know an

884
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:55,119
idea and you know I think

885
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,160
entrepreneurship you know is or should

886
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,640
be should be um driven by that kind of

887
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,119
thing a kind of

888
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,880
obsession uh because it's there's so

889
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,319
many things that are happening to make

890
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,640
you want to quit right and just to give

891
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:12,440
you an idea like I

892
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,200
know I know very many entrepreneurs I

893
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,599
know entrepreneurs who do not have

894
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,880
resources who have a lot of resources uh

895
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,319
but all of them sort of suffer the same

896
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,240
the kinds of emotions they suffer are

897
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,160
Universal right so I think if it's not

898
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,560
driven by something inter colel um it

899
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,000
can be very challenging I mean of course

900
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,119
there people who are just super rational

901
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,920
about it and they have a Time plan and

902
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,319
you know in three years they're out and

903
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,720
you know they've sold the company and

904
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,800
whatever they know how to do it like an

905
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,760
assembly

906
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,520
line um but yeah i' would say yeah I

907
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,760
think the heart piece is probably the

908
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,599
for me it's the thing that's kept me

909
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,000
going and therefore I would say you know

910
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,560
that's the

911
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,599
lesson well that's fantastic that that

912
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,760
sticking to it right is is really

913
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,640
important and that um so that's also a

914
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,200
question that comes in from uh from

915
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,880
YouTube from Christopher who asks um how

916
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,720
do you stick to your learning goals

917
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,920
right um so in some ways it's it's that

918
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:16,160
related question right um is the answer

919
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,160
is the answer they the the

920
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,440
same um hi Chris

921
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,720
um I I think let me talk a little bit

922
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,680
about my Primary Learning right now

923
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,119
which is um reading a lot of biographies

924
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,839
from

925
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,720
Founders okay and found a podcast like I

926
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:43,040
love love love this podcast called um

927
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,920
Founders you know which is and and and

928
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,760
in the definition founder is um not just

929
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,599
someone who started an Enterprise but

930
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,119
you know historical people who've just

931
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,359
done enormous things so it's anyone from

932
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,960
a Rockefeller to

933
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:00,720
Oprah um just stand outs and

934
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,119
um so I'm I'm a bit obsessed with that

935
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,040
um and you know so basically this guy

936
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,880
called David SRA just summarizes this

937
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,319
book so I end up buying some of those

938
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,880
books and then subscribing to something

939
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:12,960
called Founders notes which is a summary

940
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,440
of the books you know and I literally

941
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:21,200
have like five of those like up on my

942
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,280
screen um all the time just refer to um

943
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,280
I'm not measuring my learning right now

944
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,720
as something around breath right so it's

945
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,800
not I don't need to have like a a wide

946
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,520
scope for me it's like the depth of

947
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,160
something and sometimes it's just a

948
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,400
singular concept that I'm sticking on um

949
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,680
and that and then that concept is

950
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,560
changing because sometimes it's

951
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,960
something about like you know what makes

952
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,280
a great team but sometimes it's how you

953
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,480
know how do you apply technology like

954
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,640
you know like in our case even

955
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,079
internally not just externally for our

956
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,640
customers um and then you know I've

957
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:56,400
mentioned you know for example I like

958
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,440
something like behavioral economics so I

959
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,920
have Richard T book right and then there

960
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,440
just a set of books that I just keep in

961
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,160
front of me even if I haven't read them

962
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,119
sometimes I'll just pick and try to go

963
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,079
and see if it's referring to something

964
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,960
um so I don't have a specific goal I I

965
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:16,119
would say for me it's a moving Target um

966
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,800
and then I just find that at any time

967
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,640
when I'm struggling with a particular

968
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,520
concept for whatever reason something

969
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,880
you know if something pulls me to it

970
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,400
like we we're building some kind of a

971
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,640
document reader um using something

972
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,839
called Clover AI I think I saw someone

973
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,760
post on LinkedIn like this paper by

974
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,720
these students you know and I was like

975
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,359
oh let me just read this you know and

976
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,640
then it ends up being this thing that's

977
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,440
now very a very very key part of what

978
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,040
we're offering as a company so yeah so

979
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,440
sometimes like it's just clicking now

980
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,119
now I don't have a calendar I don't have

981
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,720
a list of things I have to learn yeah um

982
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,440
that's good to know that's good to know

983
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,359
because I think for someone um who's

984
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,960
hearing your story story right um

985
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:03,040
imagines that um you know that it's all

986
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,800
very all very disciplined all very by

987
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,440
the book so it's proba so it's very

988
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,960
heartening um to know that sometimes you

989
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,839
just fall down a rabbit hole right um

990
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,760
and just uh and just Discover

991
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:16,079
right and that's good because that's

992
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,559
actually one of the questions that came

993
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,119
in um on YouTube um from a um was asking

994
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,880
about whether it's better to be more

995
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,200
more uh you know more systematic or to

996
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,200
uh or to go down these new nous rabbit

997
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,040
holes um and I think you know I'll take

998
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,760
a stab at answering that question that

999
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,800
um I think it's important to to do a

1000
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,280
little bit of both right that sometimes

1001
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,520
um there is a a need if there's a if you

1002
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,000
know that there's a particular skill

1003
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,599
right that you need to master right to

1004
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,920
try to find a path to doing that right

1005
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,599
and here in open learning we're sort of

1006
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,160
developing and we'll be rolling out sort

1007
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:00,559
of new tools for people who come to our

1008
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,880
website to actually find guided pathways

1009
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,839
through our learning you know through

1010
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,839
their own learning Journeys right so if

1011
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,720
they say I want to you know understand

1012
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,920
um you know this corner of data science

1013
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,640
where I really need for my work to be

1014
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,960
able to understand you know how vacines

1015
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,480
work right and that'll be coming over

1016
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,760
the course of the next year so I

1017
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,440
encourage people to come back you know

1018
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,359
early and often over the next few months

1019
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,280
as we roll those things out um but

1020
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:29,400
there's also you know I think what um

1021
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,119
you know in our our YouTube viewer

1022
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,920
described as a a rabbit hole another

1023
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:37,599
term for that is Serendipity right is

1024
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,079
you never quite know and you gave an

1025
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,160
example of that you know you stumbled

1026
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,920
across a post on LinkedIn you followed

1027
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,200
you followed the links and it and it led

1028
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,200
you in a new direction right and so um I

1029
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,640
wish you know for my answer to that

1030
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,599
question to um to our friend on YouTube

1031
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,480
is I I wish I knew um you know which

1032
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,240
things were um were serendipitous door

1033
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,880
opening transformative experiences which

1034
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,280
are just rabbit holes um and I'm not

1035
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,520
sure you know it until you see it is

1036
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,240
that your

1037
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:14,040
experience saradipity is my favorite

1038
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,119
word oh great yeah yeah yeah it's my

1039
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,680
it's it's I feel that that's what gu

1040
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,119
that's what guides me

1041
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,200
personally and so when do you turn from

1042
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,119
Serendipity to structure that's probably

1043
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,319
what you know what people who are you

1044
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,400
know the difference between between uh a

1045
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,400
creative person with entrepreneurial

1046
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,319
Ambitions and an entrepreneur like

1047
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,280
yourself so how do you turn from

1048
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:38,280
Serendipity to

1049
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,640
structure I I don't even know how to

1050
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,760
answer that question because I I feel

1051
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,720
like these things go hand in hand okay

1052
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,200
you know you've heard those saying

1053
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,760
around you know like opportunity comes

1054
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,599
when you're ready and you know um and

1055
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,400
and things like that so I I I see it I

1056
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,800
see it very much like that I mean day to

1057
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,319
day as a company for example we have a

1058
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,240
plan you know that needs to be

1059
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,000
structured right um but I also typically

1060
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,079
say that we have you know an emergent

1061
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,240
strategy right which is yes we have this

1062
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,559
plan and we're supposed to we what we

1063
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,200
think we should do is go down this path

1064
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,720
but at the same time we're taking in

1065
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,400
information you know to see if there's

1066
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,480
new data that says maybe there's

1067
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,240
something we can change right um

1068
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,640
sometimes the thing that makes you

1069
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,599
change that strategy is what we can call

1070
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,440
certainity because you you know

1071
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,760
something catches you and then it you

1072
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,400
know brings together this other thing

1073
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,640
that you had learned but it allows you

1074
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,319
to see it in a new way or it opens up a

1075
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,079
path for you to go further that you

1076
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,839
wouldn't even have foreseen yourself so

1077
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:54,839
I I don't think it's about you know

1078
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:57,839
turning from structure to Serendipity I

1079
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:00,720
mean I think these things coexist

1080
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,440
right oh fantastic that's great

1081
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,760
advice so another this is related in

1082
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,040
some ways to a question that came in

1083
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,240
from Neema um and so Nema is asking um

1084
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:15,760
in today's sort of World um sort of fast

1085
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:20,520
moving high-tech world right um how how

1086
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,839
can someone best learn quickly right um

1087
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,319
and then maybe I'd also ask you to

1088
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,960
reflect on what are the things that you

1089
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,160
think people need need to be learning

1090
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,160
right

1091
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,200
now that's a good question Sima yeah and

1092
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,280
I think they're kind of related so how

1093
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,280
do you learn

1094
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,400
quickly

1095
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,160
um I think you learn quickly by training

1096
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,359
yourself to learn in the first place

1097
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,040
yeah

1098
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:53,960
yeah um like I just noticed something

1099
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,920
this this week like I was in a I was in

1100
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,559
a board meeting and I hadn't read the

1101
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,000
board pack on time and I felt very very

1102
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,720
guilty because that's a very bad thing

1103
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,920
and I open up it was like 46 pages and I

1104
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,640
was able

1105
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,079
to go through all the pages in a

1106
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,680
relatively short time and I ended up

1107
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:16,839
asking the most questions um in that

1108
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,520
particular meeting and I I was actually

1109
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:19,880
surprised by myself and I realized oh

1110
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,680
once upon a time when I was in grad

1111
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,520
school I was reading you know 100 Pages

1112
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,839
a

1113
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,200
night right and because I used to read

1114
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,040
100 Pages a night now I can go through

1115
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,520
you know half of that in a very quick

1116
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,400
period um so I think learning fastest

1117
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,559
just training yourself training yourself

1118
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,920
to learn and you know

1119
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,520
creating maybe environments of focus

1120
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,000
while you're learning so that you can

1121
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,800
absorb what you're learning because then

1122
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,520
you're going to feel better and you're

1123
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,920
going to notice that you're learning and

1124
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,559
then it's just going to get easier and

1125
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,319
easier I think it's learning is just a

1126
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,000
muscle like you know like anything else

1127
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,720
that's what that's what I would say

1128
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,240
absolutely um yeah and you also need of

1129
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,680
course like things like a clear mind and

1130
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,319
that sort of a thing you know so

1131
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,760
understanding the kinds of environments

1132
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,640
that allow you to learn better because

1133
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,119
for example if you if you if you've

1134
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,440
slept well you're going to learn quicker

1135
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,079
you know things like that or maybe if

1136
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,520
you had coffee I don't know um and then

1137
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,800
and then I drink a lot of coffee um and

1138
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,920
then um so the other question was uh

1139
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,920
what should people learn

1140
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,800
now um I have sort of two reactions to

1141
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,359
that and I think even something on the

1142
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,119
on the previous question so I'm not one

1143
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:38,000
of these people who is a fan of like

1144
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,640
learning fads like I just I am anti them

1145
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,079
you know like in this last decade when

1146
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,839
when folks that were just like everyone

1147
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,680
should learn how to code you know the

1148
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:48,559
last 10 to 15 years I'm like come on you

1149
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,599
know we need people who are creative we

1150
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,240
need people who can Market we need

1151
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,920
people who understand philosophy and

1152
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,920
psychology and and and so on like

1153
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:03,160
they're very very important um even in

1154
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,359
in very very technical areas um so I

1155
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,400
it's so so when I say that I think it's

1156
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,960
difficult for me to pick what someone

1157
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,440
should learn because I you know I think

1158
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:15,160
people should learn the things that that

1159
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:17,559
they enjoy um otherwise you know it's

1160
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:21,440
not I mean you can know a lot and do

1161
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:24,640
nothing with it right um and but then if

1162
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,480
I had to um pick something to learn

1163
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,920
right now it's you know I really really

1164
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:34,400
dislike this Buzz of

1165
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,680
AI especially as a as a CS person um the

1166
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,480
term is misused and that sort of a thing

1167
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:45,119
but we cannot deny the super fast pace

1168
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:47,400
of things like we just cannot deny it

1169
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:51,599
right so if there's anything I I would

1170
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,760
say somebody needs to learn now is about

1171
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,440
the technologies that are completely

1172
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,119
reshaping our landscape because there

1173
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,680
are affecting us and will affect us

1174
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:03,760
whether we like it or not um and we just

1175
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,599
have to get on board with them and and

1176
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,040
it's it's it's a simple as that yeah no

1177
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,799
I think I think you're right and I think

1178
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,760
those those are going to transform every

1179
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:14,720
workplace right at the same time I

1180
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,319
couldn't agree more right the importance

1181
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,760
um that you've identified of of you know

1182
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:20,280
people learning in all different

1183
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,079
directions right and following their

1184
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,760
passions and you know whether they're uh

1185
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:26,119
in Psychology and economics and

1186
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,200
marketing all those fields that you

1187
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:29,119
mentioned

1188
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,119
so this brings us I think to the final

1189
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,680
question um which is directed at at you

1190
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:37,839
U what will you be looking to learn um

1191
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:42,000
the next time you visit MIT open

1192
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:44,000
courseware well outside of the um how to

1193
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,240
speak that's the immediate thing I'm

1194
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,599
going to look for great that's fantastic

1195
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,040
um yeah yeah yeah uh so that's the

1196
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,200
immediate thing I'm going to look for

1197
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,640
but outside of that um still very

1198
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,839
interested in the sort of like

1199
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:02,680
Behavior the behavior of things and then

1200
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,880
um I need to use statistics and I did

1201
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,000
not like

1202
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,839
statistics once upon a time I need to

1203
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,559
brush up so just brushing up on you know

1204
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:14,359
on on on previous previous knowledge uh

1205
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:17,400
still just because of my day-to-day work

1206
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:19,520
