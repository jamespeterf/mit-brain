1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
energy we use and how we cure diseases.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,639
It has the potential to drastically

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,559
reduce our reliance on greenhouse gases.

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,960
But there are enormous challenges to

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,839
getting promising advances from labs to

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,760
the market. Standing up a large-scale

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,520
manufacturing facility can run up to$2

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,840
billion. The field is full of regulatory

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,720
hurdles and workers need advanced

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,880
training. Jay Christopher Love looks

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,399
ahead at promising biio manufacturing

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,160
solutions and what it will take to scale

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,090
them. Please welcome Professor J.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:51,609
Christopher Love.

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:51,609
[Music]

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,840
It's a pleasure to be here. Let's talk

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,920
about how biotechnology can be one of

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
the most important technologies in the

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,880
21st century. In order for it to realize

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,479
its potential in enabling

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,640
sustainability,

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,119
uh changing the accessibility of drugs

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
and medicines and foods globally, we're

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,040
going to have to rethink manufacturing

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
to achieve that. So, in the next 30

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
minutes plus the time that we have for

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,360
questions together, let's really look at

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
three things. One, what is the

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,119
bioeconomy and what is the potential

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
that it unlocks?

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,520
Two, what are the challenges in thinking

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,159
about transforming manufacturing as it

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,680
stands today? How do we not just build

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,680
more of the same, but actually overcome

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
some of the fundamental challenges in

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
the way that it's practiced presently?

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,079
And then three, let's look ahead to what

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,399
that technology base might look like

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,479
that really changes the game for

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,719
enabling biotechnology across the board.

41
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,640
If we think about biotechnology, some of

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,000
you may think about this in the context

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,280
of medicines or perhaps in food

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,720
products, things that you maybe interact

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,000
with. What you might not realize is that

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
biology now has the potential to impact

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,840
nearly every product and material that

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,520
we interact with. Up to 60% of all goods

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,440
could be manufactured with materials

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,720
sourced from biological sources in the

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,040
next 10 to 20 years. And in terms of

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
growth and economic impact, the

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,640
bioeconomy is estimated to be anywhere

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,519
between, you know, a few trillion to to

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,000
maybe a 10 trillion dollar industry in

56
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
the next uh 15 years with the US

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,800
accounting for maybe about a trillion of

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,319
that. And so it has this opportunity to

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
really impact all of the different ways

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,800
in which we think about the world around

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,000
us in relation to all of these other

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
technologies we're talking about.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,680
It also offers this really remarkable

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
benefit that I think we all kind of

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
appreciate. Everyone likes going to the

66
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,680
beach and having a nice day in the sun.

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,080
The sun is a really uh large source of

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
energy and biology is actually quite

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
good at capturing that. May not be as

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,959
efficient as as we would like it to be,

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,560
but it is a source of renewable impact

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,400
and biology by its nature uses that

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,800
energy and transforms it into things

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,519
that it intends to produce. What's cool

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,000
about biotechnology now is that we get

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
to impact what it is that it does with

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,159
that energy. And so this has led to a

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
lot of ideas like circular bioeconomies

79
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,560
where we might be able to generate uh

80
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,879
you know use biomass that's that's a a

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
waste product in one in one uh value

82
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,959
stream and use that as an input into

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,120
another value stream and to do this in a

84
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,120
way where we're extracting the most

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
information and content and value out of

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
each of those different stages along the

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
way.

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,319
This is an ideal picture. You can see

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
it's a cartoon. Our our challenge now is

90
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,200
in how do we realize this and how do we

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,720
make this this a

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,319
reality. What I will tell you is that

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
and this is just one study. There's a

94
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,760
couple of studies that have now looked

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,599
at this in terms of dollars invested.

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,640
Biology is one of the most efficient

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,640
ways to transform

98
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,640
sustainability. So built materials built

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
built infrastructure concrete

100
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,280
transportation these are all

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,440
contributors to greenhouse gas. Uh but

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
biology because of its potential impact

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,479
on how we think about food technologies

104
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,479
and sustainable practices in agriculture

105
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,120
per dollar invested actually has the

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,560
potential to uh to really drastically

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,479
change that that that that

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,199
infrastructure th those greenhouse gas

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,199
numbers. So biology provides this really

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
efficient path towards improving

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
sustainability globally. So this all

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
sounds really fantastic and great and

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
you know I think that a lot of you may

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,199
have seen this in a variety of different

115
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,440
ways in which there's now emerging parts

116
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,080
of this ecosystem that are being played

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,120
out uh in in in the current environment.

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
But the question that we've been

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,040
thinking a lot about is how do you

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
really transform and unlock this

121
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,400
bioeconomy? We heard earlier that the

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560
the defense base in the United States is

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
largely built from small and medium

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,040
enterprises that participate in that

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,639
infrastructure. It adds resiliency. How

126
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,880
do we think about the manufacturing

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,960
infrastructure that's necessary in order

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,919
to enable this kind of picture of a

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,639
bioeconomy that can transform materials,

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,400
foods, and

131
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,800
medicines? One of the kind of arguments

132
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,479
is that we will need a really large

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
supply chain in order to do this. And so

134
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,000
what this really means is that we have

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
to take

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,960
ideas from the research, right? A lot of

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,440
us at MIT think deeply about how to make

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
uh new kinds of organisms or engineer

139
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,440
organisms to do particular tasks. This

140
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
is a common space now called synthetic

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,600
biology or engineering biology. Uh

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
metabolic engineering is a way to sort

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,680
of create fine chemicals and other

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
materials that you might

145
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,880
need, medicine, cell therapies and and

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,320
all of these are these are ideas that

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,600
are coming out of academic centers and

148
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,360
startup companies. But in order for

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
those to actually reach the marketplace,

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,039
manufacturing still stands in the way.

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
It's like big secret, right? is a

152
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,560
manufacturing conference. Manufacturing

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
is the key. But manufacturing today is

154
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,759
messy. It's hard to do. It's uh very

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,560
manual. And so how do we efficiently

156
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,280
enable this type of economic cycle to

157
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,479
pair with that idea that ideal state of

158
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,680
a circular

159
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,440
bioeconomy? And one of the challenges in

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,199
this is that we actually now have

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,720
created a different kind of supply chain

162
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,639
needs. So, the types of supplies that

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,560
you have to make, all of those very

164
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,479
exciting things like mRNA vaccines that

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,479
we just heard about a moment ago or

166
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,759
organs on a chip or artificial tissues,

167
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,680
all these things that are like right at

168
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,319
the forefront of biomedical innovations

169
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,120
or food products like cultured meats,

170
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,600
these all rely on a supply chain of

171
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,360
lipids and DNA and proteins and and

172
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,880
things that come only by biology. These

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
aren't things that we can make easily by

174
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,960
chemical synthesis, but those materials

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
themselves are created from chemicals.

176
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,880
And so we're kind of inserting this new

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
part of our supply chain that's going to

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,319
be necessary to think about how do we

179
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
address that and then how do we use that

180
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,520
to generate all of these different

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,280
ideas. So the problem is getting messy.

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
It's not simply that I want to make one

183
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,720
kind of product now, but I need to be a

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,919
wide range of different kinds of

185
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,880
products and I have to do this

186
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,880
affordably and at scale.

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,199
One of the real challenges in the kind

188
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,400
of current infrastructure for

189
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,960
manufacturing using biology is that it's

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,720
really hard to do. How many of you have

191
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,039
been to a biommanufacturing plant or run

192
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,120
one? Yeah, a good number. They kind of

193
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
look like this picture over on the right

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
of people. They're gown up because you

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
want to maintain aseptic operations.

196
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,840
There's a lot of stainless steel that

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
tends to be in these plants. They're

198
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,880
kind of modular and compartmentalized.

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,880
You see here a picture of some of the

200
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,240
reactors. There's another suite that's

201
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,960
charged with recovery of the

202
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,639
products. This picture and the time and

203
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,199
cost of building these types of

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
facilities doesn't match the pace of

205
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,599
innovation that we're now seeing in the

206
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,919
ideas for what we can do with biology.

207
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,039
The biotechnology is happening faster in

208
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,560
the lab than we can keep up with. And so

209
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,280
right now there's a large effort to

210
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,599
think about where do we have capacity

211
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,080
globally? How is it uh used? Europe has

212
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,160
a really strong uh infrastructure for

213
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,240
fermentation capacity here unlike the

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,000
United States. Uh but a lot of this

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
capacity is already spoken for, right?

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,720
Companies own it. They use it for their

217
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,560
own products and there's not really a

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
lot of available capacity. So where do

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,160
all of those new products go? If I'm a

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
venture capitalist, I'm not going to

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
invest, you know, $200 million in a new

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
plant. And we were talking before about

223
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,680
value added productivity. This is really

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,680
poor industry for this. you know, we

225
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,800
have to process a lot of material with a

226
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,320
lot of workers in order to get, you

227
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,240
know, what's a relatively small volume

228
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,240
of material back. So, the process

229
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
intensity in these plants is really low.

230
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
You can kind of even just see that in

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
the picture of how much space there is

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
relative to that. And that has a large

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
impact, that costs the environment

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,279
something. When I build a really big

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,200
facility that I have to put a lot of

236
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
people in and walk around in and have

237
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
all the gowning to maintain that

238
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,680
asepticness and the raw material flows,

239
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,080
that puts a large load on HVAC. So the

240
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,080
the recirculating air accounts for about

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
50% of the total energy cost in one of

242
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
these large facilities. So if you build

243
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
a $2 billion plant, you know, most of

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
your carbon footprint is coming from the

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,680
HVAC that you have in that facility, not

246
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,920
to mention all the support utility and

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,519
the uh waste disposal that goes along

248
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,760
with running and operating these

249
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,200
plants. From a energy perspective, it's

250
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,360
bad. From a water perspective, it's

251
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,519
perhaps even worse. Right? This industry

252
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
probably uses 10 to 100 times more water

253
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,040
than most other ones. It's not very

254
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,360
intensified. And a lot of this has to do

255
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
with how biology works, right? We're we

256
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,600
get dehydrated. Uh this is this is

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
natural. So some amount of water is

258
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
required. But how do we recycle water

259
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,560
more efficiently? How do we make sure

260
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
that we're not using steam for

261
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,160
sterilization? That's an energy cost and

262
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
a water cost. Where can I put these

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,440
things? Uh I spent some time on

264
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
sobatical at at a large

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
biioharmaceutical company and every day

266
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
the executive vice president walk by and

267
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
say, "You're a smart MIT professor. Tell

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,399
me how I stop shipping water around the

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,399
world." Because in this industry, water

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,720
shipment is a is a big deal,

271
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
particularly for for finished products.

272
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,839
So, how do we do things that don't have

273
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,399
the same transportation tax on water

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,839
that that is kind of currently enabled?

275
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,279
So, if I just build more of the same,

276
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,959
not only is it costly, there's very

277
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,120
little capital interested in doing it.

278
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,680
And but I also have to face additional

279
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,760
sustainability challenges by scaling up.

280
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
and oh yeah the world's getting more

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,279
complicated in ways that you know I

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
think we all appreciate you know

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,680
geopolitical uncertainty the logistics

284
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,279
that kind of come with that where is my

285
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,160
supply chain come from today in this era

286
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,320
of globalization biotechnology relies on

287
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,640
a very diverse supply chain from around

288
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,959
the globe uh you know I think there's

289
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
market headwind in in a lot of different

290
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,760
directions on biotechnology currently uh

291
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
it's very hard to manufacture these

292
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,839
things at scale for for uh for for new

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
kinds of food products The

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,920
biioharmaceutical sector uh has been

295
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,920
successful in bringing products to

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,000
market but there's an increasing demand

297
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,079
on kind of the reliability of those in

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,040
the public markets before uh seeing the

299
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,399
value inflections uh consolidating

300
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
supply chains on the vendor side.

301
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,920
There's very little room for innovation

302
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,600
in technologies now uh that are

303
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,200
different than what's kind of currently

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
being operated just because of the scale

305
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
at which it's being done for a very

306
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,880
small number of manufacturers. And then

307
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,800
the climate and we've talked about but I

308
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,800
think is maybe not fully appreciated is

309
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,880
the acceleration and pace of new. We

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
just heard a talk about AI. Many of you

311
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,200
probably seen AlphaFold the protein

312
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,279
folding tool. Companies are now like

313
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,519
ideulating new ideas for drugs that are

314
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,519
very very specific and targeted to

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,320
particular rare diseases and such using

316
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,320
these types of technologies. And so the

317
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,720
number of ideas that are being generated

318
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
really does outpace our ability to think

319
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,839
about the manufacturing. one of those

320
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
large facilities like I just showed you

321
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,680
maybe has 20 slots a year and if you

322
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,440
know 15% of them are free because

323
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,560
they're not being used for other things.

324
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,079
How do I get that backlog

325
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,920
through? So we can't just keep building

326
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,519
more of the same kind of infrastructure

327
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,519
in order to actually be successful here.

328
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,160
So if we were to then think differently

329
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,560
right biio manufacturing works we get

330
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,880
drugs to patients they have access to

331
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
medicines that currently exist albeit

332
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,480
mostly in North America and Europe 80%

333
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,160
of all the registered monoconal

334
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
antibodies for biioharmaceutical

335
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
treatments and cancer autoimmune disease

336
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,519
etc are registered in North America and

337
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,120
Europe and not the rest of the world

338
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,800
although certainly much more of the

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,079
global population lives in the global

340
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,320
south you know how do we think about

341
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,560
what those traits need to look We have

342
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,399
to think entirely differently. We have

343
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
to think from a different mindset as to

344
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,320
what the qualities are. Agility is

345
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,720
important. We saw this during the

346
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
pandemic. If you had had u some of the

347
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
components for being able to run

348
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,519
bioreactors hanging around your garage

349
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,519
or somewhere, you could have sold those

350
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,120
on eBay to a bioarmm company for quite a

351
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,440
bit during during the pandemic. There

352
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,920
was a lot of uh swapping of parts and

353
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,079
and and uh supply chain components to be

354
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,480
able to enable their medicines.

355
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,800
Sustainability. How do we build a new

356
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,639
technology base if we don't also think

357
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,720
about sustainability and particularly in

358
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
an industry where by nature it uses a

359
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,160
lot of water, it uses a lot of

360
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,040
electricity to maintain aseptic

361
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
operations. Uh so if we're going to

362
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,480
transform how we make materials and

363
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,240
build a new manufacturing base, we have

364
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,600
to think from the beginning about that

365
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,600
sustainability question. Uh flexibility.

366
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,279
So that facility that I showed you the

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,279
picture of and when I build a plant

368
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,399
today for a billion dollars, it's

369
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,079
usually designed to make one product.

370
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,760
Maybe I'm lucky enough I can make a

371
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,680
handful of products that are all sort of

372
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,680
related in that same one. But to change

373
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
it over from one to the next is cost

374
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
additional capital investment and time.

375
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,440
So these facilities are really designed

376
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,279
for manufacturing very well. one thing

377
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,639
that doesn't really jive with this this

378
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,240
kind of current state where we have a

379
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,600
lot of new ideas coming into the

380
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,880
marketplace through startups and

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,320
academic uh sources and then empowerment

382
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,000
I think uh you know one of the things

383
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,160
that that we've seen as a trend in this

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,959
industry is

385
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,959
consolidation there's been a lot of

386
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,480
different uh companies that have

387
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,800
participated in manufacturing but now

388
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
there's very few companies that supply

389
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
into manufacturing and there's very few

390
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,040
companies that have the capabilities of

391
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,120
really manufacturing at scale this leads

392
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,560
to less competition ition. How do we

393
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,240
know that we have the best medicines or

394
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,240
the best food products, you know, in

395
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,160
other markets and other sectors where we

396
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,920
have competition and there's competition

397
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,240
through the ability to bring products to

398
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,240
market, you know, that enables better

399
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,079
solutions. So, as we think about what it

400
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,639
means to create affordable medicines

401
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,320
that are accessible everywhere, you

402
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,120
empowering others to be able to

403
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,959
manufacture a critical quality. So, I've

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,279
done a really good job, I hope, uh, you

405
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,360
tell me later in the break to set up why

406
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,720
we should do something different here.

407
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,320
question is what do we do different

408
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,000
right biology is hard this is the story

409
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,360
that I often hear you know like biology

410
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
I can't I don't I don't know anything

411
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,199
about it it's this weird thing and like

412
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,839
I can control stuff around it but what

413
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,199
do we do with the biology well so we

414
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
should think a little differently how do

415
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,760
we start to really think uh where this

416
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,160
could go and so I'd offer this as an as

417
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,480
an objective or a goal right most of you

418
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,320
probably have an inkjet printer at home

419
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,760
um some of you maybe have 3D printers I

420
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,760
could use the same analogy of 3D

421
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,040
printers as as this one and maybe that's

422
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,880
a little more timely

423
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,639
But, you know, for 80 bucks on Amazon or

424
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
Google, your favorite source, wherever

425
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,320
you like to go shop for these things,

426
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,920
you can buy an inkjet printer that'll

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
print you something that has the same

428
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,639
quality as something that you can

429
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
produce at a commercial scale. And when

430
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,120
you've created that idea yourself,

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,800
you've used whatever latest AI tool to

432
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,440
make that amazing graphic that's going

433
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,440
to, you know, be your next brochure.

434
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
When you want to tech transfer it to

435
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,399
commercial scale, you just literally

436
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,079
send the file and it prints more. Right?

437
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,920
We see this in additive manufacturing

438
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,680
too. Things are designed for

439
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,360
manufacturability and they're done in a

440
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,440
portable format that allows for that

441
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,800
immediate

442
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,360
transfer. And this is really enabled

443
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,639
because we have standardized systems.

444
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
It's not that the products are

445
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,360
standardized, it's that the

446
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,040
manufacturing techniques are

447
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,360
standardized in order to enable that

448
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,440
particular objective. And so the

449
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
question is in bio could we do something

450
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,040
similar? And just to make this maybe a

451
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
little more pointed and and to think

452
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,079
about what this could look like. I'm not

453
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,880
offering here that we should replace the

454
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,839
current manufacturing

455
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,920
infrastructure. And you know I think one

456
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,240
good example of this is to to dig deeper

457
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,639
into this idea of commercial printing.

458
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,920
Uh this is a a graphic that a couple of

459
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,880
my students put together kind of

460
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,639
estimating the volume of pages per day

461
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
as a function of time. And you see this

462
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,279
goes back it goes back a little further

463
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,120
than u Ben's indices earlier this

464
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,920
morning. You know back to back to 200

465
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,199
when the first wood block printing was

466
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,440
enabled. The Gutenberg press was

467
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,120
generated manual process. You know

468
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,440
the in in that era you could print you

469
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,079
know roughly one page per year per

470
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,000
person. And then we had the first

471
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,760
industrial revolution. So that kind

472
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,799
automated that particular process.

473
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Automation is an important

474
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,520
transformation step. Uh then there's an

475
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,480
increase in the overall volume as we add

476
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,000
more facilities, more capacity. And then

477
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,600
there's this other inflection point at

478
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,240
the top there. This offset rotary

479
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,679
printer. This is now automated

480
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,039
continuous production. If you think

481
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,039
about a printing press, it's a batch

482
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,640
process. I do one at a time. If I go to

483
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,799
continuous and automate it, I can

484
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,799
produce a lot more. Today biio

485
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,480
manufacturing is largely done in batch

486
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,679
mode and manually

487
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,039
operated. So with this centralized

488
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,039
continuous manufacturing you can produce

489
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,600
about 300 pages per year per person.

490
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,919
That's you know roughly you know 100

491
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,280
100,000 printers globally and these are

492
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,039
kind of order of magnitude engineering

493
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
estimates. You'll forgive us if it's a

494
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,240
little off. But I think what's really

495
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,000
interesting is if you think about

496
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,440
another technology that emerged in the

497
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,520
1950s and this was done uh by Xerox and

498
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,919
Park which was one of the you know major

499
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,559
research institutions

500
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,679
uh in the corporate sector in that time

501
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,960
they developed the idea of a Xerox home

502
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:16,640
copier automated small

503
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,799
footprint batch manufacturing.

504
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,600
those technologies improved. You know,

505
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,080
part standardized competition emerged in

506
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,080
the manufacturing of the

507
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,799
manufacturing inkjet printers. And with

508
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,840
that, now today, there's almost the same

509
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,440
capacity globally with this distributed

510
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
manufacturing capacity as we have with

511
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,400
centralized. Both of these two

512
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,039
manufacturing strategies coexist and

513
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,080
they both have uh you know similar kinds

514
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,600
of purpose but they kind of allow for

515
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,880
different kinds of manufacturing uh

516
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,640
goals. And so if we think about this in

517
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,120
terms of biio manufacturing what does

518
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,440
this look like? Well today this is the

519
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,039
model. It's that highly manual you know

520
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
very you can see that in the picture but

521
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,280
like you literally are doing lab

522
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,440
experiments at 10,000 liters and moving

523
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,400
that fluid around. You don't want to be

524
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,360
the guy that drops it on the floor. Few

525
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,840
million dollars of uh of lost material

526
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
when that

527
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,720
happens. And they move this around from

528
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,240
process to process. Very manual, highly

529
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
skilled labors. Most most of the

530
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,799
employees in these uh facilities have

531
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,720
advanced degrees. Uh often uh masters or

532
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,400
PhD level. And there's very few

533
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,840
facilities globally. We have a lot of

534
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
capacity. And if you look and you Google

535
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,360
the numbers, there's a lot of capacity

536
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,039
people will say. But again, a lot of

537
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,600
it's spoken for and there's very few

538
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,960
folks that actually control that

539
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,400
capacity and it costs a lot to build it.

540
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,520
So no venture capitalist is going to

541
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
say, "Hey, I have this really great

542
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,080
biotech company. I want to go build new

543
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
manufacturing at $200 million to see if

544
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,880
maybe your product makes it through the

545
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,160
clinic." That's just a very bad risk

546
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,840
profile. So what we, you know, I think

547
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,559
are going to start to see here is that

548
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,160
there's an increasingly high need for

549
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,520
certain high volume lowmix

550
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
manufacturing. This might look a lot

551
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
like what we're currently doing, but

552
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,799
just at a very very large scale. I don't

553
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,480
know that this is going to be the most

554
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,760
common manufacturing strategy, but we're

555
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,520
going to see it for certain things. For

556
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
certain food products, we may need to be

557
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
able to do this to get to the right cost

558
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,400
per kilogram of something like a

559
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,320
alternative food substance. Uh some

560
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,640
materials and and some medicines. So

561
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,400
like insulin or perhaps ompic, you know,

562
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,400
some of these weight loss medicines,

563
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,679
medicines for infectious disease, very

564
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,679
very large scale, lowmix manufacturing.

565
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
uh will will certainly continue and

566
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,280
we're seeing you know investments in

567
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,640
some of this globally right now but I

568
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,919
think the part that we're going to see

569
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,400
more and more of and there's already

570
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,440
trends in the marketplace is towards low

571
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,559
volume highmix manufacturing this is low

572
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
capex is think about that inkjet printer

573
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,679
analogy uh these are highly automated

574
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,919
systems they take the worker out of the

575
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,640
facility right it's a it's a it's a box

576
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,120
that they can interact with and it can

577
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,960
produce you know regional scale products

578
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
new products you know things that are

579
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,280
and other kinds of biology. So

580
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,039
cell-based therapies, things of this

581
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,559
type. And of course, once you kind of

582
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,480
have proven a market, you can either

583
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,159
scale out with that kind of capacity or

584
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,760
if you really need to, you can scale up.

585
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,679
So I think, you know, there's a new kind

586
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,000
of space in biio manufacturing where

587
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,120
there's an opportunity uh to think about

588
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
new new

589
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,679
solutions. What are those features that

590
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,039
you would have to have to enable? We

591
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,039
might say what are the user requirements

592
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,840
or the specifications has to be highly

593
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,280
intensified. Not everything's going to

594
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,120
fit in the box. So, I got to take out

595
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,320
everything that I don't need. So, that's

596
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,559
going to have to mean that I really

597
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
think about manufacturability up front

598
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,720
of my products to fit into these types

599
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
of facilities. Uh, and I want to

600
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,799
minimize the number of uh lowv value ad

601
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
steps that I have along the way. If I

602
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,080
have to move my fluid from one step to

603
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,799
another one, but I have to hold it for

604
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,280
an hour or two and do an adjustment and

605
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,400
then put it in, that that's not very

606
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,520
efficient. It's not going to fit in my

607
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,039
box very nicely. Modularity.

608
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,120
We see this in in other in other

609
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,280
industries like additive manufacturing

610
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,960
uh even the semiconductor industry where

611
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,080
you have these defined modules that have

612
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,000
si certain fit forpurpose applications

613
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,600
in the manufacturing role that they play

614
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,720
and they do it for that and it's kind of

615
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,320
plug-and-play. It kind of works as as

616
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,559
intended. Uh we've heard a lot about AI

617
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,880
and and machine learning augmentation.

618
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,039
How do you use these tools to

619
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
efficiently transfer from one scale to

620
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,360
another one? How do you use it to help

621
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
predict what the process should be in

622
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,640
order to use it? I don't have to think

623
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,720
when I tell my printer to print my

624
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,559
idea, use the PDF, use the procript, get

625
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,000
this font. You know, it's a problem when

626
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,080
it does. It gives you an error message,

627
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
right? How do we use that type of

628
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,400
augmentation to broaden the workforce

629
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,919
that can participate in the bioeconomy?

630
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,440
And then all of this will really hinge

631
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,320
on automation. This will reduce the

632
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
volume and the footprint of these

633
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,480
facilities. So, these are the features.

634
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,360
How do we get there and what might it

635
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,200
look like?

636
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,880
um the biioharmaceutical industry is

637
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,720
already making a switch in these

638
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
directions. So I mentioned the idea of

639
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,640
continuous production as being a key

640
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,880
inflection in printing. We're seeing the

641
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
same trend occur in the

642
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,000
biioharmaceuticals. This is a nice cost

643
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,919
analysis from a few years ago. Uh

644
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,520
looking at the top line there, this is a

645
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,200
traditional stainless steel facility

646
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,960
like the one that I showed you. Cost

647
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
about a billion dollars to produce in

648
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,880
capital. Gives you very high efficiency

649
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,120
in the overall production rates per

650
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,200
year. But the net present cost when I

651
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,320
start day one is quite high. Right?

652
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,880
Market adjusted forecast. In contrast,

653
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,559
if I switch to a continuous technology

654
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
in this case using singleuse

655
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,960
technologies, these are sort of plastic

656
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,640
bags and materials of this type and you

657
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,559
wait a minute wait a minute. You just

658
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
told me that you want to be sustainable.

659
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,799
You tell me about plastic bags.

660
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,880
Interestingly, in this industry,

661
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,280
switching to plastic is a huge

662
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,600
environmental savings. 90% of the water

663
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,440
and the waste that is treated and used

664
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,640
in those traditional stainless steel can

665
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,720
be eliminated and reduced by going to

666
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,559
these types of single-use technologies.

667
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,480
And the amount of single-use material

668
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,640
that's used in these types of facilities

669
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,880
is like a very small fraction compared

670
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
to the total global plastic output. So

671
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,280
in terms of value of where we spend our

672
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,120
plastic dollars, if you will, uh this is

673
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,960
actually a very efficient one. And when

674
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,880
I do this, I get, you know, a lower net

675
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,880
present value to build that facility and

676
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,679
modular expansion to be able to cover

677
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,200
the same production volumes over time.

678
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,320
So the bioharmaceutical industry is

679
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,760
moving in this direction. And what

680
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,799
they've kind of realized is that there's

681
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,640
actually a I'll call it a canonical

682
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,279
model for what this modular footprint

683
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,880
might look like. This is the continuous

684
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,919
production of monoconal antibodies.

685
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,080
These are the largest selling

686
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,400
bioharmaceutical products by class

687
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,039
globally. uh you know treatments for

688
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,240
cancer, autoimmune diseases. Uh Katruda

689
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,080
is a good example of this from Merc. Uh

690
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
they make these in these continuous

691
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,760
processes where the materials flow

692
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,360
constantly from one to the other. It's a

693
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,279
big innovation in this space where it's

694
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,799
largely been done by batch and using

695
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,880
these types of strategies. You can now

696
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,039
get to about $50 to $100 per gram in

697
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,520
drug substance. That's still too

698
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,159
expensive for the whole world to be able

699
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,320
to sustain and afford. Right? So if we

700
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,240
wanted to be able to uh provide

701
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,919
medicines into to these types of

702
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
medicines into the into the global

703
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,559
south, we really need these to be about5

704
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,200
to$10 per gram. And if we wanted to talk

705
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,679
about alternative proteins for food use,

706
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,880
it needs to be about $5 a kilogram. So

707
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,080
we still have a long ways to go and

708
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,320
that's where part of the opportunity

709
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,000
lies. But I think really seeing like

710
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,960
where this sort of intensification

711
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,840
allows you to do this now uh in a very

712
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,159
uh pragmatic way. This isn't the limit

713
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
though.

714
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,279
If we start to think differently,

715
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,360
remember I mentioned the biology as

716
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,840
being a core catalyst in all of this. If

717
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,440
I use the biology to my benefit and

718
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,200
think differently about the biology that

719
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,760
I'm imposing, I can actually start to

720
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,919
make further reductions. So if I

721
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,080
engineer ukareotic microbes to replace

722
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,240
the mamleian cells, I can start to get

723
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,799
rid of a lot of the high value steps or

724
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
the high high cost steps in the

725
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,640
particular production processes and

726
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,080
start to simplify this even further. So

727
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,600
how do we use holistic design that

728
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440
incorporates both the engineering and

729
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,000
the biological processes to be able to

730
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,279
reduce the overall cost and time to

731
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,360
market? Well, part of the answer is that

732
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,320
biology is now like software. So we've

733
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,679
heard a lot of talks about

734
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,120
softwaredriven manufacturing.

735
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,760
Biommanufacturing will be a biology

736
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,919
softwaredriven industry. And we're

737
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,919
already starting to see this. If I want

738
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,080
to create strains that have the ability

739
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,039
to produce particular proteins, lipids,

740
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,520
RNA molecules, I can just go sequence

741
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,679
the genome. I can read about it. I can

742
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,320
model it now. I can and I can ask

743
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,679
questions in in some AI models now to to

744
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,600
start learning about how to think about

745
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,279
that engineering. And then I just go use

746
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,760
Crisper or other gene editing tools to

747
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,400
make the changes and move on. So this

748
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,640
allows for reusable underlying parts

749
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,080
that you can start to use uh to do the

750
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,080
manufacturing. And to this end, we

751
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,440
started a consortium at MIT that's

752
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,279
really thinking about open source

753
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,919
platforms for new biologies to

754
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,320
facilitate high volume production uh

755
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,400
using these types of u manufacturing

756
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,880
hosts as well as engineering in some of

757
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,720
the quality elements that are required.

758
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Happy to chat with folks uh offline

759
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,120
about this if it's of interest. But what

760
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,039
this lets you do is now suddenly

761
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,559
simplify your manufacturing process. I'm

762
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,600
showing here three different

763
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,600
manufacturing processes that we've

764
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,760
identified you can do in six to seven

765
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,240
steps. These would normally take between

766
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,400
15 and 20 steps in commercial processes

767
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,559
today. Each of these would require a

768
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,480
different facility built in order to

769
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
accommodate them. But you can see these

770
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
all look very similar in the way that

771
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
they're sort of outlined here. And

772
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,480
that's the point. You don't worry about

773
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,799
the details, but they all look quite

774
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,200
common to each other. So now what if we

775
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,799
could put that in a box? We had an

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,039
opportunity to think about this question

777
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,960
to build an automated benchtop

778
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,440
manufacturing system that would allow

779
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,039
you to put those uh microbial systems in

780
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,400
and operate a process like the one that

781
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,320
I just showed you to be able to make

782
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,919
medicines. And we showed that in 72

783
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,080
hours we could make clinical grade

784
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,640
materials that would be sufficient for

785
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,159
you initial uh studies in the lab or

786
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,760
potentially a first in human trial.

787
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,799
We've now made lots of different

788
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,600
proteins on this same platform and you

789
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,960
can make really new new ideas come up.

790
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,720
You have a new yeast organism, you can

791
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
drop it in and you can use this as a

792
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,279
starting point. So now imagine you know

793
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
a pandemic comes and you have to develop

794
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,880
a new vaccine. We had this chance during

795
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,279
the covid pandemic to actually build a

796
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,120
new recominant vaccine candidate uh that

797
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,880
ultimately went into phase one studies.

798
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,880
It took us 30 days from the time that we

799
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,880
got the DNA sequence to having a process

800
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,559
and the materials necessary to be able

801
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,480
to uh advance that candidate forward. So

802
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,080
innovating with real speed in kind of

803
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,240
new types of small footprint

804
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,159
manufacturing is really important. The

805
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,000
user interface is also important. So

806
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,279
we've spun out a company Sunflower

807
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,279
that's advancing some of these

808
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,559
technologies and their whole mission is

809
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,120
to think about how do you make it so

810
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,880
that no one can make a mistake. Everyone

811
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,720
who has ever run a bioreactor has

812
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,039
plugged the base port in on the wrong

813
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,279
pump at some point. That just cost you

814
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,799
at least $100,000 in parts if you're in

815
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,880
a pilot facility, and it could be as

816
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,919
much as a million dollars in materials

817
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,840
when you are at scale. So, how do you

818
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
use software and good engineering

819
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,000
interfaces to allow users to to not have

820
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,279
to be experts in the manufacturing

821
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,279
process, but to be able to do these

822
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,799
things simply and as they want to? and

823
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,399
how do you allow that to then transfer

824
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,240
at scale so that it's the same

825
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,039
experience as you move from one stage to

826
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,640
the next one. They've taken and

827
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,760
demonstrated this idea that box that I

828
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,279
showed you at the benchtop. They've

829
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,679
actually now done it in a a system that

830
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,360
would fit here on the stage uh and

831
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,799
during the pandemic had a chance to make

832
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,559
some uh vaccine candidates for uh SARS

833
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:43,360
KB2. They ran a pilot scale system in an

834
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,120
office space in the Boston area, made

835
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,200
materials, and then they transferred the

836
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,520
the persons, the strains, and the

837
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,840
software to a warehouse in California

838
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,080
and made it on a system of like the one

839
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,880
that was shown here. All, you know,

840
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,159
within a couple of

841
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,840
weeks. This is pretty interesting. That

842
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,159
system that would sit here on the stage

843
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,240
could make 10 kilograms of protein per

844
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,440
year. To put that in perspective, and I

845
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
was running the numbers this morning,

846
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
herptin, which is used to treat breast

847
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,640
cancer, there's about a thousand

848
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,440
patients annually in Austria that need

849
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,480
that treatment. One system of this type

850
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,520
could provide that entire supply for the

851
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,960
country. What could you do with multiple

852
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,880
ones? Right? So, how do we think

853
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,640
differently about scale out to enable

854
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,159
wide kinds of products across a number

855
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,679
of different things? Our friends at

856
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,679
Sartorius have looked at this question

857
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,760
in terms of process intensity and CO2

858
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,240
emissions and shown that continuous

859
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,679
processing with these types of organisms

860
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,840
does allow for reduced uh equivalent CO2

861
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,399
compared to other uh compared to other

862
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,000
batchbased strategies. So suddenly we're

863
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,679
seeing that not changing just one piece

864
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
but changing the entire paradigm and

865
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,000
thinking differently about this is

866
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,799
allowing for these types of uh

867
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
transformations. And we're not the only

868
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
ones that are starting to think about

869
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,159
this. I I picked a couple of examples

870
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,039
here of other uh types of technologies

871
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,440
that are emerging uh for mRNA, other

872
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,440
ones for protein modular facilities that

873
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,919
you can stand up and build very quickly.

874
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Uh live viruses for for certain gene

875
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,559
therapies or vaccines, cell therapies,

876
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,480
all based on very similar kinds of

877
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,320
ideas. How do we intensify the actual

878
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,399
process? How do we reuse parts? How do

879
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,919
we build scale in by scaling out?

880
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,679
And so I think you know as we look at

881
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,200
what an agile and sustainable next

882
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,480
generation biommanufacturing is going to

883
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,480
incorporate it will be distinct modular

884
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,960
technologies not a plant per product but

885
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,399
a a modular technology that can make a

886
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,240
few different products a few different

887
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,640
cell therapies or a few different mrnas

888
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,640
or a few different proteins. How do we

889
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,480
think about the holistic design uh in

890
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,919
order to use the biology to our

891
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,640
advantage? I think we're going to see

892
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,799
more purpose uh towards manufacturing by

893
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,159
design in that that way. And then we

894
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,480
really have to think deeply about the

895
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,840
user experience. Software is good. It

896
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,399
helps with a lot of different user

897
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
tasks. We all know how to use our cell

898
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,440
phones. How do we build that in so that

899
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,120
it's not this complicated thing that I

900
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,840
have to like be an expert in to know

901
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,120
what what knobs to push? Uh this is

902
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,880
where a lot of the deviations in

903
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,360
manufacturing occur today and one of the

904
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,120
challenges in tech transfer. And so if

905
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,799
we look at the European bio economy, you

906
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,960
know, and this is a map that I pulled

907
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,640
that I I like because it shows where the

908
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,640
printing presses were over about a

909
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,080
hundred-year period. uh around the 15th

910
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,679
century. You can see they're highly

911
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,960
distributed, right? So this is

912
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,840
information flow. What if that's

913
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,200
medicines? What if that's food products?

914
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,360
You know, I think if we think about what

915
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,200
this means, it's decreasing the capital,

916
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,960
always a good thing. Shortening supply

917
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,279
chains and adding resiliency, reducing

918
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,720
land and resource utilization. That's

919
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,559
important here as it is everywhere. Um

920
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,559
adds new kinds of jobs that are based on

921
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,519
tech skills as opposed to, you know,

922
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,120
manual labor. Uh, and I think the other

923
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,880
advantage that's probably, you know,

924
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,240
something to unpack at another time is

925
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,480
how does this allow for better

926
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,000
efficiency in regulatory processes? If

927
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,600
you know what the manufacturing strategy

928
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,640
looks like in advance, you aren't asking

929
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,480
as many questions about it. Um, so I'll

930
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,919
stop here with just a couple of points

931
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
of homework, right? A faculty member

932
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,640
from MIT can't come to a classroom and

933
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,000
not offer a little bit of homework. Um,

934
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,840
so I'm going to give you a couple of

935
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,360
things. One, we got to dig into the

936
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,720
science of biio manufacturing. What I

937
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,960
mean by this is we have to know more

938
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,240
about how to do great manufacturing. We

939
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,600
sometimes like punt it over the fence

940
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,159
and say manufacturing is just going to

941
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,919
happen. We need to understand how to en

942
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,480
enhance the productivity for a lot of

943
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,640
these product classes. The yields just

944
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,760
have to be higher. We need new ways to

945
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,440
recover product. This is going to be

946
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,480
especially important for foods where

947
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,840
chromatography is not feasible. Um we

948
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,919
need to design these solutions with

949
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,760
sustainability in mind. We want to get

950
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,200
rid of interfaces and reduce water

951
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,120
utilization. We have to increase the

952
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
automation and predictive tools. Where

953
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,200
are ways that we can enhance that and

954
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,960
build that in um upfront and on on

955
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,640
purpose? And then I think you know this

956
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
is a little bit broader is we need to

957
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
think about ways to promote deployment.

958
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,480
We need more manufacturers operating in

959
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,840
this space. So how do we you know think

960
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,679
about organizational structures

961
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,440
differently to increase the number of of

962
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,519
small and medium enterprises. A system

963
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,279
like that one that I described you right

964
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,640
I mean ballpark I'm going to say is

965
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,880
order of magnitude like a million

966
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,960
dollars. That's a pretty low capital

967
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
barrier compared to, you know, a 50 or

968
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,280
$200 million plant to be able to stand

969
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
up. How do we get more structure, more

970
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,560
organizations participating? And then

971
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,079
what are the financial tools and

972
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,839
policies that would allow for that? How

973
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,159
do we create the pull to rebuild that

974
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,480
biio manufacturing base or to build it

975
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,359
up front? I'll stop there. I know

976
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,599
there'll probably be a couple of

977
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,119
questions. Happy to chat also and we'll

978
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,679
have some time in the workshop tomorrow.

979
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,679
But thank you all.

980
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,359
Okay, some questions. What do you see as

981
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,679
the potential role of non-farma

982
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,440
manufacturers in these supply chains

983
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,200
beyond just being customers for

984
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,599
bioproducts?

985
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,440
Yeah, awesome question. So that supply

986
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
chain that I showed you, we need to make

987
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,919
lots of proteins. We need to make lots

988
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,760
of lipids. uh and so like the

989
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,079
requirements for those to be used by

990
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,280
pharma sources aren't the same as what

991
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,800
they have to go through in order to

992
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,880
actually release their their final

993
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
product that will be used in humans. Uh

994
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,400
there are some regulations around that

995
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,480
aspect but we actually just need more

996
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,760
capability in that that area. So I think

997
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,160
a lot of what we've talked about here

998
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,760
applies uh equally well in that space in

999
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,760
addition to the applications like food

1000
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,200
and materials where you know the the

1001
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,720
regulatory requirements are a little

1002
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,440
different and a little lower than than

1003
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,760
the bioharmaceutical sector.

1004
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,880
Well, I'm going to say thank you, Dr.

1005
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,160
Love, uh, for your comments, and I think

1006
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,560
it's very interesting. I'm sure you're

1007
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,480
going to have a lot of conversations at

1008
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,480
at lunchtime. So, awesome. Thanks,
