00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,960
Thanks everyone for joining us for

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,279
today's hybrid EBM seminar. Uh we're

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,120
proud to host this one uh with women

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,360
abroad as part of their women's history

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,440
month programming. Um a bit about the

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
EBM seminar. Uh it's an interactive

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,720
meeting that focuses on critical issues

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,880
related to uh the impact of biomedical

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,760
research. Um especially as it applies to

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,840
genomics and precision medicine.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
Speakers dive into the um social

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,880
implications of their work. Who's

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,480
affected? How are they affected? and

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,719
why. The primary goal of the series is

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,559
to spark meaningful discussions and

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
encourage attendees to reflect on the

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,960
broader social impact of their work,

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,239
emphasizing both the ethical and

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
scientific importance of these

20
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,280
considerations. Now, for some background

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,960
on today's seminar, women's health

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,399
research and funding gaps and

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,559
opportunities. Despite comprising half

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,879
the global population, women's health

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,920
remains critically underfunded in

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,719
research and development. In 2020, only

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
5% of global R&D funding was dedicated

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,119
to women's health, with the vast

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,320
majority focusing on fertility and

30
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,040
cancers, leaving numerous other

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,720
conditions overlooked. This panel will

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
highlight the urgent need for a greater

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
investment in a broader range of health

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
conditions that disproportionately

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,960
impact, uniquely affect or present

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,479
differently in women including preg,

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280
polycystic ovary syndrome,

38
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,920
endometriosis, menopause and

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,759
cardiovascular disease. Our panel of

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
researchers, clinicians, and policy

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,799
experts will discuss the implications of

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,640
this uh funding gap, the barriers to

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,360
change, and strategies to drive more

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,119
impactful

45
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,200
research. Uh I we'll start our session

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,320
with uh some grounding talks from our

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,040
fantastic speakers. Uh we'll follow with

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,720
a panel discussion moderated by myself

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,600
and we'll end with a um audience Q&A. So

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
hopefully folks can uh submit questions.

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
Uh if you're in this room, you can

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,759
submit them in person via the mics. If

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,280
on Zoom. And uh we've also created an

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,160
EBM live Slack channel for folks that

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,400
are on site but can't join us uh here

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,760
and prevention particularly in

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
underrepresented groups such as women.

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,040
To this end, she has run clinical trials

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,200
examining smartphone applications,

understand sex differences in coronary

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,120
artery disease as a prognostic tool for

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,519
better predictions in

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,920
women. Uh the the paper here is um

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,560
titled using sex specific polygenic risk

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,959
to prog prognosticate coronary artery

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,760
disease in women. And our third and

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,480
final speaker is doc Dr. Irene O. Ania

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
um as the chief science officer of the

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,359

111
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,919
awareness and investment in research on

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
biological sex differences and health

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,479
conditions that disproportionately or

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
uniquely affect women. She convenes

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,440
experts work expert working groups and

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
meetings to identify strategies that

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
address persistent gaps in women's

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,840
healthcare and research translating

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,280
recommendations to uh science-based and

120
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,120
p patient centered policy solutions.

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
Irene has led the development of white

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,160
papers, healthcare road mapaps, patient

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
toolkits, clinical education materials,

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
and calls to action for women's

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,919
cardiovascular health, autoimmune

126
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,800
diseases, menopause, Alzheimer's

127
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,919
disease, HPV, and endometriosis among

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,240
other areas. Uh, it's my great pleasure

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,840
to have our um speakers give their

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
grounding talks and then we'll resume

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
our panel discussion. Well, thanks to

132
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,960
all of you for joining for this

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,199
important seminar. Um I spend a lot of

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
time thinking about pregnancy. So I'm

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,560
going to talk about um this issue from

136
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,720
that lens. Um the scope of the problem

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
is that in the United States we have a

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,160
huge issue with maternal mortality

139
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,280
that's been increasing over the past two

140
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,759
decades. And in fact um this uh sort of

141
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,800
peak in maternal mortality reflecting

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,720
more than 1,200 um maternal deaths in

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,560
2021 was due to the COVID pandemic

144
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,720
specifically. Um but the rate even as

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,240
it's come down more to baseline after

146
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,320
that is unacceptably high. And what's

147
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,039
additionally unacceptable about this is

148
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,199
that there are great disparities by race

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,160
and ethnicity among populations in the

150
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,199
United States um with black individuals

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,199
um and also Pacific Islander um and

152
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
Hawaiian individuals having more than

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,000
twice the maternal mortality rate of um

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
white and Hispanic and Asian

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
individuals.

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Um and this is not a problem we've made

157
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,160
impact on at all um over the past 10

158
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,440
years. Now there's a lot of things that

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,000
can go wrong in in pregnancy and um in

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,319
my research space I spend a lot of time

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,240
thinking about um different aspects of

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,800
this. Um during the COVID pandemic uh

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,000
our group along with Dr. Edo's group at

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,400
MGH were the first um individuals who

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,400
showed um what the response to the mRNA

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,160
vaccines were in pregnant individuals as

167
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
they were left out of all clinical

168
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,919
trials but then were uniquely

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,039
susceptible uh and died um from um

170
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,280
COVID.

171
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,759
Um preeacclampsia is a disorder of

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,479
hypertension and proteinura that affects

173
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,400
5 to 7% of all pregnancies and remains a

174
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,639
leading cause of maternal morbidity and

175
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
mortality. It also is a risk factor for

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,960
lifelong cardiovascular disease. We

177
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,639
still don't understand what causes this

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
and we don't have any effective

179
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
therapies at all.

180
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Uh still birth has also been uh

181
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,000
increasing um in the United States and

182
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,199
remains a big problem worldwide with

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,639
also marked disparities between

184
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,639
populations. Um and we've done little to

185
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:32,560
impact um this rate as well. And also

186
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:36,240
fetal anomalies are common and um access

187
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,080
to genetic testing and um prenatal

188
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,880
diagnosis remains um difficult um and

189
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,880
disperate among um different populations

190
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,360
as well.

191
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,520
So um these are some things I spent a

192
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
lot of time thinking about and using

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,080
research approaches and a lot of

194
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,160
genetics um to be looking at this but

195
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,680
also integrated with a lot of clinical

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,199
information

197
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,440
um as well as socioeconomical

198
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,120
uh and other um SDO

199
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,800
data. Now one of the problems here has

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,599
been that there really haven't been many

201
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,759
physician scientists in OBGYn. Um this

202
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,599
great article by Jackie Param and

203
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,080
several other physician scientists in

204
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,800
OBGYn shows um the dismally low rate of

205
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,800
career development awards among OBGYNS

206
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,199
and this doesn't account for the number

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,199
per specialty in any way. So at any

208
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
given time there's only been like 10 to

209
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,440
20 individuals in the entire country

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,320
with career development awards just

211
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,680
reflecting one uh way of measuring how

212
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,640
many folks there are in this space.

213
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,760
Um, overall pregnancy research has only

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,240
had 1% of all funding going to OBGYn

215
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,279
departments from all of the NIH. Um, the

216
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,440
NICD budget that largely funds a lot of

217
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,040
pregnancy research doesn't even have the

218
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,959
name women's health or um, uh, pregnancy

219
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,160
in it. It's child health and

220
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,640
development. Um and in fact with um when

221
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,720
there were an ongoing restructuring

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
conversations around the NIH they were

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,480
proposing putting all of women's health

224
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,080
and pregnancy research under the

225
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,560
Institute of Disabilities.

226
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,800
Um there has been a drastic lack of

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,360
phenotyping of obstetric phenotypes even

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,600
in large cohorts that have been created.

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,640
And because of all of these challenges,

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,000
we really don't understand fundamental

231
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,959
biology. And this field has really

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,880
lagged um many other um fields and has

233
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,279
very special considerations like

234
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
gestational age dependent um factors in

235
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,360
biology that really need to be taken

236
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
into account and without um

237
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,839
obstitricians involved in this. some of

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,399
these important aspects of this work are

239
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,519
often forgotten.

240
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,680
Um in response to some of these um

241
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,720
threats um the women's first research

242
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,560
coalition was founded um through uh the

243
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,880
American um college of um sorry American

244
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,760
gynecologic and obstetric obstitrician

245
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,240
society um and you can go to their

246
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
website um to see um what they're

247
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,560
working on but they're really working

248
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,320
for um to advocate for increased federal

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
investment in women's health research

250
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,000
especially in OBGYn but across all um

251
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,680
domains as well and doing a lot of um

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,680
education at the federal

253
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,200
level. Um here in Washington, we have a

254
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,519
great team as you heard that's

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,160
collecting biopecimens across pregnancy.

256
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,880
We have um four physician scientists and

257
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,680
another excellent PhD scientist all

258
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,279
working together. Um and if you have any

259
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,600
projects that you'd like to do with us,

260
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,519
please feel free to reach out. Um, and

261
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,480
these are the funds that we've um over

262
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,160
time been able to piece together to do

263
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
some of our work, but it remains um

264
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,959
challenging. So, thank you all for your

265
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,360
attention. Thanks so much for that,

266
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,680
Katie, um, for that wonderful um,

267
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
kickoff for us. I'm going to turn the

268
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
topic a little bit towards something

269
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,480
that's more near and dear to my heart,

270
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
pun intended, as I'm a cardiologist at

271
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
Mass General, and I'm going to talk

272
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
about the current state of affairs in

273
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,480
cardiology and the risk tools and where

274
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,000
they fail women.

275
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
These are my disclosures related to

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,680
clinical trials unrelated to the work

277
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,519
that I'm going to be discussing today.

278
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,519
Heart disease is incredibly common in

279
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,279
the US and over 60 million women have at

280
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,600
least one heart condition currently

281
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,519
today. But cardiovascular disease isn't

282
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,800
just common, it's often deadly. This is

283
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
a plot showing deaths due to

284
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,519
cardiovascular disease and both men and

285
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,360
women over time from 1900 to 2010. And

286
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,200
there's a dramatic rise in deaths with a

287
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
peak of over 1 million deaths per year

288
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
in the late 1960s. And though this has

289
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,360
improved somewhat with better screening

290
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
and treatment, mortality remains high

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
through 2020. This plot still shows

292
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,880
mortality on the y-axis, but now we're

293
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,519
splitting rates to show individual

294
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,000
curves for women in red and men in blue.

295
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,120
Notably, CBD mortality in women actually

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,200
exceeds that of men from 1984 to 2012.

297
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,360
And worse, despite the improved trends

298
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,760
of the early 2000s, mortality is again

299
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,320
rising in both sexes. It's up almost 7%

300
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,959
in women over the past decade. Despite

301
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,399
this, less than half of women in the US

302
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,480
recognize that heart disease is our

303
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,079
number one killer. And this is despite

304
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,800
efforts to raise awareness such as go

305
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,079
red for women and women's heart health

306
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,160
month. When we consider heart disease

307
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,920
risk in women as physicians, we rely

308
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
heavily on nutritional risk factors. So

309
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,279
clinical conditions like high blood

310
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
pressure, cholesterol, diabetes,

311
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,760
obesity, and lifestyle factors like

312
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,519
smoking, diet, exercise, and stress. But

313
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
it's important to note that these affect

314
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,680
men and women differently and often

315
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
portend a worse CVD risk in women. So

316
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,040
for example, high blood pressure is a

317
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,639
leading cause of cardiovascular disease.

318
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,000
While women with hypertension have a

319
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
higher population adjusted

320
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
cardiovascular mortality compared to men

321
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,600
and they're less likely to be treated to

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
guideline directed blood pressure goals,

323
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,279
further compounding their worst

324
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,200
outcomes. There are also female specific

325
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,360
biologic risk factors that we know

326
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,480
propose CBD risk. These are things like

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,000
adverse pregnancy outcomes, um, PCOS,

328
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,000
autoimmune diseases, which often

329
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
disproportionately affect women, as well

330
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,880
as age of menarchy, and menopause all

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
play into one's cardiovascular risk. But

332
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
none of these factors in pink are

333
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
included in the clinical risk

334
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
calculators. So, you can imagine it's

335
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,760
unsurprising that for a man and a woman

336
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,519
with same age and clinical risk factors,

337
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
a woman's clinical risk score is going

338
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
to be predicted to be lower than a man,

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,160
which may not truly pretend her disease

340
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,839
risk. To look for novel ways to assess

341
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,519
risk, we look at eugenomics, and this

342
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,600
holds broad appeal since they're stable

343
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,000
from early in life. Polygenic risk

344
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,760
scores work to some small risk across

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,079
several different LOSI across your

346
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,680
entire genome. Over time, we've used

347
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,760
increasingly complex computational

348
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
methods to create polygenic risk scores

349
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,480
that have really good predictive

350
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
performance across different disease

351
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,399
traits, including coronary artery

352
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
disease. All this being said, the

353
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,920
elephant in the room is that the overall

354
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
performance in mixed sex cohorts has

355
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,760
been good, but this masks their

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,079
underperformance in women compared to

357
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
men. On the right are results from

358
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
apologenic risk score called GPS small,

359
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,600
which is one of the most computationally

360
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,279
advanced apologetic risk scores for CAD

361
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
to date. You can see that in this

362
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,760
logistic regression model for CAD, the

363
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
odds ratio per standard deviation of

364
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,040
prevalent CD is notably lower for women

365
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,320
in the bottom compared to men. And we

366
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,399
looked to see whether this was still

367
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
applicable in a modern US bio bank and

368
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,199
looked in the mast Brigham Bioank um to

369
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,839
see whether or not this pattern had

370
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,440
improved over time compared to the UK

371
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:24,880
bioank. Here we're looking at GPS mulch

372
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,320
and you see that the association with

373
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,199
CED along the Y ais um is lower in women

374
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,120
in red compared to men in blue. In

375
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,880
particular, the absolute risks were

376
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,800
relatively similar at the bottom 10th

377
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,480
decile of risk, but they are deflated

378
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,560
for women relative to men in the top

379
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,880
decile. So for the same polygenic risk

380
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,040
score only 17.9% of women will be

381
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,320
predicted to have CAT compared to almost

382
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,959
30% of men. This is interesting because

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,199
the distribution and GPS melt from men

384
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,440
versus women in the mass generank was

385
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,440
similar. So this is not just related to

386
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,519
sex participation bias alone but there

387
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,199
is some biologic factor that's driving

388
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,600
the odds ratio differences that we're

389
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,920
seeing in our study. We tried to address

390
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,199
this by looking back at larger GWA

391
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,760
studies that have been conducted to

392
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,760
identify sex stratified genes that might

393
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
be able to help mitigate some of this.

394
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,600
We found 10 LOSI and created a sex

395
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,920
differential polygenetic risk score

396
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,920
called PRS sex differences. And this

397
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,240
score represents the difference in CD

398
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,240
effects in women relative to men. We

399
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
applied this back to our original model

400
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,160
using GPS null to predict cardiovascular

401
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,920
disease and saw that it did improve some

402
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
of the risk association for female

403
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,760
participants, but it didn't fully

404
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,519
resolve the disparity. And

405
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,839
interestingly, in particular for women

406
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,959
under 55 years of age, it did seem to

407
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,720
bring the the over risk prediction to

408
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,560
similar to the overall cohort level. So

409
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,800
it might be better for early risk in

410
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,759
women, which is often even lower in

411
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,800
terms of prediction for clinical risk

412
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,399
calculators. Going forward, it's

413
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,880
important to understand the full scope

414
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,800
ex of sex differences in polygenic risk

415
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,440
as well as other conditions beyond

416
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,040
cardiovascular disease to look at more

417
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
sex differential variance to be able to

418
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,040
create better scores. The to do this we

419
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,880
have to understand and address the

420
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
barriers towards improved and less

421
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,399
biased representation of women in the

422
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,480
genomic studies that are underpinning

423
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
all of these studies. And to resolve the

424
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
PRS performance discrepancies, we have

425
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,920
to create supports for their

426
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,440
participation. This may be in different

427
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,560
things such as child care,

428
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,320
transportation, flexible hours, or just

429
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,000
being more direct about making sure that

430
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,399
the proportions are similar across

431
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,160
different bio banks. Additionally, we

432
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
have to standardize the reporting of

433
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,279
different studies including clinical

434
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,839
risk calculators and polygenic risk

435
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,160
scores by sex to avoid masking some of

436
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,639
the pulled sex disparities that could

437
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,040
help um reveal the full magnitude of the

438
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,720
disparities to date. We can't fix this

439
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,560
problem without addressing it head-on.

440
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
And both policy and trial setup have to

441
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,160
directly address these issues for us to

442
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
be able to understand the biologic

443
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,320
differences that are related to sex that

444
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,839
underpin the outcome differences that we

445
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,720
currently see in common diseases for

446
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,839
cardiovascular disease and

447
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,600
beyond. With that, I'll say thank you to

448
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,920
my collaborators.

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,799
Thank you so much, Cavia. Um both

450
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,120
fantastic talks. Um and now it's uh

451
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,839
we'll end with our fi third and final

452
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,760
speaker Dr. Anin.

453
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,240
Thank you very much for having me today.

454
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm looking forward um to talking a bit

455
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
about the importance of keeping women's

456
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,319
health research um top of mind and the

457
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,039
role that scientists can play in um

458
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,960
advocacy and efforts towards increasing

459
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,000
this

460
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,200
funding. And so I'll start off with a

461
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,840
bit of a snapshot of women's women's

462
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,640
inclusion in in re in health research.

463
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,960
Within 50 years, we see this evolution

464
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,160
of women in clinical research that is as

465
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,000
early as or as recent rather as 1977

466
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,919
that there was an active exclusion of

467
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,640
women in medical research, particularly

468
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,280
women of childbearing years. And in the

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,000
'9s is when SWR was founded. I can

470
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,679
actually do my shameless plug that um

471
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,039
just a couple weeks ago we celebrated

472
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,760
our 35th anniversary as an organization

473
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,440
and our work really spun from coalition

474
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,320
building and engaging researchers in

475
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,440
policy and if highlighted here in red we

476
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,600
see um in 1993 the revitalization act

477
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
the NIH revitalization act that mandated

478
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,720
the inclusion of women in medical

479
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,200
research um and reporting sex analysis

480
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,440
in the data and the dissemination and so

481
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,679
as you can see this is about years that

482
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,760
it um 16 years that it took for a win.

483
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,080
And even if we fast forward after such a

484
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,200
policy was implemented, eight years

485
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,559
later in 2001, we see that the FDA had

486
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,679
to pull um 80% of the newest drugs

487
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,280
because they were demonstrating a lack

488
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
of understanding in their effects in

489
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
women. And we're seeing these adverse

490
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,039
effects which really caused um a shift

491
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,640
in how we approach our research and care

492
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,120
and pharmaceutical development when it

493
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,400
comes to women's health. Even another 15

494
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,640
years later is when we saw another major

495
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
policy that we celebrate in this space

496
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
where the NIH implemented their policy

497
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,840
on sex as a biological variable often

498
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
known as SABV policy which requires the

499
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
accounting for sex differences in

500
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,880
pre-clinical studies and vertebrae

501
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,280
studies particularly also in grant

502
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,880
funding but then also in those reports

503
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,799
and progress reports and that's really

504
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,120
important but even as was noted um in

505
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,000
the first talk that with the covid

506
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,840
vaccine In 2020, many years later, we

507
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
still saw that the vaccine when it was

508
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,240
released, there was not the inclusion of

509
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,160
pregnant and lactating populations in

510
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,880
those initial studies, leaving these

511
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
this demographic very vulnerable and not

512
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,919
having the information they need to

513
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,919
determine whether or not they wanted or

514
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,760
did not want the vaccine. And so, it's

515
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,840
not about I'm not here to say to take it

516
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,120
or not to take it, but we need to make

517
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,799
sure that um individuals and women are

518
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,360
completely informed and have the

519
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,400
opportunity to make those decisions. We

520
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,160
had a very big win last year um as far

521
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,240
as an executive order that President

522
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,080
Biden signed to advance women's health

523
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,960
research and a lot of federal agencies

524
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,120
took up this mantle and committed up to

525
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
almost about a billion dollars in

526
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,960
commitments to advance women's

527
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,559
healthcare um women's health research

528
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,320
and so women's health really became a

529
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,320
mainstream conversation but we still

530
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,720
have a lot of work to do and so I just

531
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,160
want to ask you just take two moments in

532
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,320
your mind and think about how much do

533
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,919
you think NIH funds in heart disease

534
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
disase research and I'll use that as an

535
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,799
example. The NIH reports funding by over

536
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,159
320 different categories and for heart

537
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,760
disease research. In 2022, it funded

538
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,080
over $1.7 billion. That's 4% of the NIH

539
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,000
budget, which is really great. But as we

540
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,480
know that um heart disease is a leading

541
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,480
cause of death in women. How much is

542
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,600
really being studied with respect to

543
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,120
women? And if you take we if you take a

544
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,400
look at all of the projects that are

545
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,880
funded over three 3,400 projects only

546
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,000
164 refer to sex and gender in their

547
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,960
titles female maternal health gender um

548
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,799
sex lactating pregnant these various um

549
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,480
uh words and combinations of these

550
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,320
words. And so while SABV projects have

551
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,760
increased in heart disease over the last

552
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,919
10 years, we still see um a very small

553
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,880
fraction of this funding going towards

554
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,039
the understanding of um women's health

555
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,919
and it's clearly not proportional to the

556
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,080
burden of disease in women and people of

557
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,720
color. And so here are some other key

558
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,799
women's health topics that were um named

559
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
prior that I just wanted to highlight.

560
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,480
as you see PCOS, endometriosis,

561
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,440
menopause, and to note that PCOS was

562
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,000
only starting to be tracked in 2022 and

563
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
in 2023 was the first year that

564
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,280
menopause was added to the list. And so

565
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,440
these are very core um topics in women's

566
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,360
health that have not been tracked and

567
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,080
have not been addressed in a in a

568
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,120
intentional way when it came to research

569
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,280
um funding and investment. And so across

570
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,159
the NIH portfolio, women's health in

571
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,080
total um still is less than 10% no

572
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,799
matter what area you are looking to

573
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
study. And so without this

574
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,760
prioritization, researchers and

575
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,480
healthcare providers won't realize the

576
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,880
needs of the vulnerable and underserved

577
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,039
populations. And we we see inequities

578
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,200
from bench to bedside. And so that's

579
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,159
where SWR Society for Women's Health

580
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,039
Research comes into play. We have a 360

581
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,280
approach I like to say for pi science,

582
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
policy and education. We convene

583
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,440
interdisciplinary networks that assess

584
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,919
persistent gaps and opportunities in

585
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,320
research barriers to clinical care. We

586
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,880
translate um these science and this

587
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,120
evidence base into advocacy efforts and

588
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,679
policy recommendations whether they are

589
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,280
regulatory or legislative. And then we

590
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,280
also look to address disparities for

591
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,039
diverse sub populations of women across

592
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,559
age, race, geography, and other um

593
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,320
diversity. Our working groups in our

594
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,440
task force and the individuals that we

595
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,120
engage um span basic clinical and public

596
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
health researchers, healthc care

597
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,240
providers, policy leaders, patients, and

598
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,400
patient advocates. And so as we as I

599
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
close out, I just wanted to mention some

600
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,280
space because of course there's these

601
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,760
gaps and the work that SWR does heavily

602
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,120
relies on scientific expertise that I

603
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,280
know is a lot of times when we talk

604
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,400
about policies and politics, there is

605
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,600
this stigma associated with them. But

606
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,280
while some advocacy is politically

607
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,360
polarized, a lot is not. In women's

608
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,679
healthc care, for example, in CBD,

609
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,360
cardiovascular disease is one of the

610
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,600
topics that can really escape this

611
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,720
pigeon hole. bone health, autoimmune

612
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,640
conditions, they are very um important

613
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,520
um health care conditions that are

614
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,000
appreciated um the research investment

615
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,840
across the aisle through in various

616
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,760
different groups. And so while there are

617
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,520
often barriers that we get from

618
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
different scientists about their

619
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,919
research is too complicated to explain

620
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,760
or there's no incentive for community

621
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,640
related outreach or there's little

622
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,440
training in science policy that there

623
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,760
are many ways to advocate many ways to

624
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,600
engage in um policy change and that

625
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,679
include here that I've listed whether

626
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
you're in incentivizing or participating

627
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,520
in research you're partnering with

628
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,279
community- based participatory research

629
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,799
efforts you're championing recruitment

630
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,080
and retention of um women and

631
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,880
underrepresented populations in clinical

632
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,799
studies or looking at exclusion criteria

633
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
and making sure that we're not

634
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,600
inadvertently excluding um various

635
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,720
populations of women that are needed um

636
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,039
to be participates in these studies.

637
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Also, there's individual engagement that

638
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,279
you can have with communications with

639
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,039
policy makers. Institutions often

640
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,159
professional societies have government

641
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,000
relations departments. There's also um a

642
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,400
lot of science policy engagement now at

643
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,760
research conferences and then individual

644
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
comments that you can take with your

645
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,120
expertise and get engaged in um

646
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,880
providing feedback or commentary for

647
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,000
different um federal and um and

648
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,559
industrybased reviews. And so with that,

649
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,440
I will say thank you and turn it back

650
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,240
over. Thank you so much. um really

651
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,559
fantastic talks uh highlighting the many

652
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,440
ways that current funding imbalances

653
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:15,520
impact um uh healthcare outcomes for

654
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,520
women in re really real ways. Um I'd

655
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,559
like to at least um kick off our our

656
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,880
panel discussion um uh with a with a

657
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,640
question for the group. um from your

658
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,320
from each of your different kind of

659
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,600
viewpoints and lenses, what are the

660
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,679
primary barriers that you see uh to

661
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,080
securing increased funding for women's

662
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,559
health research? Um and how can they be

663
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,320
addressed at um kind of individual

664
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,600
research teams uh um at institutional

665
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,840
levels and at policy levels? Also, as a

666
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,760
clinician, I think that it's really

667
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
important that we address this not just

668
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,400
at the policy level, but at the

669
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,679
individual level. Um, I think

670
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,080
participation and incentivizing and

671
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,400
creating structures for all patients and

672
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,159
all populations to equally have

673
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,880
opportunities to participate in these

674
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,559
trials so that the results are not just

675
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,320
reflective of them, but that benefit

676
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,200
their population and others who look

677
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,039
like them is really important. and be

678
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
more systematic about the way that we

679
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,840
report the findings that we understand

680
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,000
who is being represented and who we

681
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,679
still need to be better at um recruiting

682
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,720
into the different trial spaces to be

683
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,279
able to address these gaps.

684
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,279
I would add to that the recognition that

685
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,600
women's health is not just considered

686
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,000
what we would say bikini medicine and

687
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,240
that's the areas of a woman's body that

688
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,880
cover that are covered by a bikini. That

689
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,720
is whole health. We talked about um

690
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,320
pregnancy is very important, menopause

691
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,240
is very important, menstrual health is

692
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,960
very important, but so is cardiovascular

693
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,520
disease, autoimmune conditions, bone

694
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,600
health, brain health, mental health, and

695
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,279
so and liver health. And so these are

696
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,720
areas that I think challenges pigeon

697
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,039
holing women's health into a few areas

698
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,760
and not recognizing that they are all

699
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,919
very much interconnected. And even when

700
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,320
you talked about pregnancy earlier as

701
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,960
the example, it intersected with

702
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,240
gestational diabetes and preeclampsy and

703
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,559
blood pressure and all these other

704
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,679
areas. And so I think that has been a

705
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,600
major challenge of um only looking at

706
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,200
pregnancy as reproductive health. I mean

707
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,400
women's health is reproductive health

708
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,640
but even reproductive health intersects

709
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,640
whole life and whole body health for a

710
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,640
woman.

711
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,279
I'd also add to all of those um wise

712
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:38,320
comments that um you know we um need

713
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,200
folks who are staying in the game in

714
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,400
terms of like doing research and at all

715
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,799
levels. So um you know if we want to

716
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,760
promote um individuals who are focused

717
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,600
on um doing work on women's health then

718
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,960
we need to continue to provide

719
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,039
opportunities for career development. um

720
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,360
if many of these folks are, you know,

721
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,600
parents and women at their early stages.

722
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,000
We need to support folks through many of

723
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,159
those critical transitions that we have.

724
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,399
Um many people may be aware that like

725
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,360
maternity supplements just went away

726
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,080
currently. So all of these things um

727
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,279
impact the work of young investigators.

728
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,200
Um and there um needs to be

729
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,440
opportunities for actually receiving

730
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,559
funding to do this work. Otherwise, um

731
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,720
it inevitably leads to sort of um you

732
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,039
know, being frustrated and hard to

733
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,679
advance the the path if there aren't

734
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,480
funds available that um can be used for

735
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,640
this work. Thanks so much. Um three

736
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,840
really important points about um

737
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,320
increasing access to being part of the

738
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,880
the research projects um being part of

739
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,679
the data that we consider as we move our

740
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,640
our research work forward. Um really

741
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,720
important point Irene about um thinking

742
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,480
about not just the the common things

743
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,640
that we think about when we as you as

744
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,200
you I had not heard that term before

745
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,360
bikini bikini health but um not just

746
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,039
thinking about those kind of the more

747
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,840
obvious and talked about pieces but

748
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,520
really thinking about systematically the

749
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,600
um how interconnected all of these

750
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,760
pieces are when we think about women's

751
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,880
health and and Katie your point about

752
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,399
increasing access um so important uh for

753
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,640
increasing access to training programs

754
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,480
um and and opportunities to actually

755
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,640
thrive in those programs once once

756
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,440
you're in them. Um so really really

757
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,919
fantastic. Thank you. Um I'd love to

758
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,320
transition to our next question. Um what

759
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,159
role do pharmaceutical companies um

760
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,320
government agencies and private

761
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,640
investigators play in shaping research

762
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,039
priorities and how can they be involved

763
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,000
in changes in research funding models?

764
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,960
Um I can start. Um one thing that um on

765
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,279
the pregnancy side that we have noticed

766
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,640
over time is um a lack of investment in

767
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,279
industry in developing um uh therapies

768
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,159
and doing trials on patients who are

769
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,480
pregnant being concerned about um it

770
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,440
being a vulnerable period or a critical

771
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,960
period as you know these um and patients

772
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,520
are frequently left out of clinical

773
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,559
trials as we have mentioned in our um

774
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,960
beginning of the talks. And so, um,

775
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,120
there needs to be, um, pathways, um, for

776
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,399
inclusion and, um, recognition of how

777
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,559
critical it is, um, to include, um, all

778
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,039
populations, uh, women, pregnant

779
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,520
individuals, um, lactating individuals

780
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,679
in all of these pharmaceutical and

781
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,919
industry sponsored trials. Otherwise, we

782
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,080
just don't even have the data to know

783
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,320
um, how to use different um, therapies

784
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,320
and interventions.

785
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,880
I agree everything with what Katie has

786
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,480
said and I think that again the

787
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,799
structural setup of the trial is

788
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,880
critical and if you don't have in buyin

789
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,679
from the sponsor whether it's pharma or

790
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,840
the NIH or other external sponsors

791
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,080
you're not going to have the ability to

792
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,799
help provide transportation or child

793
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,640
care to be able to let you know a newly

794
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,320
postpartum mother come in to participate

795
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,159
in a study and so without that

796
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,039
structural support they're less likely

797
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,880
to be willing or able um to join and

798
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,320
then we end up disenfranchising that

799
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,799
population and not being able to

800
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,039
understand how that biology contributes

801
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,240
to the overall health of populations

802
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,880
across lifetimes.

803
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,159
And to add to that, I would say that

804
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,440
there's a there's the ability or rather

805
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,960
the they need to work together in order

806
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,519
to make sure that innovation is scalable

807
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,080
and accessible at the same time. And so

808
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,080
there's some check checks and balances

809
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,760
between the pharmaceutical companies,

810
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,080
the federal agencies or government

811
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,000
agencies, the private sector to ensure

812
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,720
that while we are also doing our best

813
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,320
science and our healthcare that it's

814
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,720
reaching the populations that it was

815
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,720
designed to serve.

816
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,120
Thank you so much. And it takes a

817
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,360
different level of research to address

818
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,200
those those gaps as well. So it's not

819
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,559
just the the physiology but we have to

820
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,399
look at the social determinance of

821
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,640
health and we have to look at the

822
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,159
implementation science portion of the

823
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,200
research.

824
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,840
Thank you. Um really all uh really

825
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,080
important points about uh ways that some

826
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,159
of these um gaps and barriers can be

827
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:26,640
addressed. So thank you so much.

828
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:28,720
Um, I'd like to uh do one more question

829
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,720
here with you all and then turn it over

830
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,039
to the audience for for questions that

831
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,279
they might have. Um, what are your

832
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,080
thoughts on how interdisciplinary

833
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,039
collaboration so uh between researchers,

834
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,039
policy makers, and advocacy groups um

835
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,760
how can that help drive increased

836
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,799
investment in women's health research? I

837
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,600
can start. I I think um we leverage at

838
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,080
SFHR our three Ps. Patients, providers,

839
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,080
and policy makers. Patients being those

840
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,559
who are receiving care. Their patients,

841
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,559
but they're also caregivers. Providers

842
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,720
are charged to study, develop, and

843
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,799
dispense the care. And so that's not

844
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,039
just the healthcare providers, but also

845
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,039
researchers are in this space as far as

846
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,679
providing care and solutions. And then

847
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,679
the policy makers are really um they're

848
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,440
key for validating priorities and

849
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,480
interventions and making sure that

850
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,760
there's eth ethical access to care. So

851
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
these are decision makers and

852
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,840
influencers and the governance society.

853
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,960
So like our ACOGs and our NAMS and and

854
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,039
those other organizations. And so each

855
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,200
perspective is really val is like really

856
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,760
valuable to make sure that our solutions

857
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,120
are relevant in each space and they each

858
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
have something to bring to the table.

859
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,880
And so I'm I'm biased because I'm in

860
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,480
that provider group being a researcher

861
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,240
and I'm sure many of you guys are as

862
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,080
well. And the reason why I say that is

863
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,919
because as researchers we often wear all

864
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,880
three hats almost every day without

865
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,000
realizing it because our peer review

866
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,399
process makes us priority policy makers.

867
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,480
We are setting priorities and we're

868
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,919
determining what is going to be funded,

869
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,919
what is going to be published, what is

870
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,840
going to be disseminated. We're often

871
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,000
patients and caregivers in our own homes

872
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,079
and lives and then we are the

873
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,320
researchers at the forefront also

874
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,040
developing these roles. So I think when

875
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,280
we start to think from that empathy lens

876
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,040
of getting it and making sure that

877
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,760
internally how are we a patient and

878
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,679
provider policy maker and then when

879
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,440
we're engaging with those and

880
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,119
collaborating that we're also respecting

881
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,560
the perspectives and the value of those

882
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,560
perspectives and what they bring to the

883
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,560
table.

884
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,679
I agree with all those things. Thank you

885
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,679
for saying that so eloquently. Um I

886
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
think you know interdisciplinary can

887
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,879
mean a lot of different things. So I

888
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,359
think within science we all need each

889
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,839
other and each other's expertise um

890
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,879
coming um together across disciplines to

891
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,480
make um good discoveries and solutions.

892
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,720
Um and then um you know increasingly um

893
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,440
I've seen mechanisms of funding that in

894
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,520
that encourage or require you to both

895
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,040
engage um uh the patient um level

896
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,079
experience um diverse perspectives um

897
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,720
and um even policy makers as part of

898
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,040
your plan. So I think um opportunities

899
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,880
like that that are structured such that

900
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,520
you're thinking about all the aspects of

901
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,240
how to really um not only do the

902
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,680
scientific discovery but also implement

903
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,640
um it equitably across populations um

904
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,320
and advance policy um can really help us

905
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,839
drive um this work forward.

906
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,680
Yeah, I think both of you have really

907
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,599
eloquently pointed out the way that

908
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,280
these are all delicately interbalanced

909
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,440
and it can be easy to stick and think

910
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,680
that you only have one hat um at any

911
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,160
given time. But I think for all of us

912
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,160
who are involved in research and looking

913
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,000
at these different conditions that

914
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,680
elevating the patient experience and

915
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
bringing it really back to that so that

916
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,240
the policy makers can see the reason why

917
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,480
this is important because it's easier to

918
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,320
see it as a face as a person as a story

919
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,640
rather than a number or statistic. And

920
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,560
so keeping that in mind and always

921
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,800
putting that at the forefront so that we

922
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,079
are focused on not just the disease

923
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,240
process but the patients who are

924
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,079
affected by the disease to to really

925
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,400
improve their outcome.

926
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,880
Thanks so much. Um really important

927
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,800
points again. Um really rich uh content

928
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,200
from each of your different viewpoints

929
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,640
and experiences in and thinking about

930
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,359
this this complicated set of questions.

931
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,480
Um, I'd love to to transition now to

932
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,480
give the our um both online audience and

933
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,640
as well as the folks joining us here

934
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,320
today um at the Broad Institute uh to

935
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,920
take a pause and and answer any

936
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,119
questions that the the audience might

937
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
have. Hi. Uh first, thank you so much

938
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
for for giving your time to come and

939
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
talk about this. Uh my name is Ashley

940
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,720
Earl. I'm a research scientist here at

941
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,359
the Broad Institute. Um I work across a

942
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,079
bunch of uh problems and infectious

943
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,839
diseases but one of them is recurrent

944
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,920
urinary tract infections which of course

945
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:06,960
disproportionately affect women and um

946
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,800
are a societal problem. Um so I have so

947
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,440
many things swirling in my mind and

948
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,440
questions and frustrations. Frankly I'm

949
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
tempted to ask about the elephant in the

950
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,359
room but I'm I'm not. I'm just gonna ask

951
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,320
something very pragmatic. So you um you

952
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,800
guys talked about

953
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,040
um how pharmacy it sounded like the

954
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,920
take-home for me is is maybe not

955
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,560
stepping up to the plate as much as one

956
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,920
would like all of us would like or need.

957
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,440
So I'm just curious what what are there

958
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,960
incentives in place to

959
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,680
get pharmaceutical companies like

960
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,359
getting this important work done? I'll

961
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,599
stick with that question for now and

962
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,760
love to hear just what I don't know much

963
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,520
about the what's going on in pharma

964
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,320
around this. So I'd love to hear a

965
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,800
little more hopefully something hopeful.

966
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,720
I will say as a um as a clinical

967
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,680
trialist that interacts with pharma a

968
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,760
lot for studies and novel drug

969
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,800
development and being able to see the

970
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,400
populations that would benefit. There is

971
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,520
not a systematic requirement for pharma

972
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,040
to implement action plans to improve the

973
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,839
involvement of underrepresented

974
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,560
minorities or women or you know women

975
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,400
plus um across the different studies.

976
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,400
And if anything it can sometimes be more

977
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,160
of a barrier for women to participate by

978
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,880
forcing them to take recurrent pregnancy

979
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,960
tests to have them sign atistations

980
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,000
about contraception which are important

981
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,079
but it makes it more challenging. Um, I

982
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,880
will say some companies have stepped up

983
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,560
more to the plate because they're aware

984
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,520
of the issue and so they've offered

985
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,960
things like ability to do visits for

986
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,640
research studies at home through

987
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,280
companies that are newly developed that

988
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,960
are trying to bring this back to outside

989
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,640
of the healthcare setting. So, it's not

990
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,359
you have to drive an hour to come to

991
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
downtown Boston to do um a trial. You

992
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,680
can have this done in your house in

993
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,599
Maine instead. So, I think having that

994
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,240
be more systematic and I don't know if

995
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,920
the best way is to highlight either the

996
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,200
ones that are doing it really well or to

997
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,640
highlight the ones that are not doing it

998
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,839
at all. Um, name or blame um either way,

999
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,240
but I I agree that

1000
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:20,440
the heterogeneity there um is an issue

1001
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,440
that we still need to address better.

1002
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,440
And on the you know it's not the fun

1003
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,000
answer but on a practical side it's it's

1004
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,480
um goal alignment right and benefits

1005
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,280
alignment. So what is important to that

1006
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,400
industry and helping them to see how

1007
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,839
your cause can benefit them. So for

1008
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,800
example, if there is a drug or

1009
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,280
therapeutic for endometriosis, well then

1010
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,040
our lead is a understanding the role for

1011
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,760
endo, understanding how it impacts

1012
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,960
women's health, understanding

1013
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,560
coorbidities. And so I want you to

1014
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,160
invest. And so that's how we can kind of

1015
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,480
drive this investment by demonstrating

1016
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,880
how great the need is in this population

1017
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,440
of women. It's not necessarily what you

1018
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,280
wish ideally to do, but when you make

1019
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,960
that case and they see that they see

1020
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,520
that benefit, that kind of turns their

1021
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
ear because, you know, seeing that they

1022
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,880
need to see that return on investment

1023
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,520
and our return on investment is health

1024
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,680
and wholeness. Katie, any additional

1025
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,680
thoughts on that question? I don't think

1026
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,920
I can say it any better than these folks

1027
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,240
have. So, yeah. And I, you know, just

1028
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,440
speaking from a personal perspective, it

1029
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,920
um uh thinking about uh women's health,

1030
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,680
I this has come up during um you know,

1031
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,680
while I was pregnant with my children,

1032
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,240
just the lack of information, concrete

1033
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,000
information that um clinicians are able

1034
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,560
to share with you when you ask a

1035
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,359
question. Um I'm experiencing that now

1036
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,280
again. um you know as I enter pmenopause

1037
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,800
and you ask very specific questions and

1038
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,359
it's not the fault of the clinicians

1039
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,440
it's just that we have not invested

1040
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,520
sufficiently to understand the

1041
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,160
underlying biology and to be able to

1042
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,319
provide answers that are adequate. So,

1043
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,640
it's just it's a it's very frustrating,

1044
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,200
but I think it is it's to the to the

1045
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,440
point about, you know, um when you're in

1046
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,440
these rooms, if you're in positions that

1047
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,800
are able to advocate for some of these

1048
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,599
changes, um uh at research institutes,

1049
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,599
at kind of the funding level, um across

1050
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,000
journals, what articles get published,

1051
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,319
what type of work is uplifted? um you

1052
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,480
know speak to that and and um really

1053
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,280
highlight it because as we all have said

1054
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,440
it's you know we're it's 50% of over 50%

1055
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,800
of the population and there's such a

1056
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,839
lack of information about um this really

1057
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,440
large group of people's um health. So

1058
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,520
just yeah wanted to share that that was

1059
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,760
one of the motivations for for kind of

1060
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,640
organizing this session um along with

1061
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,520
these fantastic panelists but um yeah

1062
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,960
these these these research decisions

1063
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,599
have real impacts and um we can all

1064
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,280
advocate for for some of this

1065
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:02,280
change. Any other questions from the

1066
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,880
audience here?

1067
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,839
Um Lois, are you are you seeing anything

1068
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:12,560
in the Zoom? Oh, sorry. Hi. Um, thank

1069
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,440
you all for uh coming out and talking to

1070
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,560
us. Um, my question is kind of similar,

1071
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,839
but um, is this disparity like we've

1072
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,400
talked a lot about the United States. Is

1073
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,000
this disparity a global issue as well?

1074
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,680
And if so, are there any countries that

1075
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,800
have like a different model that seems

1076
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,119
to be working decently well that we

1077
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,720
could like emulate?

1078
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,920
definitely global the gender health gap

1079
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,560
um we see it um at SR we've done some

1080
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,319
work with um global alliance for women's

1081
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,040
health in the UN

1082
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:54,319
um you see certain leaders on certain

1083
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,560
topics so there is some significant

1084
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,800
advance for example endometriosis

1085
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,560
another um major country is Australia

1086
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,480
that's doing a lot of work you see some

1087
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,119
stuff with Canada um uh the UK Okay,

1088
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,200
with menopause, they are, you know,

1089
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,359
leading in that area for a lot of

1090
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,880
efforts that bridge science and policy

1091
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:18,400
and healthcare access. Um, but it's it's

1092
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,280
not a a oneanddone. Um, there are some

1093
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,079
opportunities. released the Gates

1094
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,319
Foundation and NIH um released a a

1095
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,599
research um opportunities and

1096
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,760
innovations map that provided 50

1097
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,680
distinct opportunities to address

1098
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,040
women's health gaps um globally and

1099
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,119
sustainably. Um so those are those are

1100
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,680
some opportunities and areas where it

1101
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,680
has been doing well.

1102
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,720
Yeah, I'd echo those same sentiments. um

1103
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,000
you know there's huge disparities in

1104
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,160
access to obstetric care and you know

1105
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,520
most of the still births worldwide occur

1106
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,839
due to intraartum so during labor and

1107
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,880
delivery um which is not the case in the

1108
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:06,319
United States um but that is an access

1109
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,720
issue access to you know obstetric care

1110
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,599
and the ability to surgically intervene

1111
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,480
if labor is not going well so um that's

1112
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,079
just like one example um I'd highlight

1113
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:21,839
that Australia IA has had a a nationwide

1114
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,200
um uh program to um improve still birth

1115
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,640
rates in the country. So they are

1116
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,520
leading in that area. Um but again um

1117
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,440
it's like not not one and done anywhere.

1118
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,319
So

1119
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,160
yeah, I would echo it's it is not

1120
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,920
there's no perfect system. There are

1121
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,880
some countries at least for genomics

1122
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,280
that um Finland for example they have it

1123
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,119
linked to their um public health system

1124
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,800
which is when you're a closed system is

1125
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,400
a smaller country that's relatively um

1126
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,880
geographically localized they are better

1127
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,880
at capturing everybody in terms of

1128
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,280
getting some participation across the

1129
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,960
board though it's not necessarily the

1130
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,079
same depth of data for every single

1131
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,319
participant in that bio bank but efforts

1132
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,319
to do that where it's just automatic and

1133
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,119
integrated into systems of care that

1134
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,640
patients will be participating with

1135
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,280
might be a good way of helping to

1136
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,560
improve some of this. But again, as we

1137
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,920
talked about, not everyone's able to

1138
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,640
access care, especially in the United

1139
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,640
States where there are pockets of um

1140
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,720
healthcare deserts where you can't get

1141
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,319
to essential care like cardiac

1142
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,079
rehabilitation, post heart attack,

1143
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,680
things that are standard of care, we

1144
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,839
still aren't very good at delivering.

1145
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,520
So, it just adds another layer of

1146
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,440
complexity here in the US with the

1147
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,640
insurance systems.

1148
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,240
And something to consider, um, maternal

1149
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,640
morbidity and mortality was flagged as

1150
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,800
one of the Millennium Development Goals

1151
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,839
through the UN, um, a number of years

1152
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,359
ago. And so they dedicated years to

1153
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,119
improving that and there was a lot of

1154
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,040
strategy globally to address it. Well,

1155
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,520
because they were addressing it well, it

1156
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,560
was not one of the STGS per se when they

1157
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,480
um re re-uped their goals, their

1158
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,200
development goals. And so those numbers

1159
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,359
started to decline. And so that's the

1160
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,319
that demonstrates the importance of

1161
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,319
maintaining a priority area and not just

1162
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:18,160
saying we've done well for 10 years or

1163
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:20,400
15 years and and not thinking about how

1164
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,319
you really can keep it going. And so

1165
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,839
when you focus on other things, the

1166
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,319
things you were doing well now just take

1167
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,000
a backseat. And so now we're seeing the

1168
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,160
increase in the progress that was made

1169
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,160
over the previous 15 years starting to

1170
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,119
get lost again. Thanks so much. Um any

1171
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,119
other questions from the audience here?

1172
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,160
What one thing I was thinking about with

1173
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:47,560
the focus that I'm hearing on inclusion

1174
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:50,720
of of women in studies and in trials

1175
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:54,400
and since you guys have obviously done a

1176
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:57,200
lot of work relying upon these kinds of

1177
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,480
studies I know one frustration that

1178
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,680
we've had so I'm just going to throw it

1179
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,200
out there and see if there's some just

1180
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:07,040
ideas, you know, again I agree like this

1181
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,079
access to um particip ipating is a

1182
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,839
problem. I think also at least in the

1183
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,119
studies I've been involved in usually

1184
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,800
you have an anchor

1185
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:19,040
geography and you know and and people

1186
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,119
reach out right you it resonated so

1187
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,839
deeply when you have people who have

1188
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,920
these issues these illnesses and they've

1189
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,920
got literally no place to go but they

1190
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,160
read a little paper or they see a little

1191
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,319
oped and they're like you know emailing

1192
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,000
going like I'll I'm h I would love to be

1193
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,680
in your you know your study please

1194
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,400
please please and you're like sorry you

1195
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,599
live you know two states way.

1196
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:46,200
What is there has there been innovation

1197
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:49,040
around making studies more

1198
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,440
geographically disperse in a way that

1199
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,200
makes it

1200
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,960
not like a lightweight I don't even know

1201
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,720
what I'm asking just like is there a

1202
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,800
solution to this can we do multi-state

1203
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,040
multiplay studies in a lightweight way

1204
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,280
that you're aware of

1205
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,000
I think there are opportunities in that

1206
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,200
regard um you know in addition to

1207
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,640
collaborations um for our there has been

1208
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,480
I think the pandemic accelerated the

1209
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,119
some IRB's willingness to um allow us to

1210
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,119
do remote consent in many ways. So for

1211
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,280
our still birth genetics study, we can

1212
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,079
do nationwide consent in the United

1213
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,680
States. So we can take a sample and

1214
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,319
consent um somebody from from any area.

1215
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,240
um we still have a gap um given our

1216
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,119
level of funding for the project of

1217
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:42,760
actually having awareness about the

1218
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,599
study um disseminated and also um having

1219
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,240
people understand that genetics is

1220
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,400
important or could lead to important

1221
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:54,000
information. Um but um there are

1222
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,079
opportunities through um those types of

1223
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,400
consenting mechanisms where we now can

1224
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,720
enroll um more individuals.

1225
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,400
I echo that. I think that the digital

1226
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,559
health revolution that has really

1227
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,640
occurred with the pandemic forcing the

1228
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,839
hand of medicine. I mean, we rely on

1229
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,680
pagers. We're so behind the times um has

1230
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,200
really helped some of this. So, there

1231
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,520
are tech companies out there that are

1232
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,000
aiding in research. Apple, for example,

1233
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,800
has my my data counts and my accounts.

1234
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,440
And so these are opportunities that are

1235
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,000
just available by letting your iPhone

1236
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,000
send your physical activity data and

1237
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,079
some of the health information that you

1238
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
put in. And so it's very low lift that

1239
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,359
someone can opt in for these different

1240
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,880
studies, but making that

1241
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,200
more widespread and pairing that not

1242
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,359
just with here's my data, but spitting

1243
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,920
it something back out to the patient or

1244
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,280
to the um to people who are out there

1245
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,800
about these are trials that you might

1246
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,119
benefit based on the data you've given

1247
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,359
us. So making it not just a one-way data

1248
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,200
stream and empowering patients to then

1249
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,440
seek out these trials that they would be

1250
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,119
eligible and beneficial from in a

1251
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,119
geographically localized way. So you

1252
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,040
could send a nurse that's local to Maine

1253
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,200
to that person if they are identified

1254
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,720
but crucially we have to find those

1255
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,160
right people and connect them to the

1256
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,559
study and I think that's where some of

1257
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,640
the gaps still exist. Thanks so much.

1258
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,640
Really really uh great questions and

1259
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,319
um fantastic uh responses in terms of

1260
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,280
thinking about this from different

1261
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:24,880
different perspectives. Um I think

1262
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,800
another piece that comes up and uh I if

1263
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,520
to decentralize the model and have it be

1264
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,160
successful and sustainable is really um

1265
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,680
the work of uh engaging communities,

1266
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,280
educating communities about the

1267
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,520
importance of being parts of these um re

1268
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,880
uh trials and research studies and how

1269
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,920
that can benefit them and their

1270
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,280
communities in direct um measurable ways

1271
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,680
I think is also really important. So

1272
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,079
that kind of research and and um

1273
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:53,040
clinical education piece um I think is

1274
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,920
also really important. Um and we've

1275
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,880
talked a lot about um a lot of gaps and

1276
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,720
a lot of barriers, some opportunities

1277
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,680
um kind of thinking about that from at

1278
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,119
institutional levels, individual levels

1279
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,920
and kind of u policy maker and funding

1280
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,440
levels. I'd love to end with um thinking

1281
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,800
about, you know, there's a lot of folks

1282
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,960
joining us online and in this room. Um

1283
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,880
what are ways that that folks that may

1284
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,079
not be directly involved or empowered

1285
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,920
positions in the kind of research

1286
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,800
ecosystem, what are ways that um they

1287
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,160
can advance uh work that can help close

1288
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,280
some of the gaps that we've talked

1289
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,200
about?

1290
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,240
Well, I think you can always amplify

1291
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,599
science that you know is and projects

1292
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:41,680
and um uh groups that are doing this

1293
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:44,400
type of of work that you want to see. Um

1294
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,720
you know, even if you if you have

1295
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,640
influence with like some funding, you

1296
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,200
can always support these uh

1297
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,599
organizations or encourage people to um

1298
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,640
support these organizations who do have

1299
00:51:53,599 --> 00:52:00,640
um the ability to contribute um to them.

1300
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,400
Um and I think that you can um encourage

1301
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,240
you know if you're if you are in a

1302
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,520
position where you train other

1303
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,240
individuals that you um or and mentor

1304
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:14,079
them you can um you know both educate

1305
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,000
and um uh open doors to like these

1306
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,480
different opportunities and also

1307
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,119
encourage um work in this area.

1308
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,280
100% agree with that and I think that

1309
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,000
whatever you feel comfortable sharing of

1310
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,640
your journey and your experiences with

1311
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,240
research whether it's to others in your

1312
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,800
community at your place of worship at

1313
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,240
schools or even just talking about

1314
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,480
things that you know your other family

1315
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,280
members have experienced I think talking

1316
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,200
about that and the benefits that you've

1317
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,760
had with interacting with the system can

1318
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,520
make a big difference more so than

1319
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,119
hearing it from somebody like on social

1320
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,800
media that you've never met having

1321
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,440
someone in your own community talk about

1322
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,119
their experience and how they felt

1323
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,680
trusted, they felt engaged, they felt

1324
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,680
empowered by participating makes a huge

1325
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,160
difference in terms of the trust that we

1326
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,880
need to build with patients and future

1327
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,359
research participants.

1328
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,839
I think um as you touched on social

1329
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:14,480
media um it can or rather public right

1330
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,079
and sharing it with the public we've as

1331
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,559
scientists were trained to stay in the

1332
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,720
journals and there is space to get

1333
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,440
outside of the journals um particularly

1334
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,440
on the policy end of things there's

1335
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,760
actually a lot of um open comment

1336
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,920
options when for example the NICD is

1337
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,119
updating their strategic plan there's

1338
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,040
open comments so you can give your input

1339
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,920
and share your research and share your

1340
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,280
expertise in that area. And you just,

1341
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,200
you know, they have the form you can

1342
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,960
submit online when they're doing

1343
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,880
valuation um for different drugs or new

1344
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,920
therapeutics that are coming out when

1345
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,160
they're doing ratings for the US um

1346
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,040
preventive services task force. There's

1347
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,440
opportunities as individuals, as

1348
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:02,640
researchers, to to submit comments to

1349
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,040
help them navigate how they can do their

1350
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,160
research and do their review processes

1351
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,319
of different drugs and therapeutics and

1352
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,280
um and their strategic plans. So, I

1353
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,880
think engagement in that is is an

1354
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,040
individual thing. You don't have to go

1355
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,200
through an organization. You don't have

1356
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,119
to like sign up and be this. you can

1357
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,720
just share your expertise that you have

1358
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,200
and the research that you've done in a

1359
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,400
very um intentional way. Thank you so

1360
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,720

1361
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,359

1362
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,960
your presentations and your insights uh

1363
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:39,839
in our panel and um audience Q&A. I

1364
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,640
really appreciate you all um joining us

1365
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,400
for this important conversation. Um, as

1366
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,640
as we mentioned, you know, I think we

1367
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,000
all can play a role in and keeping this

1368
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,880
conversation going and and really um uh

1369
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,400
uplifting the need for increased uh

1370
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,680
funding, increased um uh research agenda

1371
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,800
focus on a lot of the complex health u

1372
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,200
women's health um uh areas that we

1373
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,680
talked about today. Again, a huge thank

1374
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,359

1375
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,040

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:14,160
folks joining us today, both in person

1377
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:17,599
