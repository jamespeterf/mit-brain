00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,280
Hello everyone. I'm Jeff Felgo,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,240
co-founder and CEO of Get

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:17,119
Intro. And if any of you like myself

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,920
have um ever done any sort of um

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,680
business sale or partnership deal, um

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,680
you know that having a personal

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,560
relationship makes everything easier.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,640
Um, we're building on that truism to

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,079
create valuable business connections

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,040
through warm

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,840
introductions. The problem that we're

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,879
solving is that for sales teams, the the

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,719
vast majority of leads that sales teams

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,680
work on uh are never going to go

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,079
anywhere. They um they just don't close.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,800
Why is that? Well, sales teams are using

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
tools like LinkedIn um to do

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,440
prospecting. They may be enriching leads

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,440
with tools like Apollo and and others

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,359
and and they may just be um searching

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
around the web looking for signals to

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,000
try and figure out um who might be a

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
valuable prospect for their company.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,200
What does that result in? It results in

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,439
a huge top off of funnel, lots and lots

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,720
of leads that are just not going to

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,640
close. And those leads get worked for a

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,040
very long period of time. Um, in

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,040
verticals like healthcare, the average

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,960
sales cycle of selling technology into a

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,840
healthcare organization is up to 19

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,920
months. So imagine sales teams spending

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,920
all this effort on leads that just

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,600
aren't going to close for months and

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,240
months. The end result, unfortunately,

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,320
is low conversion rates and we have um,

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
as I said, long sales cycles, massive

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,759
effort by sales teams and um, the

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,640
results just don't show. There is a

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,840
better way. Um, we believe that having

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,360
an AI agent that introduces sellers to

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,920
prospects who are both receptive and

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,560
reachable is the right solution. So

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,960
imagine a top of funnel, a top of a

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,159
salesunnel that is much narrower, much

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,280
more focused with accounts that are

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,120
actually interested in the offering that

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,040
is being um being pitched with folks um

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,560
that are also going to be um ready to um

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
ready to receive the information that

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
you're um that you're sharing with them.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
And it's not just about being receptive.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,680
Are they actually reachable? So, are

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,720
there um are there connections into

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,800
these key decision makers and can those

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,319
folks actually be found both offline and

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,239
online? And then having all of this

58
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,640
information automated through an agentic

59
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,640
AI

60
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,920
process. Where things really get

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,000
interesting though is when you start

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,800
thinking about enriching the data with

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,720
vertical specific information. We are

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
focusing on the healthc care vertical

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,239
and we're building the world's best

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,160
healthcare enrichment data. This data um

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,159
is being structured based on the

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,319
conversations we've had with hundreds of

69
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,480
healthcare sales executives and the

70
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,640
types of things that they look at today

71
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,480
from um what is the tooling that is

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
being used today within these buying

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,720
organizations all the way down to things

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,159
like um where are people attending

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,720
certain conferences. This information

76
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,640
enriches the um data that is available

77
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,400
for the agent to be able to find those

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,760
right people who are

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,239
reachable. So how does this look today

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,280
in our application? Well, it's really

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,120
simple. You simply describe the types of

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,519
customers, partners, and um other folks

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,640
that you would like to reach in natural

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,480
language. The system searches out across

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,080
your network and your team's extended

86
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,519
network, finding those people who are

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,239
going to be interested in what you are

88
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,239
talking about. And not only interested,

89
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,720
they're reachable through somebody in

90
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,280
your extended

91
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,480
network. And then once um that pathway

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,879
has been selected, we go ahead and build

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,720
out the communication stream reaching

94
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:14,560
out, gathering um interest from that end

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,560
person and facilitating the

96
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,320
introduction. Let's look at a real

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
example. Today we're working with a

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
business-to business startup networking

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,560
hub in Boston called Venture Lane, which

100
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,199
has approximately 75

101
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,800
startups. 150 of those members on our

102
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,040
platform share a network of over

103
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,440
250,000 people. That's a network that's

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,840
reachable by any one person within the

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,919
community through our platform. What

106
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,960
does that equal in terms of actual

107
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,520
introductions? Around 500 introductions

108
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,840
per month. All of this is extremely

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,400
valuable to a young startup company

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,919
that's trying to reach the right

111
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,199
customers. One of the business founders

112
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,840
um just told me the other day that 75%

113
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,759
of his current business comes through

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,360
warm introductions and he's doing this

115
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,199
in a very manual process today. He is so

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,440
excited to be on our platform because we

117
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,520
are automating a process that he knows

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,919
delivers business results

119
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,160
today. So what are we looking for? Um,

120
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,440
we're looking for partners who share our

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,840
vision that these types of relationships

122
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,919
drive business results. If this sounds

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,720
interesting to you, please scan the QR

124
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,440
code and sign up for our weight list.

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
We're currently taking um companies who

126
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
are interested in um being early

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,120
customers on our platform. Specifically,

128
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,720
we're looking for customers um um that

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,960
are selling into the health care

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,759
vertical today um specifically into

131
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,880
provider organizations and who believe

132
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,120
in the value of relationshipbased

133
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,759
sales. An added bonus would be if you

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,520
have a sales team that has a strong um

135
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
point of view on the types of sales

136
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,360
signals that you find most valuable in

137
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,360
bringing um in those business sales. So,

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,919
thank you very much. we're in the other

139
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,680
room and have a a table. Please come um

141
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,840
more. Thanks very much. Thank you, Chef
