1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,000
Uh, good morning. My name is Jim Flynn

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,840
and I am a program director with MIT

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,599
corporate relations and I'm delighted to

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,640
welcome you here and there's been some

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,840
question on the name of of this but it's

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,880
uh essentially

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,080
AI unleashed scaling and securing the

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,160
autonomous intelligence.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,440
So, uh, as we've seen over the last, uh,

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,480
year or two that AI has moved from

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,440
systems that simply answer prompts and

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,840
do some interesting things. Increasingly

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,440
now, what we're seeing as the future is

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,840
that these AI systems are turning into

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,239
autonomous systems that can actually

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,719
initiate, coordinate, and complete

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,160
transactions, other tasks, making

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,480
decisions on their own. So that brings

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,400
up a whole host of questions when it

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,799
comes to security, transparency, trust,

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,720
and coordination. And that's why we

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,159
wanted to wanted to have this

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,159
conversation here this
