1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,199
okay so we are going to dive in today

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,279
and talk about uh where demand curves

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,199
come from the motivation for the last

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,279
couple lectures was that we showed you a

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,240
demand curve and a supply curve and I

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,320
promised I tell you what the basis for

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,000
those demand Supply curves are the last

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,880
two lectures we started building that

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,399
basis and today we'll show you where

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,440
demand curves actually come from so

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:40,239
let's actually derive let's start by

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,239
actually deriving a demand curve okay so

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,800
deriving a demand

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,800
curve okay so

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,120
um basically theand curve as we said in

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,640
the first lecture is the relationship

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,079
between from the price charged for a

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,320
good and the consumer's desired quantity

19
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,840
of the good so what we'll do is return

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,640
to the example before and show you where

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
that comes from so remember the example

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,840
before remember we utility function

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,600
which was the square root of s * C

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,320
slices times cookies okay we had a

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,280
budget constraint which was Y is equal

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,360
to the price of slices times the number

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
of slices plus the price of cookies

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,920
times the number of cookies and we

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,520
assume to start that y was 24 the price

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,320
of slices was four and and the price of

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,680
cookies was

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,560
two okay so how do we derive a demand

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,680
curve Step

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:49,200
One is we solve for we solve for optimal

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,119
consumption solve for for SAR C star

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
stop solve for the the optimal

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,320
consumption pair how do we do that well

38
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,280
as we said last time constrained

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,640
optimization are the point where you can

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,920
the highest difference curves you can

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,280
reach given your budget constraint leads

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,000
you to set

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,239
mrss equal to

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,360
mrrt that's the tangency condition

45
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,720
that's the point where you're as well

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,840
off as possible remember it's marginal

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,440
thinking in economics it's the next unit

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,680
you want to consume pizza and cookies

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,760
until the next unit makes you as happy

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,959
as the price the market charges how

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,599
happy does it make you well that's your

52
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,959
margin rate of substitution that's minus

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,599
s over C what is the market charge well

54
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,120
that's minus the price ratio which is

55
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,120
minus a

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,280
half okay so basically we derived that

57
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:47,080
last time or uh yes we derived that two

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,159
times ago that is the constrained

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,319
optimization now we then or last time

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,560
now but we go to the next step now which

61
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,840
is would say well what does that imply

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,920
for optimal slices and cookies well we

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,680
just plug that into the budget

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,120
constraint we have we have this equation

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,720
which is one equation in in uh two

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,599
unknowns we also this equation which is

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,159
that

68
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,920
24 equals 4S + 2

69
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,080
C so now we have two equations and two

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,040
unknowns okay we know how to do that

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:26,360
okay and we solve that we get that c

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,200
star equals 6 and S star equals 3 we

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,360
just solve those two equations and two

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,159
unknowns and then we get

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,360
C star is six n s star is

76
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:40,439
three okay so that is

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,599
Illustrated in the top panel of figure

78
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,920
one uh in the future let's not make it

79
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,200
so compressed more I'm I'm okay with

80
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
killing a few more trees to make sure

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,439
our fine students don't have to hurt

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,000
their Vision okay so basically that is

83
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,480
if you look at in figure 41 at the very

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,360
top you look at budget constraint one

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,319
okay that is our original budget

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,000
constraint we just had you and the

87
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,640
tangency the Alum point is at Point a

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,200
you want six cookies and three slices of

89
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,879
pizza okay this is reviewing what we did

90
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,159
before questions about that though

91
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,760
because this is some math you're G have

92
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,840
to do over and over and over again till

93
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,600
you're sick of it questions about

94
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,440
that okay so now let's ask what happens

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,240
if the price of cookies

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,639
changes what happens if the price of

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,320
cookies Rises to Rises to three so let's

98
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,160
say the price of

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,080
cookies goes from two to

100
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,639
three well the new slope of the budget

101
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,960
constraint is now instead of minus one2

102
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,240
it's minus 1/3 so un optimization

103
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,479
problem is set Min - s over c equal to

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,360
minus 13 not minus

105
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:59,840
one2 your budget constraint is now

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:02,000
24 = 4S + 3 C

107
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,919
once you have two equations in two

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,280
unknowns you've solved that and you get

109
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:11,280
that c star equals 4 SAR equals

110
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,680
3 okay yeah question speak up so

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,800
everyone can hear

112
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,160
you oh uh negative s over C I'm sorry

113
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,160
what is your

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,800
question is it

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,000
negative uh did I do that wrong

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,639
yes you're right my bad neg3 over4 I

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,960
should never do that with look at my

118
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,360
notes good catch neg3 over4 okay so you

119
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,520
solve that and you end up getting the

120
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,240
optimum of cookies is four Optimum slice

121
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,240
of pizza is three that is point B on the

122
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,479
top

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,800
diagram how did we get there well

124
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,680
mathematically I showed you subject to

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,919
one mathematical mistake I showed you

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
how to get there graphically how do we

127
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,639
get there well we draw the new budget

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,919
constraint

129
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,280
bc2 okay and we find the tangency

130
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,680
between the indifference curve and that

131
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,360
new budget constraint bc2 offers a

132
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,120
smaller opportunity set as we discussed

133
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,800
last time so you'll end up with fewer

134
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Goods you have a smaller opportunity set

135
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,319
and you do you end up with the same

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,160
amount of pizza but with fewer

137
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:29,280
cookies likewise what if the price of

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
cookies fell to 4/3 what if the price of

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,720
cookies

140
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,720
went from 2 to

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,720
4/3 well once again you could do the

142
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,800
math and you'll find that basically when

143
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,000
you do that you're going to want three

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,560
slices and nine

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,840
cookies and graphically you can see that

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,080
that's a outward shift in the budget

147
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,160
constraint to

148
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,240
bc3 that's the rightmost budget

149
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,759
constraint your indifference curve is

150
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,560
tangent with that budget constraint at

151
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,120
nine cookies and three slices

152
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,840
pizza so what's happening here we are

153
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,680
shifting the price of cookies and

154
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,960
showing you based on tools you've

155
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,240
learned how that impacts how many

156
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
cookies you want how many slices you

157
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,639
want in other words we're drawing the

158
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,840
demand curve look at the translation

159
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,280
from the top figure to the bottom figure

160
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,759
the bottom figure has on it cookies on

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,280
the x- axis and the price of cookies on

162
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,960
the y- axis well that's a demand curve

163
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,840
we've just drawn it I've just shown you

164
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,360
for three different prices of cookies

165
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,960
how many different cookies you

166
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
want so we are we have now derived the

167
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,520
domain curve we derived the domain curve

168
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,960
by op by optimizing your utility at

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,240
different prices and finding which

170
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
quantity you want at each of those

171
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,240
different prices and that's the demain

172
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,159
curve it's the quantity you want at each

173
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,479
price so that's where the demain curve

174
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:57,280
comes

175
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,280
from okay yeah

176
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
number

177
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,840
of great point someone noticed and that

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,039
as we varied the price of cookies the

179
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,400
number of slice of pie did not change

180
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,319
that is not a general law that is a

181
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,520
specific feature of this utility

182
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:20,440
function in general when you change one

183
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,680
price both Goods will change what's nice

184
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,080
one reason we use this convenient

185
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,440
utility function is has some nice

186
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,240
mathematical properties and one is it

187
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,440
makes life easy by having the slice of

188
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,759
pizza stay the same the price so

189
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,320
essentially what we're saying here is

190
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,599
that we have for pizza we have what we

191
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,599
call a flat price consumption curve okay

192
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,360
which is BAS a cross price consumption

193
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,440
curve which is basically when the price

194
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,519
of one good changes the demand for the

195
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,600
other good doesn't change and that's

196
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,560
just a feature of this particular

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,560
utility function but it's not

198
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,279
General

199
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,279
okay now in fact you could yeah go

200
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,240
ahead the margin exactly so I I skipped

201
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,680
a step which is defining the mrss I

202
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,519
defined that last time or two time I

203
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,920
don't remember two times ago I think the

204
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,360
mrss is remember the the M negative of

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,240
the ratio of the Marge utility of

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
cookies to Mar utility of pizza okay and

207
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,519
that's minus that so so what the way we

208
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,959
got this we did two lectures ago we

209
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,480
basically uh uh took the derivative of

210
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,279
the utility function first with respect

211
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,760
to cookies then with respect to Pizza we

212
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,839
got the two different margin utilities

213
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,600
and then we took the ratio that gives

214
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,000
the margin rate of substitution all

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,920
right good question good to clarify

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,160
where that came from so this is building

217
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,440
on the work we did two lectures

218
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,440
ago other

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,320
questions okay so that is where demand

220
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,800
curves come from fun exercise at home do

221
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,360
the same exercise changing the price of

222
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,360
pizza do the reverse exercise you will

223
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,560
find as well there's a flat there's no

224
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,079
effect the number of cookies but you

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,839
will find effect on the number of slices

226
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:04,279
of pizza and you can show how that will

227
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,079
how that'll vary okay now now that we

228
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,760
know what demand curves are I want to

229
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,320
talk about what do they look like let's

230
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,959
talk about the

231
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,880
shape of demand curves what drives what

232
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,600
they look

233
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,640
like okay and what drives what demand

234
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,600
curves look like is going to be what we

235
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,240
call the elasticity of

236
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,680
demand okay the elasticity of

237
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,440
demand Epsilon is going to be the

238
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:36,720
percentage change in quantity Delta Q

239
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:39,720
over Q per percentage change in price or

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,360
a continuous time DQ

241
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,959
DP and basically we're gonna we're going

242
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,040
to generally work in discrete space but

243
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,440
the math you can do continuously I I

244
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,800
write it both ways because you're G to

245
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
the examples we'll use will sort of do

246
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,200
in discrete space it's a little easier

247
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,519
to see it but basically it's the

248
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,519
derivative of the quantity with respect

249
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
to the price it's the percentage change

250
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,000
in quantity with respect to price okay

251
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,959
so approximately equals approximately

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,680
equals the

253
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:10,040
derivative okay so basically that is the

254
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,480
elasticity of demand this tells you how

255
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
responsive people's demand is to the

256
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,240
price they have to

257
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,680
pay once again I find it very useful to

258
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,680
fix ideas in this class to think about

259
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,519
extreme cases that never exist in

260
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,920
reality but can help you understand the

261
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,639
intuition so let's look at figure

262
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,480
42 figure 42 would be a case of

263
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,160
perfectly inelastic demand that that

264
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,079
would be

265
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,800
Ada equals z that we call perfectly

266
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,040
inelastic demand that's a vertical

267
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,279
demand

268
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,760
curve in this case demand does not

269
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:48,000
respond to

270
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,639
prices okay can anyone think of a good

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,240
that even could come close to a

272
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,440
perfectly in AAS demand or feature even

273
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,000
features of a good yeah like

274
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,760
what gas gas would be well it's you're

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
right in the sense

276
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,480
it's a very interesting example in the

277
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,160
sense it's sort of inelastic because

278
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,360
like you got to get to work on the other

279
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
hand there's a bus there's your bike you

280
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,760
could walk you could buy a new car so

281
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,880
it's not perfectly an elastic but it's

282
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,839
it's somewhat what else

283
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,760
yeah water would be something uh but

284
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,279
once again not perfectly because like

285
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
you can drink Coke you can drink juice

286
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,160
you can drink other things you're on the

287
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,160
right track yeah insulin is the classic

288
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,720
example we use okay there's no

289
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,399
substitute when you're having diabetic

290
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,160
you know when your diabetic trauma for

291
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,720
insulin uh you will not say you know

292
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,519
it's a buck more I'm just going to die

293
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,839
okay uh it is uh we think it's fairly

294
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,959
now it's not perfectly nothing's

295
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,279
perfectly in elastic at some point if

296
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,839
insulin was a million dollars you might

297
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,600
just not buy it because you can't afford

298
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,120
it but it's certainly locally

299
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,000
inelastic okay so that be an example of

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,839
kind of but once again these are great

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,199
examples of things which the examples

302
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,079
we're given are Goods which should be

303
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,839
somewhat inelastic but not perfectly

304
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,839
okay likewise in figure 43

305
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
we consider a good with perfectly

306
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,839
elastic demand which is Epsilon equals

307
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,760
negative

308
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:12,360
Infinity perfectly elastic demand that

309
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,320
is any infinite tmal change in price

310
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,480
causes an infinite change in

311
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,839
quantity once again doesn't exist in

312
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,600
reality but what types of goods would

313
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,519
have very very very elastic

314
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,800
demand

315
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,320
yeah luxury goods would have elastic

316
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,880
demand because basically you know you

317
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,800
don't really need them them what

318
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,360
else

319
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,160
yeah yeah so McDonald's versus Burger

320
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,959
King okay now we may have our

321
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,240
preferences but the bottom line is

322
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,399
McDonald's charged twice as much as

323
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Burger King for a burger everyone just

324
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,440
go to Burger King okay basically it's

325
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,279
there is it's there there's a point at

326
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,680
which uh there're so and essentially

327
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,440
what is a

328
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,240
question oh no we're we're good examples

329
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,120
but here's the key

330
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,079
feature that differentiates elasticity

331
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,880
it's

332
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,880
substitutability Goods with no

333
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,600
substitutes are not

334
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,680
elastic Goods with lots of substitutes

335
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,120
are very elastic that's why I

336
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,680
immediately respond to gas by talking

337
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,440
about all the that's so embedded in my

338
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,279
brain that when someone brought off gas

339
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,880
what did I go to I went to all the

340
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:26,560
substitutes because more substitutes

341
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,880
there are the more elastic the good is

342
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,120
okay so basically you that's essentially

343
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,079
how to think about elasticity think

344
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,880
about

345
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,240
substitutability okay the degree of

346
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,880
substitutability is the degree of

347
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,040
elasticity and obviously everything in

348
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,240
the world is going to lie between these

349
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,279
two extremes there's nothing in the

350
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,120
world that's ever purely inelastic and

351
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,920
purely elastic but things are going to

352
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,519
lie between these two extremes and the

353
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,000
where they lie will be a function of how

354
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,399
substitutable they

355
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,959
are okay questions about

356
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:00,199
that now let me make a point that we are

357
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:03,880
going to um in this class um uh once

358
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:06,680
again be cheating a little bit about uh

359
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,800
linear versus nonlinear demand curves a

360
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,680
constant elasticity demand curve would

361
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,560
have to be

362
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,279
nonlinear you should if you don't see

363
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,800
that right away it's something you

364
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,519
should go home and think about a

365
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,320
constant elasticity but we're going to

366
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,680
we're going to talk about curves we're

367
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,560
going to talk about one elasticity and

368
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,720
draw linear curves so once again just

369
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,360
think is very local approximations so

370
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
it's approximately right okay so don't

371
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,160
get too thrown off by the nonlinear

372
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
linear part of this stuff and once it's

373
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,560
unclear

374
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,560
ask

375
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,639
yeah no it's it's it it's the it's the

376
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,000
elasticity it's how much a change

377
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,000
incremental change in price changes

378
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,240
quantity okay so now now let's talk

379
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,880
about another topic which is we've

380
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,399
talked we remember we talked about what

381
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,920
moves budget constraints we talked about

382
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,680
prices changing income changing so let's

383
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,160
talk about what happens when to demand

384
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,040
curves when income

385
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,040
changes income and demand

386
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:21,880
curves okay so now let's go to figure

387
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,880
44 once again we start at Point

388
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,720
a that is our original setup with the

389
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,160
budget strength 24 equal 4S + 2 C and

390
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
the utility function unal square root of

391
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,920
c and that gets a solution at Point

392
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:41,160
a okay now imagine that your income

393
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,160
rises from $24 to

394
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,279
$32 nothing else has changed your

395
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,759
preference is the same price is the same

396
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:52,240
but your income has risen from $24 to

397
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:55,880
$32 well in that case the

398
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,399
optimization is now you're still you're

399
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,440
you're still setting minus s over C

400
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,280
to a price ratio okay you're still

401
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,640
setting s over C to the price ratio

402
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,720
minus one2 that hasn't changed because

403
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,319
the price ratio hasn't changed and your

404
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,360
preferen haven't changed what's changed

405
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,919
is the second equation which your bud

406
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:20,799
rate is now 32 equals 4S plus 2

407
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,319
C so the tangency condition hasn't

408
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,720
changed which change R goes up is the

409
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,360
budget constraint and we solve for that

410
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,919
you'll now see you get that c star

411
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:34,360
equals 8 and SAR equals

412
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,720
4 so you changed your consumption but

413
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,320
not because price have changed you're

414
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,000
richer you want more that is exactly

415
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,640
what we see in at point

416
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,720
B point B shows remember when your

417
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,679
income goes up there's a parallel shift

418
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,880
outward in the budget constraint income

419
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,480
goes up parallel shift outward in the

420
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,480
budget constraint you still want to find

421
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
the tangency that tangency is still

422
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
going to solve this condition because

423
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,320
prices and preferences have haven't

424
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,360
changed it's just going to be a higher

425
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
quantity and that's what happens at

426
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,799
point

427
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,440
B same tangency at a higher quantity

428
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,720
likewise at Point C we show what happens

429
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,320
if your income Falls to

430
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,919
$16 then you want less pizza and fewer

431
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,520
fewer less pizza and fewer cookies four

432
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
cookies and two

433
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,679
slices what is that lead us to that

434
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,280
leads us to a relationship now between

435
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,440
your income

436
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,960
and the quantity demanded and that

437
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,480
relationship is shown in the second

438
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,960
panel of figure 44 we call this the

439
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,960
angle

440
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,679
curve the angle curve which is the name

441
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,720
for the relationship between income and

442
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,159
quantity demanded and you can draw an

443
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,159
angle curve for S and an angle curve for

444
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,960
C here we're drawing the angle curve for

445
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:58,120
C okay and the Ang the angle curve the

446
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,240
slope of the angle curve is what we call

447
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:07,400
the in elasticity of demand or

448
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:12,480
gamma which is Delta Q over Q over Delta

449
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:16,120
y over y or approximately DQ

450
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,159
Dy okay so

451
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,640
basically this is instead of how does

452
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,000
demand change with price which is the

453
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,600
demand curve this is how does demand

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,280
change with income or what we call the

455
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,320
angle curve

456
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,440
Okay so

457
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,840
now and we're going to come in a few

458
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,440
minutes about why this is important but

459
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,520
let's talk about the properties of

460
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,200
gamma okay gamma is much more

461
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,840
interesting than Epsilon Epsilon you

462
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,039
know some negative number zero to minus

463
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,039
infinity gamma can have a much larger

464
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,360
range in fact gamma is usually greater

465
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,120
than zero in fact when gamma is greater

466
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,600
than zero we call them normal

467
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,880
Goods normal Goods goods are Goods where

468
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,919
gamma is greater than

469
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,559
zero but gamma does not have to be

470
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,120
greater than zero well Epsilon has to be

471
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,400
less than or equal to zero gamma does

472
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,559
not gamma could actually be less than

473
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,760
zero does anyone know how that could

474
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,480
happen how could it happen that you get

475
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,559
richer and want less of something what's

476
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,640
an example yeah it's what's what's

477
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,640
called inferior good okay but give an

478
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,640
example

479
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,120
right right exactly so as you get richer

480
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,120
you want to get rid of things that you

481
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,640
only eating because they were cheap

482
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,960
what's an example of that yeah Ramen is

483
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,000
the example of that Ramen is the

484
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,400
ultimate inferior good no one wants to

485
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,120
eat ramen I realize there's fancy Ramen

486
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,559
restrant but you know nobody should go

487
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,640
there okay people want to eat R people

488
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,039
eat ramen because it's cheap okay no in

489
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,520
all seriousness it is sort of amazing

490
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,280
that Ramen is become sort of a

491
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,159
restaurant food after all you know it is

492
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,919
in other countries I realize but most

493
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,440
consumption of ramen is done by she pack

494
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,440
it to the supermarket okay as you get

495
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,760
richer you consume less Ramen you might

496
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,039
not consume zero you might still like it

497
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,280
but you're not need it five days a week

498
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
like when you're starving you know

499
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,279
entrepreneur trying to make your own

500
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,440
business okay so Ram is example of an

501
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,279
inferior good a good that as you get

502
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,000
richer you have less of it because

503
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,960
basically you're only eating it because

504
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,600
it was

505
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,799
cheap okay now even within normal Goods

506
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,159
we have a distinction which is within

507
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,559
normal Goods we distinguish between two

508
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,600
things which gamma greater than one and

509
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,720
Gamma less than

510
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,360
one what do you think we call Goods with

511
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,919
gamma greater than one versus gamma less

512
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,360
than one and this relates to examples

513
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,960
that were given

514
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,760
before yeah or which

515
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,679
one greater than one so basically luxury

516
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,960
goods are where as your income Rises the

517
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,559
percent of your income spent on the good

518
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,400
goes up let's be very clear as your gun

519
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,919
Rises you consume more of everything

520
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,520
generally

521
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,400
but it's how does the budget share

522
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,039
change do you spend more and more of

523
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,440
your budget on that good as you get

524
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,559
richer and that's what we call a luxury

525
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,559
good so a classic luxury good would be

526
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,600
eating at restaurants when you're

527
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,520
poor you have to buy you have to make

528
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,520
your own dinners because eating

529
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,600
restaurants too expensive as you get

530
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,679
richer a larger and larger share of your

531
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,880
budget will be consumed by eating at

532
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
restaurants okay that's a luxury good

533
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,440
what about Gamma less than one what we

534
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,440
call that

535
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,200
anyone got any ideas gamma less than one

536
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,880
yeah what

537
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,000
then no GI and good is well that we'll

538
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
come back to that gamma you're you're

539
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
one step ahead gamma less than one

540
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,520
simpler than that so if these are

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,159
luxuries what are

542
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,919
these

543
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,919
Necessities sorry for the small

544
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,039
writing Necessities these are Goods

545
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,039
where as your income goes up you don't

546
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,919
have less of them Ramen is an inferior

547
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:05,440
good you literally have less Ramen but

548
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,640
this is like eating at home eating at

549
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,559
home you don't necessarily you don't eat

550
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,159
spend less on eating at home as you get

551
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,799
richer but you might spend a lower share

552
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,120
or this could be clothes or this could

553
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,320
be

554
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,919
rent things where if I get rich you get

555
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,480
a nicer apartment but if you get really

556
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
rich you know when you're poor your

557
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,720
apartment's 60% of your income when

558
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,720
you're rich it's going to fall yeah

559
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,840
more than zero exactly exactly it's less

560
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,679
than one but more than zero that's a

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,000
great Point these are both greater than

562
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,600
one this is less than one but greater

563
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,760
than zero if it's less than zero it's

564
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,960
inferior so that's the interesting

565
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,159
distinction between necessity inferior

566
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,760
let me explain this very clear inferior

567
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,320
is it's very unclear I mean inferior is

568
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,080
as your income goes up you literally

569
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,400
have less of it necessity as your income

570
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,320
goes up you have more of it but it goes

571
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,760
but it rises F slower than your income

572
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,320
so rent is the perfect example richer

573
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,559
people have nicer Apartments than poorer

574
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,279
people but richer people spend a smaller

575
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,400
share of their budget on apartments than

576
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,559
do poor

577
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,679
people okay it's a necessity richer

578
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,880
people have nicer watches than poor

579
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,760
people and it's a rising share of their

580
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,760
budget as they get richer because they

581
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,919
don't have a nice watch when they're

582
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,880
poor and as they get rich they buy nicer

583
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,240
and nicer

584
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
watches okay

585
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:30,200
yeah we're going to do that in one

586
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,799
minute other questions

587
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,760
okay these are The Primitives that allow

588
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,919
us to go on to do um the fun the the

589
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,960
sort of fundamental goal of this lecture

590
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,640
which is to get into

591
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,880
behind the mechanics of what happens

592
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,559
when you change prices did everyone get

593
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,320
this can I put this

594
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,279
up okay what happens what's the

595
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,440
mechanics of what happens when you

596
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,880
change

597
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,159
prices now you said you say John you

598
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,320
just showed what happens when you change

599
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,320
prices the price goes up people want

600
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,640
less of it the price goes down people

601
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,080
want more of it you derive the demand

602
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
curve let us go a half hour early and I

603
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,159
say no I will not let you go a half hour

604
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,039
early because there's actually a very

605
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,520
important underlying mechanics going on

606
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,120
when the price changes and this

607
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,200
mechanics is largely not so relevant for

608
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,240
most Goods we do but for some Goods who

609
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,240
delay the semester to be critical and

610
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,399
that's why it's important to understand

611
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:32,080
the mechanics and this is um basically

612
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,840
the fact that when a price changes when

613
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,440
a price changes so this calls mechanics

614
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,440
of a price

615
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,279
change when a price changes two things

616
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,399
happen simultaneously you may not

617
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,960
realize it but actually when a price

618
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,320
changes two things

619
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,200
happen the first is what we call the

620
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,200
substitution

621
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:02,159
effect the substitution effect which is

622
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,159
when relative prices change you want to

623
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,559
shift away from the good that's gotten

624
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,919
relatively expensive towards the good

625
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,159
that's gotten less

626
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,360
expensive that's the substitution effect

627
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,200
you say yeah that makes sense that's a

628
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,240
price change but the second one is the

629
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,320
income

630
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,440
effect which is when a price changes

631
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,640
you're also effectively richer or poorer

632
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,240
and that also affects your

633
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,600
demand so when a price changes two

634
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,039
things happen Goods become

635
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,799
differentially attractive and you're

636
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,520
richer or poor and both things drive

637
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,840
your response to that price change and

638
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,159
it turns out understanding the

639
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,240
difference between them will end up

640
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,279
being critical for a number of things

641
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,520
we'll do this semester and that's why

642
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,520
I'm bothering telling you so

643
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,039
okay so let to understand this we're

644
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,440
going to go through one of the more

645
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,720
complicated examples of this class so

646
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,520
that's why I'm leaving time with time

647
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,880
for it we're going to talk about

648
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,799
decomposing a price change into an

649
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,960
income and substitution effect and then

650
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,760
I get we're going to do the math of this

651
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,200
in section or did we yeah we'll do the

652
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,559
mathematics of this in section it's hard

653
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,720
enough I'll do the graphics here and the

654
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,640
intuition the math will be covered in

655
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,200
section okay so now let's go back to our

656
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,880
classic example we start at Point a

657
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,320
we're on original budget constraint one

658
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,000
so this is figure four five look at bc1

659
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,799
that's original budget constraint and

660
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,240
our indifference curve is tangent at

661
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,279
Point a so as we've said a number of

662
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,279
times this sem this lecture we choose

663
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,279
six cookies and three pizzas that's our

664
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,480
base

665
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:42,279
case now imagine that the price of

666
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,480
cookies rises from $2 to

667
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,360
$3 well we know what happens we solve

668
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,120
for that already earlier this lecture

669
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,080
when the price cookies rise from $2 $3

670
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,760
we know you move from point A to point

671
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,000
C you move from consuming six cookies

672
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,159
and three slices of pizza of four

673
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,159
cookies and three slice of pizza we

674
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,679
already solve for that great you already

675
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,600
know that why aren't we done

676
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,120
we are done because that's composed of

677
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,039
two effects a substitution effect and

678
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,720
income effect how do we measure these

679
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:10,360
well the way we do it

680
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,559
graphically is we say the substitution

681
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,840
effect is technically

682
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,159
defined as the change in the quantity

683
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,720
purchased holding utility constant so

684
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,519
it's Delta

685
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,440
Q at

686
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,440
ubar holding your utility

687
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,559
constant how would you change change

688
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,440
your mix of

689
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,919
goods how do we measure that we measure

690
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,640
by drawing an imaginary budget

691
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,720
constraint BC Prime this isn't a real

692
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,440
budget constraints imaginary and we find

693
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,200
the point and what is BC Prime BC Prime

694
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,279
has two features first of all it is

695
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,720
parallel to the new budget

696
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,880
constraint it's parallel to the new it's

697
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,519
got the new price ratios the slope of

698
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,519
the new budget constraint of BC Prime is

699
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:02,600
the same as bc2 so minus 3/4 right that

700
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:05,039
was the uh the slope was uh yeah minus

701
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,279
3/4 okay so the new budget constraint

702
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,559
has a slope of minus 3/4s but it is

703
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,480
tangent to the original indifference

704
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,519
curve the one that contains point

705
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,880
a so once again how do we measure the

706
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,200
substitution effect we measure it by

707
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,440
drawing a new budget constraint

708
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,840
imaginary budget

709
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,880
constraint that is parallel to the new

710
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,799
budget constraint it it's the new price

711
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,799
ratio minus 3/4 instead of minus a half

712
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,919
but tangent to the old indifference

713
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,600
curve and think about what that's doing

714
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,880
we're showing you the change in qu

715
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,960
quantity you get at a constant utility

716
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,480
how do we keep utility constant we stay

717
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,519
in the same indifference curve so by

718
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,480
staying in the same indifference curve

719
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,440
we're holding utility constant and we're

720
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,559
showing you that even with utility

721
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,120
constant you would want fewer cookies

722
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,880
why would you want why would you want

723
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,039
fewer cookies you'd move from six

724
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,679
cookies to 4.89 cookies why because

725
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,240
cookies have gotten more expensive Rel

726
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,799
to Pizza

727
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,039
that's the pure substance doesn't matter

728
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,200
you're rich or poor it's just cookies

729
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,440
have got more expensive you want fewer

730
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,559
of

731
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,159
them it's easy understand if we go

732
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,640
directly to the second

733
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,720
effect okay if we go directly to the

734
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,159
second effect okay which is um oh well

735
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,600
no actually let me do one thing first I

736
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,320
want to First prove to

737
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,720
you that the substitution effect is

738
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,039
always

739
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,360
negative the substitution effect is

740
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,880
always

741
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,640
negative okay so to prove that so

742
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,200
graphically we can prove that by just

743
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,320
noting that if you're on the same

744
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,960
indifference

745
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,080
curve and you're tangent to a steeper

746
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,279
budget

747
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,279
constraint you must be to the left right

748
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,679
if I'm the same IND different Square the

749
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,760
bud straight steepen I must be to the

750
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,240
left of the original point so it's got

751
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,240
to be a negative

752
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,639
effect

753
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,840
mathematically think of this in Five

754
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:03,279
Steps step one the substitution effect

755
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,440
puts you at the tangency of the

756
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,399
difference curve in

757
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:14,320
prices we know at that

758
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:18,000
tangency that mu C over muu s

759
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,480
equals PC over PS I just canceled the

760
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,039
negatives okay we know those are equal

761
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,320
at any tangency we know those are equal

762
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,840
at every

763
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,159
tangency we know that this has gone up

764
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,919
price of cookies has gone up Rel to

765
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,240
pizza slices right once again jump in if

766
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,080
anything's not

767
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,440
clear if that goes up what has to happen

768
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,880
this has to go up they have to be equal

769
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,320
the right side went up so the left side

770
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,000
has to go up how do you make the

771
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,559
marginal utility ratio go up how do you

772
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,080
make it so that the ratio marginal of

773
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,399
cookies the marginality of slices goes

774
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,559
up what do you do how can you

775
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:59,720
operationalize that

776
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,480
well how do you make the numerator

777
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,960
higher how do you make the Marge utility

778
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,720
of cookies

779
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,080
bigger

780
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,399
yeah yeah remember Marge utilities are

781
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,840
negative function of quantity I said

782
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,240
they're confusing the fewer cookies you

783
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,440
have the more each cookie is

784
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,600
worth if you have fewer cookies that

785
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,760
means you have to have more slices if

786
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,240
you have more slices what does that do

787
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:26,039
to the marginality of slices it lowers

788
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,039
it so by shifting from cookies to slices

789
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,320
you lower the r you rate I'm sorry you

790
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:31,559
raise the ratio margin utilities you

791
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,519
raise the numerator and lower the

792
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:37,480
denominator through that

793
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,639
shift so you therefore say that if

794
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,679
you're going to be tangent and you're

795
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:46,840
going have a higher price ratio you

796
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,880
must have fewer cookies and more slices

797
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,799
by definition and that's the proof that

798
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,799
substitution effects are

799
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,440
negative okay questions about that

800
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,760
if the price goes up

801
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,519
Absolutely I'll tell you that in a

802
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,519
minute but this if the price goes

803
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,519
up

804
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,799
okay other questions it's a good

805
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,320
question good clarification okay now

806
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,080
let's go to the second effect the income

807
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,840
effect the income effect is say is

808
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,200
measuring the change the effect of the

809
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,039
the Delta

810
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,440
quantity due to income effectively

811
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,639
Rising

812
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
what do you mean income Rises your

813
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:36,000
income hasn't changed

814
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,279
here why is income effectively risen why

815
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,840
are you effectively Rich I'm sorry um

816
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,240
sorry the income is Fallen my bad your

817
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,159
income's effectively fallen in this case

818
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,360
why are you effectively

819
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,720
poor now your income hasn't changed why

820
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,279
effectively poor

821
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,559
yeah yeah your opportunity set has been

822
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,600
constricted so your income itself hasn't

823
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,320
fallen but your resources have what you

824
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,880
can buy with that income has fallen

825
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,120
you're effectively

826
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,000
poor so it's not really that why is

827
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,320
Fallen it's sort of why over sort of the

828
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,280
composite price you know the the price

829
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,800
level has fallen why over the price

830
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,359
levels Fallen the overall price level in

831
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,399
society's increased pizza's the same

832
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,200
cookies are up so your effective income

833
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,839
is Fallen your real income is

834
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,240
Fallen okay you're effectively poor what

835
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,240
does that mean if you're effectively

836
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,200
poor what's going to happen

837
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,480
well what does that depend on that

838
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,000
depends

839
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,720
on

840
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,480
this that's why I bother telling you so

841
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,079
I'm a big Dr Seuss fan okay basically if

842
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,200
it's a normal

843
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,399
good and the and your income goes down

844
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,079
what will you do you'll have less of it

845
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,320
but if it's an inferior good and income

846
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:56,280
goes down what will you do you'll have

847
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,119
more of it so while the substitution

848
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,320
effect can be signed the income effect

849
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,599
cannot the in effect cannot be signed

850
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,320
because it depends on whether it's a

851
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,960
normal or inferior

852
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,520
good

853
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:13,079
okay in the case we're showing here in

854
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,520
figure four five this is a normal good

855
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,599
so the income effect works in tandem

856
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,599
with the substitution effect the

857
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,320
substitution effect you want so you want

858
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,480
fewer cookies for two reasons let's

859
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,680
here's the intuition here's the key

860
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,400
intuition you want fewer cookies for two

861
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,440
reasons first cookies are a worse deal

862
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,599
you have the opportunity cost of cookies

863
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,200
has

864
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,480
risen second you're effectively poorer

865
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,599
your opportunity set is constricted and

866
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,359
cookies are normal good so for those two

867
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,400
reasons you want fewer

868
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:46,680
cookies but what if cookies were an

869
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,680
inferior good then the graph would look

870
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,359
like figure

871
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,960
46 the graph like figure 46 in this case

872
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,440
the substitution effect would go one way

873
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,079
but the income effect would go the other

874
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,960
way and the net would be

875
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,319
unclear now we've drawn figure 46 such

876
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,960
that the demand for cookie still Falls

877
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:09,920
but you don't have to draw it that

878
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,680
way okay so the key thing is the

879
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,240
substitution effect has to be the

880
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,480
opposite of the sign of the price change

881
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,560
negative but let's be clear it's good

882
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,079
clarification Subs effect has to be the

883
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,319
opposite of the sign of the price change

884
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,440
the income effect does not think effect

885
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:24,560
depends on whether it's a normal or

886
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,839
inferior

887
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:32,880
good this is pretty confusing so I find

888
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,640
it's useful to um to actually uh think

889
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,119
about well let's let's actually rush

890
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,359
through figure 4 six let's what figure

891
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,480
46 is because it's not this I I I rush

892
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:42,800
you figure 46 let's go back figure 46 is

893
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,160
no longer pizza and cookies figure 46 is

894
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,040
now steak and potatoes okay because

895
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,640
pizza and cookies are both normal Goods

896
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,160
potatoes is the classic inferior

897
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,720
good right poor people especially back

898
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,599
in the day used to have to eat potatoes

899
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,200
because they were cheap to grow and very

900
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,480
filling and steak was

901
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,400
unaffordable but basically as you get

902
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,839
richer you want fewer potatoes and more

903
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,319
steak okay especially an Agricultural

904
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,480
Society okay so let's say originally

905
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:12,640
people are at

906
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,960
bc1 where the price of steak is $5 the

907
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,280
price of potatoes a

908
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,440
dollar the price of steak is $5 the

909
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,680
price of potato is a dollar and let's

910
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,680
say their income is $25 so in this

911
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,960
example incomes

912
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,560
25 the price of a stake

913
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,760
is five and the price of

914
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,359
potatoes is

915
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,520
one okay so the budget constraint looks

916
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,760
like

917
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,440
bc1 you can have for $25 you can have 25

918
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,560
potatoes or five

919
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,839
steaks and let's say your preferences

920
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,280
are such that you end up at Point a you

921
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,599
choose to have three and a half steaks

922
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,000
and seven and a half potatoes okay once

923
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,040
again I just got that through the magic

924
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,280
we showed you last time this is

925
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
constrained optimization I'm not writing

926
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,000
down the utility function I'm just going

927
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,000
right to the results but you know how to

928
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,240
get there

929
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,200
now let's say that things change and the

930
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,640
price of potatoes rise to $3 a

931
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,880
pound steak is still five bucks a pound

932
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,520
potatoes are now $3 a pound now what

933
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,839
happens is your budget strange shifts

934
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,839
into

935
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,280
bc2 your budget constraint is pivoted in

936
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,880
massively so now you still have five

937
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,240
Stakes of all you want is stake but you

938
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:28,760
can only have 8.3 potatoes on your $25

939
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,960
of income new budget screen is bc2

940
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,720
what happens well let's look at the

941
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,319
income and substitution effects the

942
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,800
substitution effect we get by drawing an

943
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:38,240
imaginary budget constraint BC Prime

944
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,440
what are the features of BC prime it is

945
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,200
parallel to the new budget

946
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:46,920
constraint but tangent to the old

947
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,880
indifference curve and so that puts us

948
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,400
at point B so substitution effect lowers

949
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,680
our demand for for

950
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,760
potatoes from 7 and2 to four we knew had

951
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,280
to lower it subst effect is

952
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,520
unambiguously signed the price went up

953
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,520
so you got to have few of them that's

954
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,119
unambiguous the income effect however

955
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,720
goes the other way because potatoes are

956
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,079
inferior in other words now that you're

957
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,040
so poor now potatoes so expensive you

958
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,280
don't have money for steak anymore so

959
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,800
you gotta have more potatoes it's ironic

960
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,680
right but basically potatoes getting

961
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,839
expensive has made you poor when you're

962
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,200
poor you got to have more

963
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,040
potatoes okay and so the income effect

964
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,440
goes the other way because potatoes are

965
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,599
an inferior good effect takes you back

966
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,680
from wanting four potatoes up to wanting

967
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,319
five potatoes so the net effect if we

968
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,800
didn't income substitution would we just

969
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:41,000
see well with your demand curve would

970
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,920
just say oh well you know demand curve

971
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,960
slop down it's you know we get a higher

972
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,400
price leads to fewer potatoes but we

973
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,160
miss the fact that the substitution

974
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,560
effects are going opposite

975
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,560
directions okay questions about that

976
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,560
example

977
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,599
yeah they're all price going there's the

978
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,599
price of potatoes going up to three from

979
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,280
I'm sorry the price of potatoes went

980
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,359
from one to

981
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,760
three okay Price p went from one to

982
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:11,960
three that led to a substition effect

983
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,440
that we know which way it goes when a

984
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,880
price goes up you want less of something

985
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,680
the substitution effect but an income

986
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,680
effect that went the other way now that

987
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,160
leads the natural question can you

988
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,480
actually get an income effect for an

989
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,640
inferior good that ends up bigger than

990
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
the substitution effect that is Could

991
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,960
you actually get get demand curves to

992
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,880
not slope down think about what would

993
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,359
happen if the income effect was so big

994
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,119
that it pushed you past the original

995
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,200
point it pushed you to the right past

996
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,319
the original intersection well that

997
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,960
would imply something funky that would

998
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,839
imply demand curve slope down demand

999
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,119
curve slope up instead of sloping down

1000
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:48,240
then apply demand curve slope up that

1001
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:50,599
would say higher prices make you want

1002
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,000
more of something which violates what we

1003
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,240
the very first lecture of this class we

1004
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,319
said domain curves slop

1005
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,920
down but it's possible theoretically

1006
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,920
that you can get what's called a gfin

1007
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:09,280
good a gfin good is a good where the

1008
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,240
income effect the good is so

1009
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,640
inferior that the income effect

1010
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,160
dominates the substitution effect you

1011
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,440
end up with a wrong signed relationship

1012
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,079
between price and demand you actually

1013
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,480
get that a higher price leads to more

1014
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:26,280
demand or an upward sloping demand

1015
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,839
curve now can that happen well I like to

1016
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,599
I like the name GF and because it rhymes

1017
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,960
with Griffin and Griffins are

1018
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,000
imaginary okay GI and goods are also

1019
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,200
largely imaginary it's a great

1020
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,760
theoretical concept but they don't

1021
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,319
really exist

1022
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,520
yeah a VIN Goods is a different Vin

1023
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:42,760
that's a totally different concept

1024
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,280
that's that's the concept that basically

1025
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,480
you want more when the price is up

1026
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,400
because you care about your social

1027
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,599
standing uh but that's that's sort of a

1028
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,720
behavioral economics thing we'll come

1029
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,400
back to that talk behav it's not a

1030
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,040
standard economics

1031
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,880
effect so GI and goods really don't

1032
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:59,800
exist um the classic example people

1033
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,200
often have had was well gee when the

1034
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,720
price of

1035
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,680
potatoes um went up uh in Ireland cuz

1036
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,000
the potato blight people ended up

1037
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,560
consuming more potatoes so potato

1038
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,359
consumption went up per person in

1039
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,079
Ireland when the price of potatoes went

1040
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,520
up during the potato blight people said

1041
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,640
aha potatoes are a GI and good but

1042
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,000
here's what they got wrong here's where

1043
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,160
empirical economics is fun they missed

1044
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,520
the fact that what other effect did the

1045
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,880
potato blight have it chased all the

1046
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,960
people who could afford it out of

1047
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,400
Ireland the only people who left were

1048
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,640
super poor so yeah so yeah on average

1049
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,960
potatoes per person went up but it

1050
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
wasn't that each person consume more

1051
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,040
it's just people who didn't consume many

1052
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,359
potatoes left all people left were just

1053
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,079
huge potato consumers so if you look at

1054
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,920
the data you see potatoes per capita

1055
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,680
went up it's a given good what you're

1056
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,040
missing is the Capas are

1057
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,440
different each person eat more potatoes

1058
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,760
it's just the non-p poat eaters left

1059
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,640
people left with The Potato Eaters and

1060
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,800
that's why empirical economics is fun

1061
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,160
because it can help explain these kind

1062
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,920
of anomalies so where does this leave us

1063
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,640
let's draw let's draw a chart here to

1064
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,400
explain this all okay so this let's

1065
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,000
imagine we're going to have here the

1066
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,680
price

1067
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
change the price change we're going to

1068
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,839
have the substitution

1069
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,480
effect the income

1070
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,920
effect and the net

1071
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,800
effect okay and we're going to start

1072
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,359
with normal

1073
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,720
Goods we're start with normal Goods so

1074
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:28,280
with normal Goods if the price goes up

1075
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,920
like I just showed you

1076
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,280
the subs effect must be negative must be

1077
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,280
the opposite of the price

1078
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,960
change the income

1079
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,359
effect if it's a normal good must also

1080
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,800
be

1081
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:48,040
negative therefore on net you get a

1082
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,480
higher price leads to lower

1083
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,640
demand likewise if the price goes down

1084
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,720
this is what this good this good

1085
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,319
question was highlighting I was just

1086
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,400
looking a price going up well in that

1087
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,240
case the substitution effect let's think

1088
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,520
about the

1089
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,800
intuition if the price of cookies went

1090
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,160
down we have just lowered the

1091
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,040
opportunity cost of having

1092
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,920
cookies therefore we're going to want

1093
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,240
more cookies and fewer Pizza through the

1094
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,760
substitution effect so therefore the

1095
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,960
substitution effect will be positive if

1096
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,640
the price goes down the income effect

1097
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,280
will also be positive why why the income

1098
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,520
effect be positive if the price of

1099
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,839
cookies goes

1100
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,680
down why the income effect be positive

1101
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:30,079
yeah

1102
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,400
you're effectively richer you can buy

1103
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,839
more cookies with the same money since

1104
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,520
you're richer you want more normal Goods

1105
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,559
cookies are normal good you want more

1106
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,040
cookies so this goes

1107
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,400
up now what's more interesting is what

1108
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,960
if these goods were inferior what if

1109
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,880
cookies were

1110
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,359
inferior so now when the price goes

1111
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,400
up what happens to substitution effect

1112
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,079
through Subs effect is demand it goes

1113
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,000
down as this gentleman helpfully pointed

1114
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,240
it goes down why because we know the

1115
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,960
sign of substitution effects they're

1116
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,400
always the opposite of the price change

1117
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,200
no mystery there price goes up

1118
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,040
substitution effects are Subs effect

1119
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,559
drives demand down price goes down

1120
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,040
substitution effect um I'm sorry goes up

1121
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,559
yeah right PR price goes up Subs effect

1122
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,280
drives demand down price goes down

1123
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,040
substitute effect drives demand up those

1124
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,880
never change so here if the price goes

1125
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,960
down substitute effect will be positive

1126
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,599
those don't change what changes is the

1127
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,200
income effect if it's an inferior good

1128
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:32,240
if it's an inferior

1129
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:35,040
good now when the price goes up okay

1130
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,000
when the price goes up you want more of

1131
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,559
it and when the price goes down you want

1132
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,559
less of it so the net is

1133
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:51,760
unclear okay so once again if goods are

1134
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,119
normal then demand curves look like them

1135
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,000
you know then basically there's no this

1136
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,359
this seems if goods are normal it seems

1137
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,559
like I just wasted 20 minutes to your

1138
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,760
time right because if goods are normal

1139
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,720
it's like well look yeah they build on

1140
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,400
each other but we end up in the same

1141
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,480
place in the imaginary B strs imaginary

1142
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,839
anyway so who cares the answer is I'll

1143
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,440
tell you why we care in three or four Le

1144
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,920
in about six

1145
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,880
lectures because it turns out when you

1146
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,359
make your decisions about how hard

1147
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,359
you're going to work or how much you're

1148
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,599
going to save income sub effects are

1149
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,559
going to start to work against each

1150
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,559
other this case is only really

1151
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,680
interesting if the income affects if

1152
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,000
it's an inferior good and then you can

1153
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,200
get some interesting things although

1154
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,880
practice we don't really have gi and

1155
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,800
goods but in theory at least you can get

1156
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,240
interesting

1157
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,800
things okay questions about

1158
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,720
that okay one other announcement please

1159
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,200
