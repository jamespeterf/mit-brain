00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
Now, we don't often experience

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,799
exponential growth in our everyday

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,960
lives. To gain an intuition for how

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
powerful it can be, you may remember the

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,480
old riddle where your employer asks you,

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,800
"How would you like to be paid this

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,880
month?" And you have two choices. Either

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,640
I'll start you with one penny and then

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,400
each day for one month I'll double the

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
number of pennies and you can keep the

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
pennies from the last day. [music] Or

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,760
you can have a million dollars. Now,

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840
it's quite normal to think through the

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,000
first few days of pennies. for example,

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
two pennies on day one, four pennies on

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,239
day two, double that to eight pennies on

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
day three, and you begin to think that a

18
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,600
million dollars is starting to look

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
pretty good. But in fact, if you take

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
that million dollars, you've lost a lot

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,120
of money because the number of pennies

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,600
is growing exponentially as 2 to the nth

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,520
power, where n is the number of days. So

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
on the 31st day, the last day of the

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,800
month, you have 2 to the 31 pennies, and

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,360
that's equivalent to about $21 million.

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,280
That's the power of exponential growth.
