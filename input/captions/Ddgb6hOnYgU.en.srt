00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,200
Hi everyone, my name is Ruiz, the

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,200
founder and CEO of Ocadian. We

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
revolutionize workplace safety health

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
with predictive voice AI, saving

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,600
hundreds of thousands of lives and

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,520
millions of

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,480
dollars. In the movie Adestra, the

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,439
captain undergo regular voice assessment

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,960
to evaluate fatigue and readiness before

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,480
every high-risk space operations.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,120
Imagine applying this technology into

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,760
real world workplaces where fatigue and

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,360
impairments causes injuries, accidents

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,280
and billions in losses every

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,760
year. This is no longer just a sci-fi.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,239
We're building this future with a

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,640
world-class team with expertise in

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,280
speech technology, machine learning and

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
occupational health. We're bringing top

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
expertise from MIT and Harvard

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,079
commercialization experience of

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,680
translational voice bark research and

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,559
deep industry experience in safety and

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
compliance of the heavy industry. We're

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,400
the first one to apply this clinical

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,760
grade technology into the industrial

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,439
setting. Workforce fatigue is highly

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,479
prevent but still under addressed. Every

29
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,799
year in industry like transportation,

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,720
mining, construction and aviation,

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,520
fatigue contributes to more than 140

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,479
billion economic losses and over 100,000

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,400
accidents every

34
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,560
year. Today, many industries still rely

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,520
on

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,720
self-reporting. Sensor based solutions

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,439
and machine based testing and safety

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,360
cameras in the driving scenarios provide

39
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,439
real-time detections of behavior cues.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,280
But it's not

41
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,119
enough. Effective solution must focus on

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,119
some prevention beyond real-time

43
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,600
detection. And current solutions also

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,360
are intrusive and

45
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,680
effective. We're driving this paradigm

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
shift with

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,759
predictive predictive fatigue risk

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,560
management. We build this future with

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,200
voice biomarker and circadian science.

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
And here comes Volcadian.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,000
We're building this voice AI powered B2B

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,200
SAS platform for predictive fatiguity

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,959
management. Workers conduct short speech

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,680
assessments just in just 30 seconds

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
before their regular

56
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,480
shifts. Our AI will assess fatigue,

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,760
predict the risk and inform managers to

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,080
optimize schedules and test dispatch and

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,000
take personalized

60
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,239
interventions. all happened without any

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,840
intrusive

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,040
monitoring or extra

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,200
hardware. This is just not just a

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,959
theory. Since launching, we've been

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,560
working with industryleading customers

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,840
in transportation, trucking and heavy

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,319
industries. We have we have done

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,720
commercial pilots in both Latin America

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,800
and

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,599
US and also secure insurance partnership

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,640
in work compensation and liability. Our

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,120
early pilots show promising outcomes

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,360
with 90% model performance in

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,159
sensitivity and specificity compared to

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,920
the industry standard PVT test. In

76
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,400
average, we our pilot shows 26% risk

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,280
fatigue related risk incidence reduction

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
and a 92% productivity uplift by

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,239
streamlined mobile solutions. This saves

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,040
every worker in average six hours per

81
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,280
week. Our solution is unique,

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,200
preventative, hardware free, timesaving,

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,720
and we designed a product that align the

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,239
incentives between employees and

85
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,319
employers. We mitigate risk before the

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
risk

87
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,120
occurs. We're targeting the market in

88
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,280
LAM and US with plan for global

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,200
expansion. And we see this is a growing

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,680
trend with increasing market demand for

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,000
proactive safety

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,760
solutions. Our goto market is twofold.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,480
We sell directly to safety high safety

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,959

a tiered per user per monthbased

96
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,959
software subscription. We also works

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,199
with channel partners licensing to

98
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,400

99
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
comp portfolio companies who adopt

100
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,479
vocadian and we work with safety

101
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,960
technology providers and vendors through

102
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,440
API integration and technology

103
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,759
integration. Fatigue is just starting

104
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,080
point with the expanding capability of

105
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,360
voice barker. Our goal is to address a

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,000
comprehensive occupational impairment

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,400

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,240
with also with dise occupational

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,080
disease. Today we're are looking for
