1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
Caitlyn Becker reminds us that to design

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,440
a product is to design the processes by

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,880
which it is made. And approaching

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,320
problems at the interface of design and

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,440
manufacturing offers opportunities for

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
disruptive change. Navigating design,

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,880
manufacturing, and material spaces in

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,160
parallel becomes increasingly relevant

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,519
as we address modern challenges with

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,320
materials or environments that bring

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,400
both unique and beneficial attributes.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,160
while at the same time imposing

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
stringent restrictions on design and

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,079
manufacturing. Today, Professor Becker

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,879
will discuss how taking an integrated

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,920
approach to design and manufacturing has

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,039
improved the reliability and extended

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,559
the reach of soft robots, enabling deep

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,980
sea exploration and biological sampling.

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,180
Please welcome Professor Caitlyn Becker.

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,180
[Applause]

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:10,050
[Music]

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
Thank you very much. I'm very excited to

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,439
be here. Uh let's see. Uh I'm going to

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,680
talk about how I use some uh materials

26
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,200
in non-traditional ways. And um I do

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
that kind of at the intersection of

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
machine design and manufacturing. I use

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,000
soft materials to make robots. I use

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,360
glass to make

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,520
structures. Now, um just a little bit of

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
context on me uh to give you some

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
background. So, I actually started at

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,200
MIT for undergrad uh in mechanical

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
engineering where I'm back now over a

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,240
little bit over a decade later, but then

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
I worked in manufacturing for a little

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,720
while and then went back to school at

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Harvard to work on unusual robots and

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,159
now I'm back in the mechanical

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,720
engineering department. I worked in

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,439
medical devices, subcutaneous defibrills

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,640
and surgical staplers. Um, and then I

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,200
worked in nanop fabrication. So I had a

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,439
very hands-on approach to manufacturing

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,879
where essentially I figured out how to

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,239
replicate this structure, this fatonic

48
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,200
structure, first from a silicon wafer

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,720
and then by hand into

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,840
polymers and then turn that into a

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
machine that could do this in a

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,319
roll-to-roll format. So all by hand I

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,080
made everything that you see there and

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,239
basically figured out how I could

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,959
replicate features on the scale of a

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,360
50th of the diameter of your hair in a

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,120
roll-to-roll continuous format. And so

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
now what I try to do is then teach my

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
students how to be able to do this

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,440
fluently. how to go from kind of these

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,200
basic robots into something that's a

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,400
little bit more functional and then go

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,800
from kind of bespoke projects into

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,959
something where they can make largecale

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,080
kind of decisions and design. And so

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
what I'll talk about yesterday is a

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,959
little bit or sorry tomorrow is a little

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
bit of what we do with that with making

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,800
yo-yos and taking students into uh

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,040
industry. But then I'll also talk about

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,360
now kind of one some of my inspiration

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,599
of finding the intersection between

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,159
design and manufacturing and that was at

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
MIT in the glass lab where I now have

75
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,080
been actually a technical instructor for

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
15 years. So I teach manufacturing by

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
day for my day job and then at night I

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
go over to the glass lab and I teach

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,599
manufacturing for fun and for art. But

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
the reason I think this is relevant is

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,239
glass is if nothing an art form of

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,519
process design. And this is a piece that

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,200
I made about uh 10 years

84
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,800
ago. And actually the gentleman who's in

85
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,319
the background there is my collaborator

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,319
for the additive glass manufacturing

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,760
that I'll talk about in a little bit.

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,159
But essentially we have a lab in uh MIT

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,400
where basically the equations that we

90
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,480
teach in mechanics of materials and heat

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
transfer in manufacturing actually come

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,959
to life in the material and you can

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,280
actually experience those. And I would

94
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,040
say this has given me the inspiration to

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,599
have two minds about how I approach my

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
research. One is an artist or maybe more

97
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,439
accurately a craftsman that tries to

98
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,439
make things that um are really hard to

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,360
make look beautiful and simple. So these

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
are actually kind of a take on a

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,640
traditional Venetian technique of cane

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,360
work. Um that I

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,280
then if we can advance

104
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,280
um and the color work actually is kind

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
of what looks like the complicated part

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
but it's really the form here. So the

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
artist in me wants to say I want to make

108
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
something that's very difficult to make

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
look very simple and beautiful. And the

110
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
engineer wants to take something that

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
looks incredibly complicated to make

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,560
like the color application here and make

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,720
it actually relatively simple. And I do

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,440
that with simple tools as well. So I

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,000
start from just clear nuggets of glass

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,040
and white bars. And I use essentially

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,440
metal sticks to turn those into white

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
stripes. I turn those into cane, a form

119
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
of essentially you could think of it as

120
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,840
like pieces of lace. The lace then gets

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
fused together and morphed around a

122
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,560
sphere.

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,759
Now, the most direct transition to my

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,240
research would be if I then took you

125
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
into the additive manufacturing of

126
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,759
glass, but we're going to go to soft

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,759
robots

128
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,680
instead. meters underwater picking up a

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
sea cucumber. Now, the marine biologists

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
I work with don't actually care too much

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
about sea cucumbers, but this was a

132
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,639
demonstration that while withstanding

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,199
many uh like thousands of pounds, sorry,

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
of the units of hydrostatic pressure, I

135
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
could also gently pick up an animal

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
without stressing it out. Important to

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,639
the marine biologists that I collaborate

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
with because these animals when they get

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,880
stressed change their DNA expression,

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
which meaningfully affects the science.

141
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
And so then when what we're really

142
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,759
looking for is endangered coral, I can

143
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,160
show them this picture and say, "Look, I

144
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,240
picked up the sea cucumber. It was safe.

145
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
It did not express stress in the sense

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
that when these creatures are stressed,

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
they'll actually, it's not the most

148
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
pleasant thing right before lunch, but

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
they'll avert their stomach as a way of

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
saying like, "Hey, here's my wallet.

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Please don't mess me up." Um, we're able

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,600
to pick it up, give it a hug, put it

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,759
back down. But the way that I actually

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
make these robots differs a little bit

155
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,240
from the traditional machine design that

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,919
I learned in undergrad. And so I have to

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
think about kind of how do I then use

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,919
soft materials to make something that's

159
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,440
traditionally rigid. What functionality

160
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,240
can I get out of using a different

161
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,080
material? And so we take a lot of

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
inspiration for things like from things

163
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
like octtopi and actually to be honest

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,759
cartoons. I think Disney has done a

165
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,280
great job in imagining what we could do

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,440
if our robots were a little bit more

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,479
compliant and friendly. And so then how

168
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,840
do I build that into reliable machines?

169
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
Well, I'll tell you I don't do it the

170
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,160
way I do with rigid materials. If you

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,600
try to bolt squishy things together, if

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
you try to glue them or braze them

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,560
together, they will delaminate. It will

174
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,360
not end

175
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:51,360
well. So then when trying to make soft

176
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,240
hands reliable enough for deep sea

177
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,600
biological sampling, it was my first

178
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,520
application. Um I have to think about

179
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,280
how to make them last longer, how to

180
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
give them higher payloads, higher burst

181
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
pressure. And so I'll go out to sea on a

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,759
vessel like this for maybe about a week,

183
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,000
a little bit longer. Um, I don't go in

184
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
the water. You couldn't pay me enough to

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,759
go any more than 10 meters underwater.

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,840
So, we send an ROV like this, Hercules,

187
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
down thousands of meters underwater. And

188
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
by the way, this is actually the boat

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,360
that discovered the Titanic. And I think

190
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
this pointer won't work on here, but um,

191
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
Argus, the ROV on the left is actually

192
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,960
the ROV that discovered and videotaped

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,039
the Titanic in that initial discovery.

194
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
But what I what I see when I'm on the

195
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,080
ship, everything comes out of this

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,759
bubble cam and I have a rigid

197
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
manipulator that I'm frankly not

198
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
controlling. It's the pilots who do a

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,400
wonderful job. But if you see what this

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,479
looks like, as talented as the pilots

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,800
are, let's go back and see if we can

202
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,800
start

203
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,400
this. Um, it's a difficult task. You

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
have a rigid manipulator that was

205
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,080
designed for construction and demolition

206
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,960
laying oil pipeline trying to pick up a

207
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,319
squishy little mobile creature. And then

208
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,400
sometimes when you pick it up, it's no

209
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,360
longer

210
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,639
mobile. Oops. Um, even more so, um,

211
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
sometimes when you pick things up, they

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
start to break. And so if you could make

213
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
a compliant gripper, not only are you

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
reducing the stress, you're actually

215
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,919
increasing the success rate of

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,440
retrieving some of these samples by

217
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,960
making something a little bit more

218
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,759
compliant. So I pioneered this. I think

219
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,360
this was work from 2015, 2016. On the

220
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
left here, we went down 300 meters

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
underwater in the Red Sea. And then a

222
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
more recent example of one of my

223
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
prototypes uh went down to 4,000 meters

224
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,759
underwater and was on display in the

225
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,279
American Museum of Natural History. And

226
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,360
to see what this looks like a little bit

227
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,880
in situ. This is still kind of older

228
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,039
videography of the um grasps, but here

229
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,159
we are picking up the sea cucumber or

230
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,480
giving a holoran a hug. Um, but

231
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,720
essentially one of the things that's

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
really helpful is that by working with

233
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
materials that are more compliant,

234
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,760
closer to the compliance of the

235
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,279
creatures that we're picking up, I can

236
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,959
actually passively adapt to them. Now,

237
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,360
this is one of the squishiest things

238
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,120
that I pick up. But if it's a crab or

239
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
coral, then the fingers can actually

240
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,959
adapt to the creature that we're picking

241
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,120
up. And then another challenge with

242
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,760
rigid materials is seawater is actually

243
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
incredibly corrosive, but the silicones

244
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,560
that I use are so inert that I can

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,080
actually use salt water as my hydraulic

246
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,680
fluid. So if I spring a leak, I'm not

247
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,120
contaminating the coral colonies that

248
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,320
we're studying. It's really

249
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,640
important. Okay, what I won't talk about

250
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
so much today is some of the design that

251
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,160
I do around this. Basically adding

252
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
structural adaptation essentially not

253
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
using artificial intelligence, but using

254
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
physical intelligence. I program

255
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,240
behavior into these underlying materials

256
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,800
to make them behave in certain ways and

257
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,480
have certain limited contact pressure. I

258
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
can tune the contact. Imagine if you

259
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
could turn the friction of your

260
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
fingertips on and off while manipulating

261
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
something to give you more dexterity. I

262
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
will tell you a little bit about the

263
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
distributed contact. We'll come back to

264
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,320
that. But I'll also skip some of the

265
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
sensing and control that we do in the

266
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,959
lab to talk more about the manufacturing

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,240
because really that's the most important

268
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,360
piece when doing this work at sea. It

269
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,800
costs $60,000 a day or more to operate

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,800
one of those vessels and a dive of the

271
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,760
like so sending the ROV remote operating

272
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,839
vehicle down might last for over a day.

273
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,800
So if one of my hydraulic actuators, one

274
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,600
of my squishy balloons pops a leak,

275
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,959
that's a lot of opportunity lost. Um,

276
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,959
not to mention kind of how that looks

277
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,800
when we're in live broadcast and then

278
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,279
with the uh marine biologist sitting

279
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,640
right next to me. Now, the trick to

280
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,040
getting these to be more

281
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,160
robust was actually figuring out how to

282
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,240
monolithically mold complex geometries.

283
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,800
So, imagine that pink thing there is a

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,360
gummy bear and that's getting a blue

285
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,800
casing around it. You let it cure and

286
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,560
then you pull the gummy bear out.

287
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,000
Basically, I can make very complex

288
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,519
actuators without any seams because

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,560
seams is where things seams are things

290
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,720
where where things usually burst. Now,

291
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,079
if you really geek out about the

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
manufacturing though, you can get into

293
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,240
the fact that we're using additive

294
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,200
manufacturing to make the

295
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,160
molds. And if you think about some of

296
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
the vestigial effects and the

297
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,200
nitty-gritty details of the additive

298
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,920
manufacturing and which technology we

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,079
use, you can then get another doubling

300
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
of operating

301
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,800
pressure. So, by nerding out about the

302
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,560
manufacturing, I've quadrupled the

303
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,320
operating pressure and increase the

304
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,720
cycles of failure by over an order of

305
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,480
magnitude. We then take more of the air

306
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,560
out by transferring some of that from a

307
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
handcasting process to a laboratory

308
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
scale injection molding process which

309
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
then makes it something that we can

310
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,519
scale more easily if we then want to use

311
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,720
that for a larger

312
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,200
production. Now when I learned to design

313
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,600
things as an undergraduate I mostly was

314
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,839
told you know use small deformations and

315
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,040
rigid materials right no problem. Well,

316
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,880
for the most part when I'm designing

317
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,360
things, the most successful things have

318
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
large deformations and a lot of the

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,640
software that we use kind of caters

320
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,959
towards that. So, we're now bringing

321
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,360
together different pieces of software to

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
bring in functional

323
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,519
requirements and then manufacturing

324
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,279
limitations and then explore the design

325
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,680
space that's possible to get large

326
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,360
deformations, but then with that be a

327
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
little bit more nuanced about what the

328
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
functional requirements are. So a lot of

329
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
soft roboticists, I don't expect a lot

330
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
of you necessarily to be familiar with

331
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,480
this, but they might say, "Oh yes, I've

332
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,279
optimized the performance of my soft

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,000
robot. I have made it curl at the lowest

334
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,720
pressure possible." I go,

335
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,959
"Congratulations. You have now made a

336
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
weak gripper." So if it curls at a low

337
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,720
pressure, I can also unccurl it at a low

338
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,120
pressure. So I care much more about kind

339
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,760
of what is the contact force, what is

340
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,160
the gripping force, the bandwidth, some

341
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,639
nuances about also kind of at what

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,279
curvature does it actually accomplish a

343
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
certain

344
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,000
pressure. But this is all assuming that

345
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,639
I have a really good idea of what it is

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,720
that I'm trying to pick up. And that's

347
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,160
not always

348
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,560
true. So in this case, I have a glassy

349
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,839
sea sponge. You can guess what's

350
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,440
probably going to happen.

351
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,079
And you might be surprised. I was

352
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,360
surprised that it actually bends like

353
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,560
rubber. So I often don't know what my

354
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,399
specimen are going to do when I pick

355
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
them

356
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,079
up. But even if I did know, I wasn't

357
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
going to be able to do anything with

358
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:14,800
this. So I thought, what if we actually

359
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
change how we think about robotic

360
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,320
grasping? Instead of trying to make

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,399
things more precise, what if we actually

362
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
embrace

363
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,040
stochasticity? What if we add to

364
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,560
material compliance some structural

365
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,079
compliance? So we essentially have a

366
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,519
physical intelligence that passively

367
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,519
adapts to whatever it is that we're

368
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,200
picking

369
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,279
up. I'm basically showing you the same

370
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,040
thing here. So I have six different

371
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,480
trials of the same thing overlaid. So

372
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
you can see it is actually random.

373
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,320
They're a little bit different every

374
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,160
time, but the effect is the

375
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,000
same. Okay. And so the idea here is that

376
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,040
essentially the object that I'm picking

377
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,360
up actually shapes my gripper. And I do

378
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,600
this. These are actually pneumatically

379
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,279
or hydraulically actuated filaments. I

380
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
call them essentially tubes that are a

381
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,880
little bit thicker on one side. So they

382
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
curl up when you inflate them. And an

383
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
important piece of this is I don't make

384
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,360
very precise molds. I actually have open

385
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,920
face molds. I just use dipping. Um so

386
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,240
it's a lot like candle dipping

387
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,399
essentially. Here's my candle dipping

388
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,519
fixture if you will. I use surface

389
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,240
tension to then tightly control the

390
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,120
dimensions of my actuators without

391
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,199
having an expensive

392
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,519
mold. Now, if I have everything with a

393
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,199
constant film thickness like this, then

394
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,880
I have a very uninteresting robot that

395
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,639
requires some mechanical programming.

396
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,160
So, I won't go into details, but I also

397
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,079
use things like gravity, fiber

398
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,920
inclusions, electric fields, and surface

399
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,600
tension to mechanically program, if you

400
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,839
will, these actuators. So, they do

401
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,959
something interesting when I add

402
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,680
pressure. Just to give you two quick

403
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,600
examples, the array on the top is

404
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,000
mechanically programmed with gravity and

405
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,560
the bottom has a arbitrary vector field

406
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,639
programmed in with fiber

407
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,079
inclusions. So I use this for marine b

408
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,639
to work with marine biologists who study

409
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
siliary motion. Um, but a little bit

410
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
more interesting is once you make those

411
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,199
longer, you can actually use them as

412
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,800
very adaptive grippers. And again, what

413
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
I'm showing you here is that those

414
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,480
grippers then adapt to whatever it is

415
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,279
that they're picking up.

416
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,880
Um, this is hard to characterize with

417
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,760
squishy materials as you can imagine. If

418
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,600
I try to pinch that with some calipers,

419
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,000
it'll just deform. So, we actually take

420
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,639
CT scans. And I'll skip through this

421
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,240
mostly quickly for time. Um, but

422
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
basically, we can then turn that into a

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,160
digital model that we can then do more

424
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,079
mathematical analysis on to really look

425
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
at the degree of entanglement. If

426
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
anybody wants to geek out about this,

427
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
please ask me in a break. Um, but

428
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,639
essentially we can quantify how

429
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,199
entangled these actually are. And then

430
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,199
what it ends up looking like is um we

431
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,760
can even show you kind of which type of

432
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,519
object they'll best pick up. And then

433
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,560
going forward kind of what we show is

434
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,399
that essentially the it doesn't just

435
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,920
matter kind of which filaments are in

436
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
contact with an object because not every

437
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,720
filament in this gripper is going to be

438
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,040
in contact but actually the overall

439
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,040
grasp the whole is greater than the sum

440
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
of its parts. So every individual

441
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,320
contact is actually very weak and

442
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,759
gentle. But when you factor all those

443
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,120
together and then the friction between

444
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,720
each of the filaments touching other

445
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,079
filaments, it becomes actually fairly

446
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,160
robust grasp while still being

447
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,800
gentle. And so we use this in the deep

448
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,040
sea. Um but you can see kind of we works

449
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,040
best with irregular, fragile, squishy,

450
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,040
topologically complex objects. And then

451
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,959
we hope to transition this to something

452
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,440
a little bit closer to home. But you can

453
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,639
imagine and as we have clearly found out

454
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,560
loud and clear from talking to uh

455
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,399
stakeholders, nobody really wants to be

456
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,440
uh approached by a squishy robot from

457
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,120
above. But we've been working with uh uh

458
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
physical therapists from Spalding Rehab

459
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,680
Hospital to think about ways where both

460
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,320
in parallel or when forced to kind of do

461
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,839
remote operation of physical therapy, we

462
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
can use some of these grippers to be

463
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,759
kind of a friendly and gentle way to add

464
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
kind of an intouch sense for

465
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
teleaalthcare.

466
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,399
So I'll thank the team that I work with

467
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
the soft robots and then move over to a

468
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,360
different material that I use in an

469
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,120
interesting and unusual way. And so my

470
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,839
group the fabrication integrated design

471
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,199
lab has been uh collaborating with even

472
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,640
line. And so even line is really only

473
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,240
two people. One of which was that

474
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,000
gentleman that you saw in the picture

475
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,160
longtime glass blowing partner of mine

476
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,039
and a colleague from undergrad. And

477
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,000
actually we then use a 3D printer which

478
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,480
he invented and I um basically consulted

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,720
on the first generation of we use a 3D

480
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,919
printer to then additively manufacture

481
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,400
structural masonry out of glass. And so

482
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,320
again I'm using an unusual material but

483
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
a lot of what I care about and I do

484
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,679
research on is then the manufacturing

485
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,840
and mechanical design side of this. Um

486
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,400
just kind of some context of where the

487
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,840
technology is. In 2015 was the first

488
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,720
printing of kind of like individual

489
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,480
units. In 2018 out of Ner Oxman's group

490
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,120
in the media lab at MIT then they built

491
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,679
a column for kind of a visual display.

492
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,200
And now most recently in 2024 we showed

493
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
how we can use this for structural

494
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,720
masonry. And so we're going from

495
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,559
individual unit again to column then to

496
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
an array. And actually what we're doing

497
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,559
in current research in collaboration

498
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,080
with TUD Delph is looking at the inner

499
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,600
layers of these because what we can do

500
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,960
is we can actually use recycled material

501
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,480
to prot to print structural masonry but

502
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,280
then the masonry itself can actually be

503
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,039
recycled again fully as long as the

504
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,320
inner layers then are completely

505
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,679
separable. So that's what we're working

506
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,520
on with TUD Delft. And again kind of so

507
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,120
this is a view of the printer and just

508
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,039
to give you a sense of kind of again

509
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,760
what I focus on is not just design for

510
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,760
manufacturing but looking at how the

511
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,760
design of an artifact comes from

512
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,679
functional requirements but then the

513
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,440
design of an artifact then defines the

514
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,160
process by which we make it and the

515
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,000
architecture of the 3D printer itself.

516
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
So some of what I'm talking about here

517
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
is for kind of terrestrial construction,

518
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,720
but then we've also looked into you can

519
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,880
actually take moon dust, moon dirt,

520
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
lunar regalith, and if you batch it

521
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,840
appropriately, melt it appropriately,

522
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,840
turn it into a glassy substance. So then

523
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,360
our printer looks very different if it's

524
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,960
an operating on the moon, both for

525
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,679
temperature reasons, but also clearly

526
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,280
environmental reasons as

527
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,520
well. Okay. So why would you potentially

528
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,679
want to use additive manufacturing for

529
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,120
glass, particularly structural glass?

530
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,280
Well, other than having aesthetic

531
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
freedom and design, you can actually

532
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
optimize each individual brick for

533
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,960
strength. So, if you have a brick kind

534
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
of at the base of your construction, it

535
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
needs to be fairly strong. It's

536
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
supporting all the load of the bricks

537
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,200
above it. But as you start to move up in

538
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,600
your structure, you can actually reduce

539
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,400
the amount of material that you use. So,

540
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,760
you're reducing material overall, but

541
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
then you're actually reducing weight,

542
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,039
which then further reduces how much

543
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,480
structural material you need on the

544
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,760
lower layers. And then also with uh the

545
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,280
printing method, we actually have an

546
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
atomically smooth printing surface

547
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,720
because we have fully melted the glass

548
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,240
and extruded it. And so then you get a

549
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,679
really high surface quality which is not

550
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,600
just nice from aesthetics but actually

551
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,679
lends itself to strength in the glass

552
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,840
itself. If you have glass that is free

553
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,400
of defects and scratches on the surface,

554
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,400
it will be stronger. And then by making

555
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,360
a discontinuous process, so we have a

556
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,880
smaller kiln for the glass printing and

557
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,559
then printing one brick at a time before

558
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,400
we start the next one. we can actually

559
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,160
experiment with more materials and

560
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
specifically recycled materials. So if

561
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,440
we're worried about contamination then

562
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
we actually have a much lower capital

563
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,160
risk than for example you would for

564
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,679
float lines. So we can actually be much

565
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,039
more experimental with the materials

566
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,559
that we use in this

567
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,240
process. We have some precedents that we

568
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,880
can look to for inspiration such as the

569
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,640
crystal house which was built in 2016 in

570
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
Amsterdam. We're actually working with a

571
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,159
couple of the engineers from this

572
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,080
project. So these are cast glass bricks

573
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,880
and the engineers we're working with um

574
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,520
Fedra and Tesla at are in the rework

575
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
group in uh TU Delft. So there's some of

576
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,960
the civil engineers that we're working

577
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,039
with in those inner layers. Um but we

578
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
can also look for inspiration in

579
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,520
concrete additive manufacturing from the

580
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,799
block group in ETHZurich. And so these

581
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,600
are actually printed masonry. They're

582
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,200
non uh reinforced that are used in kind

583
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,679
of compressive loading to create a

584
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,280
bridge.

585
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay. So then the question is how do we

586
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,559
turn glass bricks into some form that

587
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,799
can do the same thing as those concrete

588
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,720
bricks. So again taking some inspiration

589
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,760
from TUDalf we can start to make

590
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,679
something that looks a little bit like a

591
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,960
Lego

592
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,039
brick but there's some challenge in the

593
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,159
manufacturing there. So what we've done

594
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,679
is uh add essentially a standardized

595
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,159
what we call lovingly the peanut

596
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,559
structure with two studs on top. Why a

597
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
peanut? Why the same shape? I did just

598
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,760
tell you that one of the magical things

599
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,360
about additive manufacturing is that we

600
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,720
have a lot of design freedom and here

601
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm printing peanuts over and over

602
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
again. Well, I am also an engineer and

603
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
we wanted to do this to just have

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,559
standardization and to be able to do a

605
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
feasibility test. So, I apologize that

606
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,440
it's only the peanuts. You can imagine

607
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,200
that some of these have wonderful

608
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,799
fantastic surfaces printed on them as

609
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,559
well. Now, so we have the studs for

610
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,159
interlocking and lateral loading. Um,

611
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,480
but all of the vertical loading actually

612
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,320
trans transfers through the sides of the

613
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
bricks themselves. Like I said, we're

614
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,520
working on inner layers so that we can

615
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,760
completely reuse them and disassemble

616
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,880
them in between structures.

617
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,320
Um, and like I said, we we're keeping

618
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,679
these identical for now just for

619
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,960
testing. Okay. So, with that structure,

620
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,280
the hardest thing right now for us to

621
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,280
print is that little overhang, that

622
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,520
pesky little 90 degree turn between the

623
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,120
studs. Um, for those of you who are

624
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,480
familiar with 3D printing, this will be

625
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,000
obvious. For those of you who are not

626
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,760
familiar with 3D printing, you might

627
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
think I have two heads right now. Trust

628
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,720
me, it's a manufacturing uh challenge.

629
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,400
So, we have three different ways where

630
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,159
we're exploring how to do this. One is

631
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
skip it entirely. Just print a hollow

632
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,760
block and have something else. Let's say

633
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,360
a metal inner layer in between where you

634
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,760
can have them interlock or you could

635
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,280
have a print uh cast glass part. which

636
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,960
then led us to the next option is like

637
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,960
oh well what if we actually have a

638
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,039
hybrid manufacturing technique where we

639
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,039
both print glass and then cast into it.

640
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,880
I'll come back to this. Um and then we

641
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,960
have finally figured out how to fully

642
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,360
print

643
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,960
this. So if I look at these peanuts and

644
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
cross-section where I have this kind of

645
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,520
light green gray is printed glass and

646
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,159
then where there's black is cast is what

647
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,159
I'm trying to portray here. And this is

648
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,840
what it looks like as we're looking into

649
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,039
the machine and having these kind of

650
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,039
coil pots of glass

651
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,720
printed. So for the hollow unit, it's

652
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,240
just entirely printed. We cut off the

653
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,120
top and the bottom. We polish a little

654
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,840
bit. We're done.

655
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,039
Easy. For the print and cast method, we

656
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,600
start again with a fully hollow

657
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,840
unit and then we place it on top of a

658
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,360
graphite mold and then actually cast

659
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,320
into it.

660
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,679
So the nice thing about this is that we

661
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,679
actually get a higher a tighter

662
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,159
tolerance from casting than we can get

663
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,400
from the printing. But then it also

664
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,320
gives us ideas of well if we wanted to

665
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
cast glass and get more adventurous with

666
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,240
the forms that we're casting. Normally

667
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,480
with cast glass I have to make a mold.

668
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,880
If I want a different form I need a

669
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,640
different mold again. And so that's both

670
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,440
a consumable but also something that at

671
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,760
the end of the day um creates waste. So

672
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,640
in this case, you can create or print

673
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,080
custom forms and cast into them. So your

674
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,919
tooling becomes part of the final

675
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,440
product and does not contribute to

676
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,360
waste. Okay, so here's a picture of our

677
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,919
final cast brick printed on the sides,

678
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,760
cast on the bottom, and then we have the

679
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,440
fully printed brick. We use the same

680
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,000
graphite mold. We put it in the printer,

681
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,400
we print on

682
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,600
top. So here we

683
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,279
go. And then we have the three bricks.

684
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,919
Again, I realize it's very hard to see

685
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,320
those because I'm taking a picture of a

686
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,360
clear thing on a white

687
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,039
background. Um, but then the next step

688
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,919
is then of course to do some mechanical

689
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,679
testing. Will these actually stand

690
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,360
alone? So we tested these both as if

691
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,880
they were stacked in a column, but more

692
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,799
importantly to start building kind of

693
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,120
larger structures and walls as if they

694
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,520
were spanning two bricks above and

695
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,440
below. So I have that accomplished

696
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,720
essentially in aluminum fixtures. And

697
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,880
then we put the aluminum fixture around

698
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,799
the brick and crush it with a lot of

699
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,799
pressure. And so the first thing that

700
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,240
you're going to see is the initial

701
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,640
fracture. And so we track when that

702
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,840
first fracture

703
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,720
happens. And then we keep loading it

704
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,720
until there's no brick

705
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,960
left. Wait for

706
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,039
it. Okay, that seems scary. But the

707
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,039
difference in those two loads is quite

708
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,279
substantial. So the nice thing we see

709
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,520
here

710
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:33,440
is you have a lot of uh loadbearing

711
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,840
capacity to begin with kind of

712
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,840
approaching with just the hollow units

713
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,240
the sort of stress that we could sustain

714
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,360
with concrete. Um but then there is also

715
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,960
a very big jump to ultimate failure

716
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,880
because it's not about with glass or

717
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,600
even concrete whether something will

718
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
break. In every building, in almost any

719
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,600
material, something will break. And so,

720
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,440
it's about designing for redundancy and

721
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
having indicators of when you might have

722
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,320
a risk. And so, a we already have plenty

723
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,279
of strength for this to be a structural

724
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,200
material. But then, we also have plenty

725
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,640
of warning if there is an initial

726
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
failure and time to then remove that

727
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,159
brick and put something else in its

728
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,320
place. By the way, if we remove that

729
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,400
brick, we can put it right back in the

730
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,279
printer and print again. So, all of that

731
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,520
material can be reclaimed.

732
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,880
And so we look at kind of then from this

733
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,520
these are really early studies. Remember

734
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,200
I showed you this was 2024. So just last

735
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,480
year is when we started using this for a

736
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,919
structural material. So now what we're

737
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,279
doing is diagnosing kind of what are the

738
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,880
different factors that actually affect

739
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,000
strength. I won't go into the details

740
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,960
but if you're curious you can ask me

741
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,039
another time. Basically a lot of the

742
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,640
post-processing is a big factor. So how

743
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,159
did we grind it? How much did we polish

744
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
it? What surface do we print it on?

745
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,600
These are all very important things that

746
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,360
really highly affect the strength of the

747
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
brick. Remember I said if you have a

748
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,960
pristine if you have a perfect surface

749
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,559
you have a stronger piece of glass. As

750
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,400
soon as you scratch it then you have to

751
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,679
start worrying about okay do I have a

752
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,960
different strength

753
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,120
performance other things you know this

754
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,600
was a very manual process and so we have

755
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,600
defects you saw my colleague then

756
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,960
casting into our printed brick we have

757
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,880
small defects for where the casting

758
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,960
didn't fill entirely. Turns out these

759
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,400
also can then affect the performance

760
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,080
which is part of why we see the fully

761
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,159
hollow unit is something that then

762
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,600
performed much better and again why

763
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,200
we're working with TUD Delve to then

764
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,480
work first with the hollow units and

765
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,919
then we'll revisit some of these

766
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,120
hybrids. The next thing to go through

767
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,960
then is um just printing with recycled

768
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,440
glass. So we've actually been able to

769
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,120
use bottle glass. So like these Bombay

770
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,799
Sapphire gin bottles that I have taken

771
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,720
the label off of because I can't show

772
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,960
them. Um, but it's a really lovely blue

773
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,559
to print out of. Um, so we batch those

774
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,000
and print those into bricks. We've also

775
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,760
used float glass. So my colleague

776
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,279
Michael Stern, who's uh the founder of

777
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,960
Evenline, is a artist and residence at

778
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,400
Pilington. So we've gotten Pilington

779
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,960
float glass that we've then printed into

780
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,799
bricks. Um, I'll spare you the uh

781
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,039
calibration between different materials,

782
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,640
but not all glass is the same. They melt

783
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,080
at different temperatures, but we can

784
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,320
then calibrate by having the same

785
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,000
temperature or different temperatures to

786
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,799
achieve the same viscosity is what we

787
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,399
really care about. Um, but then a more

788
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,840
artistic demonstration of this

789
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,279
calibration are these three pieces

790
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,600
printed in three different types of

791
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,960
glass. The first is a studio color that

792
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,960
you would use as a glass blower. The

793
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,679
second is Bombay Sapphire gin bottles.

794
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,440
The third is a float glass. And if we

795
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,120
zoom in, what we've done is essentially

796
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
while in line and printing, we actually

797
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,159
just jog the nozzle off a little bit and

798
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
then come back on. let a little bit of

799
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,919
the glass drip down the sides. My

800
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,799
colleague calls this uh kind of the

801
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,039
series of ticks. And if we look then

802
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,720
comparing those to the three objects,

803
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,640
you can see kind of with the cooling

804
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
time and viscosity combined, we actually

805
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,679
get the same result from those three

806
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,880
glasses, giving us some confidence

807
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,600
visually that we've been able to

808
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,760
calibrate the machine. The last thing

809
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
that printing with recycled float glass

810
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,520
buys us is again an opportunity to work

811
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,840
with a hybrid setup where we can

812
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,679
actually print directly onto flat glass.

813
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,840
So, we've actually cut up one sample

814
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,399
here, um, and are still in the process

815
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,480
of testing some of those joints. Um, but

816
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,399
you can see that a we can both print

817
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,640
directly on flat glass, but we can also

818
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,840
and preserve its flatness. We can then

819
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,679
also preserve some of the high

820
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,600
temperature coatings that Pilington puts

821
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,039
on their glass for a nice either visual

822
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,760
and/or functional effect. Lastly, we can

823
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,200
use these then for facades um, both for

824
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,360
kind of decoration, but also then

825
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,520
stiffening in the face of load shear or

826
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,679
wind shear, excuse me. Um, and then can

827
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,200
print some of our bricks uh directly on

828
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,919
flat glass. It's hard to see, but there

829
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,440
is a piece of flat glass on the front

830
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,520
there, which can then get assembled. So,

831
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,760
this is an osteomorphic shape inspired

832
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
by the TU Delft group. Um, and then some

833
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,840
of where this is going is then working

834
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,679
in both um kind of glass, but also

835
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,760
collaborating with a group at MIT. And

836
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,840
this is a rendering that they made where

837
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,679
if I could gesture at the like columns

838
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,760
with a pointer, I don't think I can.

839
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,960
Um, go

840
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,480
back then. And basically those are all

841
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,159
made from modular reusable concrete uh

842
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,080
units. And so basically in this

843
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,720
rendering all of the concrete supports

844
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,240
and glass are reclaimable and reusable

845
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,559
and with the glass and they are also

846
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,120
then fully

847
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:08,960
remeltable. And so with that um we'll

848
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
take if you have I we may not have time

849
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,480
for questions. I realize we've run over

850
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,159
so maybe you all want to get to eat but

851
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
I will at least say thank you to my

852
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,940
group and thank you to you all for

853
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,320
listening.

854
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:26,480
[Applause]

855
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,520
Well, thank you very very much, Dr.

856
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Becker. And I think maybe we'll keep the

857
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,080
Well, we have one question. Uh, do you

858
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,880
see potential for scaling this

859
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,840
integrated design model beyond research

860
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,159
labs and into industrial settings? If

861
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,760
so, what are the barriers? Um, I think

862
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,360
some of those were probably training and

863
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,279
that's something that I'll talk about a

864
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,799
little bit in the workshop tomorrow. So,

865
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,640
it's something that um Dr. Leu and I

866
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,120
actually work on in some of the

867
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,799
manufacturing classes at MIT and trying

868
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,919
to get students more fluid with the

869
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
transfer between design and

870
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,799
manufacturing. And I think we're up

871
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,399
against a little bit of kind of not just

872
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,919
kind of resorting to, oh, you can Google

873
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,760
that, but really having them kind of

874
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,600
feel the physics and see the consequence

875
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,279
as you move back and forth. I think some

876
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
of these were hard learned lessons um

877
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,720
for me that I really appreciated from

878
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,399
working in industry. But then we can

879
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,120
build some of that into our classes by

880
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,919
having very hands-on programming. And so

881
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,120
maybe similar I think industry has its

882
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,720
own opportunities for teaching. You

883
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,799
don't have to fabricate those, but at

884
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,919
least kind of starting with engineers

885
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,039
coming from uh uni or college that have

886
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
some of those built into their

887
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,039
experience. So they have a framework to

888
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,159
start with. That sounds great. Thank you

889
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,159
so much. And
