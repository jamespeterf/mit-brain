00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
We're lucky to have MIT in Boston and

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,839
we're lucky it draws the people that it

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
does. People like you from around the

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,160
world. This world has some problems that

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
we need you to drop everything and

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
solve. There is a lot of trouble out

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,320
there, MIT. But there's a lot of beauty,

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,560
too. And I hope you see both. But

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
whatever you do, just keep listening,

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,240
even to people you don't agree with at

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
all. I love what President Obama said at

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,920
Howard University's commencement last

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
month. He said, "Democracy requires

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,519
compromise even when you are 100%

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
right." I heard that and thought, "Here

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,880
is a man who has been happily married

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
for a long

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,160
time. I hope you'll turn toward the

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,239
problem of your choosing. I hope you'll

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,399
drop everything, and I hope you'll solve

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,719
it. This is your life, class of

22
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,559
2016. This is your moment, and it is all

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,559
down to you. Thank you.

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,559
Congratulations."
