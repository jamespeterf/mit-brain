1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,039
So last time just quickly recall we

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,359
looked at a function on some interval

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,600
into R.

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,560
We looked at uh a partition P. So here

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,439
we have the interval from A to B. Then

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
we have a partition x0

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,760
x1

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,320
up to say xn.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,800
We looked at uh mi which was the soup

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,680
on this little interval here from x i

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,760
minus one to x i of f. We looked at

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,879
little mi which was the in

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,879
f here was bounded again

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,840
uh and in on the same interval x i minus

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,000
one 2x i

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,439
and then we looked at the upper and the

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,520
lower sum. So we looked at the uh upper

18
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,240
and lower sum

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,680
with respect to this partition. So this

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,720
here was the sum of mi and then delta xi

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,759
and the lower sum

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,840
for this partition which was the sum of

23
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:33,360
this small mi delta xi where the delta

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,320
xi was the length of this these little

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,840
intervals here

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,640
like that. Right? And then it was reman

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,079
integral. Then we looked at the the

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,040
lower and the upper reman integral.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,479
So we looked at the

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,520
upper and lower reman integral.

31
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,840
This here was now the in

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:07,560
of uh these upper integrals

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,560
over all partition and the lower one

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,879
that was the soup.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,879
of the lower

36
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,120
sums

37
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,360
over all partitions.

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,360
And then we said that f is reman

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,360
integral

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,200
uh if if those two numbers are the same.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,840
If the upper one here which is always

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,959
big or equal to the lower one if that is

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,560
actually equal to the lower one the

44
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,319
lower reman integral right

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,519
and and if this is the case right so if

46
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,360
this here is it's it's reman integral if

47
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,000
and only if these two numbers are the

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,280
same in that case we wrote for this

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,959
common number we wrote just the uh we

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,920
wrote it as as a reman integral

51
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,360
So now

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,440
there was this parallel to things we've

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,159
done before. There was these algebraic

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,280
rules for that we talked about at the

55
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:18,159
very end. So what were there th those?

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Uh if you take a function

57
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,200
that is reman integraable

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,840
uh and you take c is a constant.

59
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,239
Then uh then the product here is also

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,239
reman integral

61
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,799
and the integral of the product is just

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:51,200
product function is just the product of

63
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:55,440
c with the uh with the reman integral of

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,519
f. Right? So that was one.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,040
two is that if you have a second

66
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,760
function, so in addition to f, you also

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,720
have a g and they're both reman

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,519
integral.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,519
Then the then the sum here is also reman

70
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,519
integral

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:24,720
and the integral of the sum

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,000
is is equal to

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,639
uh from a to b is equal to the sum of

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,639
the remman integral.

75
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,960
Let's prove this one here.

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,960
I won't prove the first one, but let's

77
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
prove the second one. Right? So, this is

78
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,199
true.

79
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,320
Now to prove this, let me remind you

80
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:54,000
about one of the one of the uh one of

81
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,960
the lemas that we had last time that we

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,639
was talking about that this was a useful

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,280
lema to determine whether a function was

84
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,720
remman integraable. So, so recall this

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,720
from last time

86
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:15,759
that uh you have the following lema

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:19,240
that um f again is bounded. So f is

88
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,240
reman integral

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,520
if and only if

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,479
uh for all for all epsilon greater than

91
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,160
zero there exist a partition of this

92
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,639
interval here such that

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,919
the upper sum which is always bigger

94
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,320
uh than the lower sum

95
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,919
this one here minus

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,000
the lower sum. So this number is always

97
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,120
positive. But if for all epsilon

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,880
you can make this difference here

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
smaller than right you can find a

100
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
partition so that you have that to prove

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:08,039
that last time.

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,039
So now let's go to the proof of this.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,720
So proof of true.

104
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:26,080
So since so uh given

105
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:31,960
given epsilon greater than zero

106
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,960
since uh f here is reman integral

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,560
then there exist a partition p1

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,080
um such that

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
the

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,919
upper

111
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
sum

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,199
minus the lower sum

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,720
is less than epsilon / two. Right? This

114
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,400
is because the function f was remand

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,400
integraable. And likewise

116
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
likewise

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,160
likewise since G is remman integraable

118
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,160
so there exist

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
uh exist

120
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,080
a second partition

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,919
P2. So that uh for G you have the same

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,360
thing

123
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:30,400
for G and P2. Sorry this is G.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,440
this upper sum minus the lower sum for G

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,880
with respect to this second partition.

126
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,080
This here is less than epsilon / two

127
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,759
right now.

128
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,759
So now you let P here.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,720
So now let

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,720
let P be the partition

131
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,639
that

132
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,639
has all the dividing points

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,120
uh points

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,039
of P1 together with

135
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,639
all the dividing points

136
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:36,399
uh of P2, right? So, so it has it has

137
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,719
the partitions that are in either one of

138
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,640
the two, right?

139
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,200
Or both, right?

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:50,600
And so now we know that so this is means

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:50,600
that so so P here is a refinement

142
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,680
of both

143
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,240
P1 and P2

144
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,480
right so this means that actually when

145
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,000
you're looking at this if you're looking

146
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,519
at this upper

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,560
sum minus this lower sum. Remember that

148
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,680
if you go to a refinement then this hair

149
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,839
goes down and this hair go up. So it

150
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:27,880
means that this difference here will be

151
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:27,880
less or equal to what it is for for P P1

152
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,040
and this was of course less than epsilon

153
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,000
over two. That was how it was chosen.

154
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,920
And similarly, if you're looking at the

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,920
upper sum for G

156
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,760
with respect to P, P here is a

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,320
refinement of P2 also. Right? So this

158
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,040
means that you have that this difference

159
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,600
here

160
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:08,320
is less or equal to the upper sum of G

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,800
with respect to P2 minus this lower sum

162
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,320
with respect to P2 and that's less than

163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,839
epsilon / two

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:24,720
right but this means now that if you now

165
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,720
take the so now if you take so now

166
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,950
[Applause]

167
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:41,360
So now if you take the an interval here

168
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:45,040
of uh this is from x i minus one to x i

169
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,480
if you're looking at this sum here you

170
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,640
had to be a little bit careful here

171
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,160
right but if you're looking at the sum

172
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,160
on this interval right the sum here is

173
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:00,399
less are equal to the soup of what f is.

174
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,760
This is you know this is on on on this

175
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,680
interval here right on this interval

176
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,680
this function here is less than the soup

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,720
of f plus the soup of g on the same

178
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
interval.

179
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,959
Right?

180
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:29,560
And it's of course bigger equal to

181
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,560
what it is the in

182
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,399
of f plus the in of g on that same

183
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,399
interval.

184
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,399
Why do I say you had to be a little bit

185
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:53,839
careful is that the in of the sum could

186
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,920
be strictly larger than this and it

187
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,519
could be strictly less than that. Right?

188
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,880
But you certainly have this statement,

189
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,160
right? But just thinking about if if f

190
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,839
and g was the same up to a sign, right?

191
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,880
If g was like minus f, right? Then the

192
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,040
sum would be dead zero. But you know one

193
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,279
of the function may be negative on this

194
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
interval and the other one was positive

195
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,000
right? So, so you see for the sum here

196
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
could be dead zero but these two numbers

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
one would be positive the other would be

198
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
negative right but you certainly have

199
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,920
this inequality right and so of course

200
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,839
this implies

201
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,639
that the on this interval the soup of

202
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,680
the sum here

203
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,000
is less than the soup

204
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,480
of of of

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,480
the the sum of the soups

206
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,480
some of the soups on the same intervals

207
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,920
and and likewise

208
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,920
uh for the in right.

209
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,279
So you have this thing here and you have

210
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,720
that this thing here is clearly bigger

211
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,680
or equal to the in of the same function.

212
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,720
So which is the sum of the two on this

213
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,360
interval here.

214
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,760
And that is of course bigger than than

215
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,760
than this sum here.

216
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Right?

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:40,880
So, so this here this number here right

218
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,440
you see this here is like m i for the

219
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,040
function f right this is what this

220
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:51,920
number is right and this here is like

221
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:56,320
this number here is like capital m i for

222
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,680
the function g right and this here this

223
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,120
here is like little this here is like

224
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,560
little m i for the function f and this

225
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,800
number here is little m i for the

226
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:14,000
function g. So what we have here is

227
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,880
that's uh mi

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,880
for f plus sorry let me let me write it

229
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,880
uh

230
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,519
let me write it over here.

231
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,830
[Applause]

232
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,720
So what we have is that we have little

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:46,000
mi for the function f plus little m i

234
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:50,720
for the function g is less or equal to

235
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,480
little m i for the sum

236
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,920
which is of course less than soup of the

237
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,639
same sum on the same interval. So this

238
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,120
is this

239
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:11,760
and that's less or equal to the soup of

240
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:15,199
f on that interval plus this here of g

241
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,519
right so you have that inequality

242
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,399
but now you see that this means of

243
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,680
course that the contribution so if

244
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,959
you're looking at this upper

245
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,360
sum for this

246
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,880
This upper sum for the sum of these two

247
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,160
functions

248
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,160
with respect to P

249
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,279
this here the contribution you get is

250
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,360
for the upper you get this and for the

251
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,519
lower you would get

252
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,480
you get this here times the length of

253
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,079
the interval right

254
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,800
so this is

255
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
so again so what you get from on that

256
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,759
little interval the contribution you get

257
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,720
is like m i f + g

258
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:12,959
um times the length of the interval.

259
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,040
This is this minus m i f + g times the

260
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,959
length of the interval. This is the

261
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,720
contribution that you get here from this

262
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,279
interval from this little interval.

263
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,639
Right?

264
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:30,399
And because this number here is less

265
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:39,920
than that then this here is less than

266
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:42,079
uh m i f plus m i g time delta xi

267
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,079
minus

268
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,880
and then this thing here you see this

269
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,440
the spread between these two here bounce

270
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:59,440
the spread between those two. So this is

271
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:01,839
less than m i f plus m i little m i g *

272
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,439
delta xi

273
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,360
right so right and now you're summing

274
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,360
over everything right so this means that

275
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,600
this thing here is so this and you and

276
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,360
if you just split this here this sum

277
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,959
here you can just split that into two

278
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,880
parts the mi

279
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:27,679
times uh delta

280
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,679
X I minus little MI F * delta XI and

281
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:35,200
then plus

282
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:44,240
um capital M I G delta XI

283
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:46,880
minus little M I G delta XI right so

284
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:52,400
when you're summing these up

285
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,640
you get uh U FP

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:01,039
that's from this here. What when you're

287
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:03,760
summing these up UM FP minus sorry L F P

288
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:11,760
right when you're summing these up then

289
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:16,400
you're getting U G P minus uh L

290
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,480
f L uh G P

291
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,080
right?

292
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,080
And so what you get here is

293
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,679
again when you're summing it up this

294
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,400
here

295
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,000
gives you when you sum this up then you

296
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,760
get this. When you sum this hair up you

297
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,440
get that. When you sum this up you get

298
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:47,679
that. So summing everything up you get u

299
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:51,600
f + g comma this partition minus l f

300
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:56,160
plus g with respect to this partition is

301
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:00,400
less or equal to u f with respect to

302
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:10,160
this partition minus l f respect to the

303
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:13,600
partition p plus uh u G P minus L G P

304
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,400
right so you're getting that right

305
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,520
and this thing here

306
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,840
it was a refinement of the partition P1

307
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,200
so this spread here is less than what it

308
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,480
was for P1 so this here is less than

309
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,440
epsilon over two and likewise this here

310
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,440
is a refinement of the partition P2 so

311
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,720
the spread here is less than what it is

312
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,640
for P2 two. So you're getting this and

313
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,440
so this here is epsilon, right? And so

314
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,760
this gives you the partition and so

315
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,440
there's two syncs, right? You have to be

316
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,919
careful with that, you know, for one

317
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
function you get one partition. For the

318
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,679
other function, you get another

319
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,559
partition. So you're looking at the at

320
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,440
the sub partition that has all of the

321
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,919
dividing points of both of them. And the

322
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,160
other things you had to be careful is

323
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,160
about and that was embedded here it was

324
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,240
uh but it was actually more clearly on

325
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,960
one of the other board is that when

326
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,960
you're looking at two functions and

327
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,200
you're looking at a little interval and

328
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,160
you're taking like the soup of the two

329
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,400
of the sum then that's bounded by the

330
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,480
sum of the soup but it's not like equal

331
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,679
to the sum right you know and likewise

332
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,679
for the in right yeah

333
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,919
I mean, so the there's not uh but the

334
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,480
reason there's not is that once you have

335
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,919
this sort of general framework, you

336
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,039
wouldn't really get back to the

337
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,799
partition actually. So you know if it

338
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:54,400
was I mean yeah I mean you know once you

339
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:58,559
sort of have this solid foundations

340
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,159
then you just write uh I mean you just

341
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:06,400
write the integral fine yeah and and so

342
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:11,919
so so just to just on that note right

343
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,480
this dx this is right so it's it's so

344
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,950
this here

345
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,600
Um

346
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:22,400
[Applause]

347
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,760
um

348
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,480
this here is uh right this here is like

349
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,400
uh is referring this is like a giant s

350
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:36,400
right so it's referred to summation

351
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,880
this here is of course a d and and and

352
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,039
delta right is a Greek letter for d and

353
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,159
so this here you should think about this

354
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:49,960
here is referring to sort of some sort

355
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,960
of limits of these uh delta xi.

356
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:59,919
Okay. So, so that was uh let me just uh

357
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:07,240
talk a little bit about uh the other two

358
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:07,240
um uh rules. So one of the other one is

359
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,679
one of the other ones is that if you

360
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,240
take two functions

361
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,360
f and g again.

362
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,480
So you have so number three here was

363
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,640
that if you have f and g they are both

364
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,640
integral on this interval here

365
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,760
and uh f here is lesser equal to g then

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,280
it implies that the integral here is

367
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,440
lesser or equal to

368
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,080
the integral

369
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,760
of g

370
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,159
and that's I won't prove this. sort of

371
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,480
in a way I mean maybe I'll just say

372
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,640
words right that if you take a partition

373
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,320
then of course you're looking at some x

374
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,919
i minus one and x i some interval like

375
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,400
this

376
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,880
and so if you're looking at the function

377
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,480
f and you're looking at the soup of the

378
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,799
function f on this little interval well

379
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,760
then obviously

380
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,559
this soup here is less than the soup of

381
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,600
of of just because you have this

382
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,480
inequality everywhere, right? And so

383
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,440
this means that the and likewise for the

384
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,600
int and so you see that it's kind of

385
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,919
this inequality

386
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,720
you have to you know of course make it

387
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,799
nice into a mathematical proof but this

388
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,200
inequality will seem kind of obvious

389
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,039
right?

390
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,679
Uh

391
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:46,000
let me instead try prove uh that if you

392
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:51,120
split the interval up into pieces

393
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,919
uh then you can just sum the pieces.

394
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,919
So this is the following.

395
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,039
So, so again in the notes which I

396
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,679
haven't I forgot to post but I I will

397
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,400
post I guess these are posted because

398
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,200
these is from from these are things we

399
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,000
didn't quite do yet last time. Uh and

400
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,520
but but the proofs

401
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,600
of all of these four here also the one

402
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,400
in particular like the one this one here

403
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,200
I didn't do now. Uh they are all the

404
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,960
proofs are all in the notes.

405
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,840
So number four here is that if you take

406
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:36,080
a function and it's integraable on some

407
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,919
interval like this, it's bounded always

408
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,039
bounded

409
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,520
and you're looking at the integral here

410
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,520
of this function

411
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:53,279
and C here is C is somewhere between so

412
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:57,279
C is lying between A and B.

413
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:01,279
Well then actually um and then actually

414
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,919
let me just before write down this then

415
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,720
the function here if you thinking about

416
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,400
restricting the function to the smaller

417
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,640
interval from a to c it's also

418
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,240
integraable there

419
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,320
and likewise uh if you restrict it to

420
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,200
the integral

421
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,919
from C to D to B then it's also

422
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,360
integraable here. So it's integral

423
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,039
integraable on both these sub intervals.

424
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,200
And

425
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:37,360
and you have that the integral here of f

426
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,960
is dx

427
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,760
is equal to the sum

428
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,760
uh of the integrals

429
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,799
like that. Okay.

430
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,760
And so now why is this the case?

431
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
So

432
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,320
so this is just because if you take

433
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,279
So let's see. So

434
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,000
Right. So now let's try to prove then.

435
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:43,080
So

436
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,080
right so if so I want to look at the

437
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:52,480
um right. So, so let me first let me

438
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,720
first prove that if it is integral here,

439
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,600
it's also integraable on these two sub

440
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,480
intervals, right? And then once you know

441
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:08,240
uh through um in that proof, we will

442
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:11,120
also see uh what that sum is equal to.

443
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,159
So I again use this lema from before

444
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,760
that all I do need is to for a given

445
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:20,320
epsilon I need to find a partition. So

446
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,919
uh so that the spread between the upper

447
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,360
and the lower sum is um for each of

448
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,760
these two is bounded by epsilon. So

449
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,760
given epsilon

450
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,279
uh we since

451
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,840
f here is integraable

452
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:45,120
on the integral from a to b.

453
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,120
We know that there exist there exist a

454
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:53,100
partition p such that

455
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,279
the uh upper sum

456
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,480
[Applause]

457
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,480
uh minus the lower sum

458
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,679
is less than epsilon.

459
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:12,000
Now I then I look at a refinement. So

460
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:15,440
here I have A, here I have B and and

461
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,039
here I have C. And then I have some

462
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
partition

463
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,720
but it's a partition may not have C as a

464
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,880
dividing point. Right? So I'm looking at

465
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,440
so let's

466
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
let's uh

467
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,290
let P star

468
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,390
uh be the refinement

469
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,390
[Applause]

470
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,640
that

471
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,640
in addition

472
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,520
to all the dividing points.

473
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,480
uh of P

474
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,320
also

475
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,000
have

476
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,200
C

477
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,200
as a dividing point.

478
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,960
Okay, so it has one more dividing point.

479
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,360
I mean of course it may be that C was

480
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,640
already there then you don't then then

481
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,919
this partition is fine right

482
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,399
and so now of course now the thing is

483
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,720
that once you have that well first of

484
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,799
all you have this is refinement so you

485
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,039
still have so you may as well just think

486
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,640
so so you have this inequality so you

487
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:48,240
have that u of f comma p star

488
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,559
is minus l of f p star is is also

489
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,679
strictly less than epsilon, right? This

490
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,640
because it's refinement of B.

491
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,840
And so now you're looking at at the

492
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:05,039
piece. So this thing here but this thing

493
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:11,840
here this thing here is just equal to

494
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:13,360
this here is simply equal to u uh f of p

495
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,080
star

496
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,640
intersected with

497
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,399
a c

498
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,080
plus

499
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,840
u

500
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,559
p

501
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:32,240
u p star intersected with the interval

502
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:35,039
from C to B. Right? By this here, when

503
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,279
I'm taking the position partition and I

504
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,320
intersected with the interval, I'm just

505
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,240
thinking about the the part of the

506
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,600
partition that is dividing this interval

507
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,919
up. Right? So you have this and likewise

508
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,240
this thing here

509
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:58,399
is is the sum this one here is the sum

510
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,520
of the partition the lower sum the sum

511
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,600
of the two lower sums

512
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,840
which is this

513
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,360
A to C

514
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,600
plus

515
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,000
L f

516
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:17,039
P star

517
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,919
of uh of C to be

518
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,919
like that. Okay.

519
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,760
And so this of course means that so now

520
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,799
you can split this up and you can divide

521
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,600
right. So you have this is equal to this

522
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:37,519
sum. This here is equal to that sum. So

523
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,240
you can just rearrange it so that that

524
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,399
the upper sum. So you have so this means

525
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:48,399
that this whole thing here is equal to

526
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:52,240
u f p star

527
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,960
intersected with a comma c

528
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,960
minus and then I take this one here

529
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:05,200
next. So, uh, L

530
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:09,960
F P star intersected with A C.

531
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,960
And then I take plus this one here.

532
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,240
And then I take the last one, which is

533
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,000
this one here. And it's again it comes

534
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,279
with a minus sign. So, minus L.

535
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,080
F P star

536
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,640
uh intersected with

537
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,559
C V

538
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,840
like that. Okay. And but each of these

539
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:46,240
things here this here is is is non

540
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:50,320
negative. This here is non negative.

541
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,279
And you see the the sum of these two

542
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,519
numbers is bounded by epsilon. just

543
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,840
means that each of them must be at most

544
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,640
epsilon, right? Yeah.

545
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:06,399
>> Explain what you did to break up into

546
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,880
>> Okay. So,

547
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,880
so I have

548
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,200
I have here the interval.

549
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,640
Um

550
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:30,000
I have here the interval from A to B.

551
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,200
Um here I have C

552
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,600
and the star partition is the one that

553
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,320
has all of the dividing points of the

554
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:43,360
original partition P and then also C. So

555
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,159
the partition looks like this.

556
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,320
Maybe this here would be the partition.

557
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:54,320
And now I'm thinking about so the the

558
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,440
sum here in the the sum from the star

559
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,159
partition it would look like this and

560
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,480
I'm summing over all I right but I can

561
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,879
look at where I'm summing over just

562
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,480
those interval up to here

563
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,960
right I can look at where I'm just

564
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,639
summing over this interval and then I

565
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,119
can look at where I'm summing over those

566
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,359
interval Right? And so that's what I

567
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,879
mean. So this here is now where you're

568
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,599
summing over all the I but but you can

569
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,919
also just summing over the eyes that are

570
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,480
lesser equal to C and the eyes that are

571
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,480
you know in this range right okay so

572
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,480
that's

573
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,079
okay. So, so this here proves

574
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:47,040
this here. So, what this prove is that

575
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:50,480
if you take uh this function

576
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,960
and is integraable on this interval

577
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,760
and you now restrict it to either of

578
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,480
those, they are also integraable. Right?

579
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,280
That's what it actually proves. But it's

580
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,880
easy to see that uh that it it also with

581
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,640
a little bit maybe I'll leave this for

582
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,280
you. Uh but it but that that through the

583
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,119
proof we also get that this sum here

584
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,599
will have to be equal to the sum of

585
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,599
these two right but really what I

586
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,800
technically speaking proved was just

587
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,960
this part here. Okay.

588
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,079
But again the it's the all of the

589
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,040
details for this are in the in the

590
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:34,160
notes. Okay.

591
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:38,079
Um now the next thing I want to Okay. So

592
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:43,960
yeah. So I I I I will um let's talk

593
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,960
about one other uh one corner of this.

594
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,839
So it's the corner really not of this

595
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,920
fourth property but on the third

596
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,800
property.

597
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,800
So the third property was this wheel.

598
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,000
So the third property was this property

599
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,119
here over here. So I want to talk about

600
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,119
a corate of this one.

601
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,040
So now I have a function. I'm assuming

602
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,599
both the function and the function that

603
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,760
is the absolute value. So the function

604
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,119
that's absolute value means that at each

605
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,920
point instead of looking at f ofx I'm

606
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,839
looking at the absolute value of f ofx.

607
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,720
This is the function. So I'm assuming

608
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,240
that both of these functions are reman

609
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,760
integral

610
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,760
on this integral from a to b.

611
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:52,960
And then the claim is that the that the

612
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,119
integral here of f is lesser equal dx

613
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,960
sorry

614
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,960
is lesser equal to the integral from a

615
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,440
this is a very ex this is

616
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,440
very simple inequality but extremely

617
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,359
useful. So this is the claim right. So

618
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm already assuming that things are

619
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,599
everything is remman integraable. So I

620
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,599
don't need to to prove anything like

621
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,720
that. I just need to establish this

622
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,480
inequality. And so to do that I'm just

623
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,200
looking at f. Well f is less or equal to

624
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,359
the absolute value. If f is positive

625
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,359
it's equal to the absolute value. If

626
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,480
it's negative this here is non negative

627
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:38,200
anyway. So so so this is clear. This is

628
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,200
clearly for all x.

629
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,920
But it's also clear that if I take minus

630
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,320
f you see this is also less than this

631
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,880
right

632
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,480
but now taken together so those two

633
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,720
things

634
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,079
so now the first one so

635
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,920
so let's say star here and double star

636
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,720
here

637
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,720
it's just star here

638
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,240
plus properties three from from over

639
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:19,359
there. This just give us that integral

640
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:24,079
of f from a to b dx is less or equal to

641
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:27,760
the integral of the absolute value.

642
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:32,119
Right? This is from star and tree. But

643
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,119
if we take double star here

644
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:40,480
+ three well then we have that

645
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,520
uh right so this here so we have that

646
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:48,079
the integral of minus f dx is less or

647
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,320
equal to the integral

648
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,320
like this

649
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,960
right but this one here is you can just

650
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,839
think about this here as minus1. This is

651
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,359
like minus1

652
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,040
times this function, right? So minus one

653
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,720
just comes out. That was like number

654
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:15,440
one. So this here is like minus1

655
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,520
times the integral from a to b of f dx.

656
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,520
But this is of course the same as minus

657
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:25,359
the integral from a to b f dx. Right? So

658
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:29,119
you see that so this here so this so the

659
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:33,760
second here implies that minus the

660
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:38,680
integral from a to b f dx is less or

661
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,680
equal to this thing here

662
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,320
right and so now you have this thing

663
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,320
here and that thing here and so together

664
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,440
it just means that the absolute value of

665
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:56,839
this is bounded by this

666
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,839
And so that's really this column. Okay.

667
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,000
The next thing I want to talk about, so

668
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,400
this is how to evaluate integrals,

669
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,280
right? And so there you have this the

670
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,280
fundamental theorem of countness.

671
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,359
And so we give two versions of that.

672
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,920
So

673
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,920
how to evaluate

674
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,920
uh integrals.

675
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,000
And so this is the fundamental theorem

676
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,000
of calc.

677
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,920
Okay. And now what does the fundamental

678
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,760
theorem of calculus? So let's skip

679
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,400
version one.

680
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,400
So version one,

681
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,480
version one is that if you take um uh if

682
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:10,839
you take a function uh f

683
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,839
and f here is continuous

684
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:23,359
uh and you're looking at the integral.

685
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,760
you're looking at so you have a function

686
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,640
I don't really think about it as two uh

687
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,520
as two versions

688
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,440
uh but but but uh the the version uh um

689
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,319
but but but I divide it into two

690
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,560
versions here so the function if f is

691
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:46,160
continuous say on the interval from

692
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,960
on this interval here and you define a

693
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,960
function f ofx

694
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,079
which is the integral from a to x of f

695
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,000
of s

696
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,599
ds.

697
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,599
Right? You see for each fixed x in the

698
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,280
interval here,

699
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,319
well, if you're thinking about the

700
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,160
function little f, the little f was

701
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,760
continuous on the whole interval. So

702
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,359
it's continuous on, right? So f here is

703
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,280
continuous on the interval from a to x,

704
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,000
right? So it's when you restrict it,

705
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,000
it's still continuous.

706
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,560
So this means that it's integraable,

707
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,520
right? And so this here gives you a

708
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,079
number, right? And so for each x, you

709
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,000
can think about this number here. So

710
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,520
this gives you a function capital f,

711
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:42,520
right? And the claim is that that this

712
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,520
function here. So the claim

713
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,760
is that the function capital f defined

714
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,280
this way

715
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,280
is is differentiable. So capital f is

716
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,280
differentiable

717
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:05,040
and the derivative of this

718
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:12,640
uh at uh at x

719
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:15,040
um is is uh is little f of x.

720
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,319
And maybe I'll just Yeah. So that's

721
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,319
that's the claim.

722
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,480
Okay,

723
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,480
let's try to prove that.

724
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,599
So let's look at let's try to prove

725
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,319
so we want to prove so we want to prove

726
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,319
that this function so so we want to

727
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,319
prove

728
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,760
to so want to show

729
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,760
uh want to show that

730
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,280
fprime

731
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,280
exist right

732
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,200
uh at say at x0 right if you want to

733
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,880
prove that it exist

734
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,560
then you need to look at the difference

735
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,160
quotient

736
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,160
so we need to look at this difference

737
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,160
quotient

738
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,440
and we need to prove that this thing

739
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,079
here has a limit as x go to x0 right so

740
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,040
x0 is fixed and you want to prove that

741
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,040
it has a limit

742
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:35,599
Let's um

743
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,880
so in order to estimate this let me just

744
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,119
let me not uh divide first let me just

745
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,079
look at what this difference here is

746
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,760
right and then afterwards I'm going to

747
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,480
divide by x - x0 so if I'm looking at

748
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,319
this let's for the sake of arguments

749
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,640
assume that x is bigger than x0 of

750
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,760
course I need to also see when I'm

751
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,480
approaching x0 from the other sides,

752
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,720
right? But but but the argument for that

753
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,359
is similar. So I just assume that x is

754
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,319
bigger than x0.

755
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,599
Well, this difference here, well the

756
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,280
function, so this function here, the

757
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,880
function here, so let me just write it

758
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,119
over here so I have a little more space.

759
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,480
So this difference here where the

760
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:32,640
function this here is the integral from

761
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:37,920
a to x f of s ds and this thing here is

762
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:43,119
the integral from a to x0

763
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:47,680
f of s ds right

764
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:50,560
but this first integral here I can use

765
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,880
this fourth rule that I maybe don't have

766
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,079
anymore. But it the fourth rule is

767
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,079
saying that you can split it up a

768
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,680
integral you can split it up. So here if

769
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,400
you have a you have a then you have x0

770
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,119
and then you have x. If you want to

771
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,839
integrate little f over this it's the

772
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,040
same as integrating over this plus the

773
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,119
integral over that. Right? So I do that.

774
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,960
So this one here I break into two

775
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:24,720
pieces. I integrate from a to x0 f of s

776
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:29,520
ds and then I take the second piece

777
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:33,440
which is from x0 to x

778
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:36,160
and then minus the integral from a to x0

779
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
of f of s ds.

780
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,520
Okay,

781
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,880
but now you see that this one here

782
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,319
cancel out with that, right? And so this

783
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:54,720
difference is just the integral from x0

784
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:57,440
to x f of s ds. Okay.

785
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,839
So

786
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,560
so so

787
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,560
what we have is

788
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,839
we have that this difference here f of x

789
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,200
- f of x0

790
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:22,680
We know that this difference here is

791
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,680
equal to this integral here.

792
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:34,520
Now let me use this to bound this thing

793
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,520
here from above and bound it from below.

794
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:42,160
You see this integral here, this

795
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
function here. So this function here if

796
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,599
you're looking at this integral here

797
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,440
sorry for f of s ds

798
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,440
well this function here is

799
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,319
is smaller

800
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,720
than the max right the function is

801
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:04,000
continuous so max and soup is the same

802
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,720
the max or soup whatever you want on

803
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,400
that interval right so this thing here

804
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:19,040
is less than than the integral of

805
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:23,000
um if you will x0 to x of the soup of f

806
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,000
on this interval here,

807
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,319
right? But this is just a constant,

808
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,359
right? And so this here is just uh this

809
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:36,240
is just like the soup of the function on

810
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:39,119
this little interval

811
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,440
times, right? So this constant. So this

812
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,680
just pops out and then it's just the

813
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,839
integral of one on this. But that's just

814
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,160
the length of the interval. So it's this

815
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:52,079
here times the length of the interval.

816
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:56,000
And the length of the interval is this.

817
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:58,319
Right? So this thing here is less than

818
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,720
that. Right?

819
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:04,800
Likewise this function here on this

820
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:08,800
little interval is bigger equal to the

821
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,200
in. So this is bigger than

822
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,760
right than if you were just integrating

823
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,760
the in of the function on the same

824
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,760
interval.

825
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,880
But the in and is this is just a

826
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:26,319
constant. This pops out. So this thing

827
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:31,480
here is just the in

828
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,480
of the function on this interval here

829
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,119
times the length of the interval.

830
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,119
Okay, like that.

831
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,920
Okay, so now I can and remember that

832
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:49,680
this here was equal to the difference,

833
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,640
right? So now I can just record this. So

834
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,280
what I have is now

835
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,960
What I'm interested in is in the

836
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,079
difference in capital f. So what I'm

837
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,040
interested in is of course I really want

838
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,960
to look at the difference quotient but I

839
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,839
can do this in just a second. So I'm

840
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,599
interested in the difference of the of

841
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:16,559
the function at those two points. Right?

842
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:19,920
I know that that difference is equal to

843
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:23,280
that integral here and that integral is

844
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,920
bounded from above by this and below by

845
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,559
that. So I just write I can now just

846
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,000
write that this difference here maybe I

847
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:35,599
should write it so I have a little more

848
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,319
space somehow f of x minus f of x0

849
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:42,960
the difference is bounded from above by

850
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:45,520
this thing here the soup of f

851
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,400
on this little interval

852
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:52,160
time x - x0

853
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:55,040
and it's bounded from below

854
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,839
by the in

855
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,839
on that same interval

856
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,079
times the length of the interval.

857
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,240
Right?

858
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,559
So now now we can go to the different

859
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,800
function because we just divide by x -

860
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:18,000
x0 on both sides. x is bigger than x0.

861
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,599
So you have this in here. So you have

862
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,720
this difference quotient here. And

863
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,720
that's what we want to show has a limit.

864
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:30,319
And now we have that this is less than

865
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:33,760
soup of f on this little interval here

866
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:38,240
and it's bigger equal to the in

867
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:43,680
of f on that same little interval.

868
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:47,319
Right? But you see that as x here

869
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,319
but now you have

870
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:54,119
[Applause]

871
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,119
now you have that as x go to x0

872
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:08,599
right so

873
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,599
so now as x goes to x0

874
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,160
right the values

875
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,359
and not just the value at x but actually

876
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,559
in this whole interval here the values

877
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:24,079
goes to the what the values is at x0

878
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:27,040
right so you see that this here

879
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,079
this the right hand side here goes to f

880
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:34,559
of x little f ofx0 and the left hand

881
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,480
side go to little of f of x0 right so

882
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,240
this means that this thing is squeezed

883
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,480
between these two numbers that goes to

884
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,040
the same number. So this difference

885
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,440
quotient also goes so this difference

886
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,440
quotient here

887
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,920
goes to

888
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,280
f of x0 right because it's squeeze

889
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,880
between those two numbers that converge

890
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,520
to the same number namely to f ofx

891
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,640
little f of x0.

892
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,880
So this here proves

893
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,920
that it's but technically speaking I

894
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:16,960
only did it where I'm assuming that x

895
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:19,359
was bigger than x0 if you if you let so

896
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,280
you also need to check when x is

897
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:25,040
strictly less than x0 and it's

898
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,520
converging to x0 from below

899
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:31,599
but with trivial modification the same

900
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:34,640
proof works so and and and that's done

901
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,359
out in the notes so I to not go through

902
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,640
that.

903
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,599
Okay. Now let's talk about so this is a

904
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:47,160
second version of the fundamental

905
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,160
theorem of calculus

906
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:57,200
right and so I mean again you know you

907
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,880
wouldn't really eventually kind of think

908
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,079
about it as probably as two different

909
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,559
versions but but but there sort of

910
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,359
slightly you know it's it's two two

911
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:10,240
things about the same stuff

912
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,319
but uh second version here. So I divided

913
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,200
into these two versions. So the second

914
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:19,640
version. So

915
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,640
so again fundamental thermal calculus

916
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,160
version two.

917
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:37,280
And so this is the following

918
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:40,880
that you take a function uh f that is

919
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:45,359
def you know and is f is defined on some

920
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:50,480
interval from a to b

921
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:53,280
into r and f is differentiable.

922
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:57,200
So this here exist

923
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:03,119
it's differentiable at each point

924
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:06,599
and uh and um uh f here this little f is

925
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,599
reman integral

926
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:19,520
and then the claim is that um

927
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:20,480
that f of b minus capital f at a is the

928
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:28,400
integral

929
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:33,720
from a to b of uh of little f of x dx.

930
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,720
Okay, so that's a claim, right?

931
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Um,

932
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,559
all right. I wonder if I should just

933
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,240
skip that.

934
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:50,640
Uh I did that I did the proof uh for for

935
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,599
this out in the notes also. So maybe

936
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,599
I'll just skip that.

937
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,599
Um

938
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:02,000
and and then

939
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,160
uh

940
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,920
okay so now but let me look at an

941
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,920
example where I'm applying it.

942
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Um

943
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:29,359
and so I have uh I'm looking at so

944
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:30,880
suppose I want to compute x² from 0 to 1

945
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:34,720
dx

946
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,520
suppose I want to compute that

947
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,400
and so in this case I could look at So

948
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,319
if I sort of want to apply that version,

949
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:48,400
I could think about suppose I'm looking

950
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:51,680
at f ofx equal to uh x ^ 3 over three,

951
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,559
right? Suppose I'm looking at this.

952
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:58,559
Well, if I'm looking at this function, I

953
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:01,520
know that capital f of x is equal to the

954
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:05,520
derivative of this is just x²,

955
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:07,440
right? So this say and x squ is now of

956
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,960
course it's continuous so it's

957
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,880
integraable right so this means that uh

958
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,880
by the second by the by this second

959
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,880
version

960
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,119
uh of the fundamental thermal calculus

961
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:42,319
Then we have that uh that f of 1 minus f

962
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:46,799
of zero

963
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:48,640
is equal to the integral right of of the

964
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:53,520
derivative because the derivative is

965
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:58,640
integral. So 0 to 1 of of

966
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,319
x² dx, right? But this here is now just

967
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:04,480
evaluating

968
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:08,480
this function here. So this here is/3

969
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:13,079
minus zero. So this original integral is

970
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,079
a third, right?

971
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:20,799
Okay. So,

972
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,160
so the next thing um right so the next

973
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:28,960
thing I want to talk about is

974
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:31,280
uh uh improper integrals. Okay. So this

975
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,280
here concludes this here was stuff I

976
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,960
actually had from the previous lecture.

977
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:39,040
That was why I skipped a couple of

978
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:42,160
things. But but um

979
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,040
um but yeah, but the details uh for for

980
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,040
the things I skipped is in the notes and

981
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:51,720
the things I skipped is very similar to

982
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,720
things I went through here anyway.

983
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,400
Okay. So now let me look at improper

984
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,599
integrals. And there's a couple of

985
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,240
versions of this. So we will look at two

986
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:07,599
version of this. one is where the

987
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:11,880
integral where the integral is. So we

988
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,880
look at so improper integrals.

989
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,960
So I'm going to look at two versions. So

990
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,960
two versions.

991
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:37,000
uh version one is where the integral is

992
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,000
unbounded. The integral

993
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,559
is unbounded

994
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,640
and the second version is where the

995
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,640
function is unbounded.

996
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:04,640
Okay. Now in the first version

997
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:06,559
then you take uh you uh looking at a

998
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,720
function

999
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:12,799
uh f

1000
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:16,520
and this function is uh integral. So f

1001
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,520
here is integral

1002
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:25,480
uh from a to b

1003
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,480
uh for all

1004
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:33,760
uh so so a here is fixed

1005
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:39,280
but it's integral for all uh b bigger

1006
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:43,119
than a so a is fixed so a here fixed

1007
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:47,520
and it's integral like that Okay. Then

1008
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,119
what we want to what we are interested

1009
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,119
in

1010
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,880
so again if you're thinking about the

1011
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:58,799
integral as a kind of think about the

1012
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:01,599
integral as the weighted area.

1013
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:04,880
So and weight just means that if the

1014
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:07,200
function is negative in a stretch then

1015
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,960
the area there will count with a minus

1016
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,680
sign. Right? So uh this here is so what

1017
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,200
we're interested in is we're interested

1018
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,720
in

1019
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:22,400
making sense of the area the weighted

1020
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:25,680
area below the graph where we go all the

1021
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:30,280
way out to infinity. Okay. And so this

1022
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,280
is you know does this make sense?

1023
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,359
So this is this is in this case the

1024
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,400
improper integral. It's improper because

1025
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:50,240
it's not a bounded integral. Right? And

1026
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:56,160
so yes, if yes if uh this limit here

1027
01:01:50,240 --> 01:02:00,319
of um a to b if this limit here of f of

1028
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:03,960
x dx if this limit here is b goes to

1029
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,960
infinity exist

1030
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,160
then we say

1031
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,839
we say

1032
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:17,440
that the improper integral here from a

1033
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:19,839
to infinity of f ofx.

1034
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,720
We say that this here exists and is

1035
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,720
equal to this limit.

1036
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:36,240
Okay.

1037
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,520
So this is one version of the improper

1038
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,359
integrals and the other version is uh

1039
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:46,040
the other version of the improper

1040
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:46,040
integral is the following

1041
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,960
um

1042
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:59,240
um so the second version.

1043
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,240
So this is where f here is unbounded.

1044
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,880
In a minute I'll look at examples of

1045
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,400
both things. So the function is

1046
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:14,960
unbounded. So it's defined on but f here

1047
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:18,640
is supposed to be integral on say a to b

1048
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,319
right sorry a uh supposed to be integral

1049
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,280
from

1050
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:26,480
um it's supposed to be integral from c

1051
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:30,359
to b

1052
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,359
uh for all

1053
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:37,119
c

1054
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:41,680
bigger than so see See here C is bigger

1055
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:44,400
than some A and less than B. So think

1056
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,799
here about

1057
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,119
here you have A

1058
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,960
here you have B. So A and B in this case

1059
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,720
are fixed

1060
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:58,000
but the function is not bounded. It's

1061
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:01,920
not maybe even defined at A. Right? It's

1062
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:06,480
not really defined at a but it is but if

1063
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:10,240
you but it is integral on if you go

1064
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:15,559
anywhere strictly to the right of a then

1065
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,559
it is integral on this interval here.

1066
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:24,720
And so if if this limit so if

1067
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:28,720
this limit here as c goes to a the

1068
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:33,559
integral from c to b of fx

1069
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,559
dx if this limit here exists

1070
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:42,319
then we say that this improper integral

1071
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:44,880
from c to b sorry a to b of f ofx dx

1072
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,559
this is a improper integral because the

1073
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,160
function is not bounded on this whole

1074
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:53,200
interval. It's not even defined at at at

1075
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:58,400
a. If this here we say that this thing

1076
01:04:53,200 --> 01:05:02,319
here is equal to this limit as c = to a

1077
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:05,599
of c b f ofx

1078
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:09,119
dx. Okay.

1079
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:12,480
And so you know you the improper

1080
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,000
integral actually often appear in

1081
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,720
things.

1082
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,559
Okay. So let me look at examples of

1083
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,960
this.

1084
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,720
So I will look at example of this and I

1085
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:26,720
will look so again there's these two

1086
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:29,440
versions where the integer is unbounded

1087
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,119
or the function is unbounded. Right? Of

1088
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,839
course there's all kind of variation of

1089
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:37,920
this. Right here I looked at where the

1090
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:40,319
function was unbounded to the left or

1091
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,520
you could do the same to the right. It

1092
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:45,039
could be this interval here. this

1093
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,240
interval

1094
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:51,599
in the in the uh the where the interval

1095
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:55,280
was unbounded you I'm talking I was the

1096
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:59,280
ex when I I explained what it means I

1097
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:02,000
did it as if the interval was unbounded

1098
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,720
to the right but of course you can also

1099
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,160
look at unbounded to the left or you

1100
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,319
could even look at where it was

1101
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,039
unbounded both to the right and to the

1102
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,039
left Okay,

1103
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:20,760
but let me look at some examples.

1104
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Um

1105
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:33,119
and so the first example

1106
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,400
again the first two examples would be

1107
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:39,640
where the interval is

1108
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,640
uh unbounded.

1109
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:54,079
So the first example here

1110
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:56,960
is uh where the interval is unbounded

1111
01:06:54,079 --> 01:07:00,240
and we're looking at uh the interval is

1112
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,280
1 to infinity and we're looking at the

1113
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,520
function uh f ofx

1114
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,520
= 1 /x²

1115
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,520
right

1116
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,200
and I'm interested in.

1117
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:18,240
And the question is, does

1118
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:25,799
the improper integral

1119
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:25,799
this here of 1 /x^2 dx does this exist?

1120
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:34,000
That's a question, right?

1121
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:37,119
And so you we use the fundamental

1122
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,760
theorem of calculus to determine that.

1123
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,920
We observe that if you're looking at f

1124
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,240
ofx

1125
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,119
which is 1 /x

1126
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:50,400
then the derivative here

1127
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,640
is uh of this function here this is 1

1128
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,720
/x²

1129
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,359
okay

1130
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:01,039
so this is what we observe so therefore

1131
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:05,760
it means that if you integrating from 1

1132
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:10,000
to b of 1 /x^2 dx

1133
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:12,799
this thing here is the same as f of b

1134
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,319
minus f of one.

1135
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:18,159
Right?

1136
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:22,400
And so using this and we know what f is

1137
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:29,679
you have that this is minus

1138
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:31,839
uh minus sorry 1 over b and uh no sorry

1139
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:34,239
yeah it's minus one over b. This is what

1140
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:39,440
you get from this. And here you're

1141
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:42,719
getting one plus one like this, right?

1142
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,799
And so you see that this thing here as B

1143
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,880
goes to infinity this here converts to

1144
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:52,799
zero. So this converts to one. So indeed

1145
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:56,640
this improper yes

1146
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:59,359
is our answer and and what it is equal

1147
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:03,040
to.

1148
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:05,279
Why? because it converts to one,

1149
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,839
it's equal to one.

1150
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,520
Okay, so again, if you're thinking about

1151
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:12,319
it, it's sort of a little bit like what

1152
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,279
we did for series that you're summing

1153
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:17,279
infinitely many numbers. So here you're

1154
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:20,480
looking at something and you're looking

1155
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,319
at the area, but the area actually is

1156
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,640
finite even though it continue on

1157
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,480
forever.

1158
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,040
Um

1159
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:33,520
h so that's one version of it. Suppose

1160
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:38,000
that instead of 1 / x^2. So one over the

1161
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:41,199
property that the function 1 /x^2 has is

1162
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,520
that it go really quite fast to zero. As

1163
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:49,440
x go to infinity 1 /x^2 goes really

1164
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:52,640
pretty fast to zero. Suppose I look at a

1165
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:55,360
function that does go to zero. But if it

1166
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,960
doesn't go to zero, right? If the

1167
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,280
function doesn't go to zero, right? And

1168
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:01,920
if we were kind of let's say that it's

1169
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,679
was staying above a certain line well

1170
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,679
then the area below the graph would of

1171
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,679
course be larger than this thing and

1172
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:10,880
that would be infinite. So it's not

1173
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:14,560
going to converge right? So so it will

1174
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:18,480
have to kind of go to zero in some way.

1175
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,960
Um so example two I'm looking at another

1176
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,280
function still goes to zero again the

1177
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,560
interval is the same from one to

1178
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:29,120
infinity and the function is now this

1179
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,120
time it's one of x

1180
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:34,320
still goes to zero so maybe it has a

1181
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:38,480
chance let's let's see

1182
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:45,920
if you now take the integral from one to

1183
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:47,840
x of uh 1 to b sorry of uh of 1 /x dx x.

1184
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,920
Well, again, you use the fundamental

1185
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:54,800
therm of calculus. If you're looking at

1186
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,280
the function f of x = to log of x, the

1187
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,320
derivative of log

1188
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:03,040
is 1 /x.

1189
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:05,040
Right? So, this thing here by the

1190
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,560
fundamental theorem of calculus, this

1191
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:11,520
second version of fundamental the

1192
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:17,760
calculus is f of b minus f of one.

1193
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:21,360
And that is log of B minus log of 1. Log

1194
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:24,239
of 1 is zero. So this is just log of B.

1195
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:27,120
But as B goes to infinity, this here

1196
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:29,760
actually goes, it's not bounded. It tend

1197
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,880
to wander off to infinity. Right? So

1198
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,880
this improper integral here, this one

1199
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,880
here

1200
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:42,239
does not exist.

1201
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:45,440
Right?

1202
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:47,440
It actually it's like the area below

1203
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,199
this function here would actually be

1204
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:53,760
like infinite. Right?

1205
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,520
It does not go to zero fast enough.

1206
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,560
Okay?

1207
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,320
So that's examples of the where the

1208
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:04,960
interval is unbounded. Suppose that we

1209
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,360
look at examples where the instead of

1210
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,679
the interval is being unbounded the

1211
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:14,440
function is unbounded.

1212
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,440
So let's look at some example of that

1213
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,320
suppose you take so now

1214
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:28,320
suppose you take the interval from so

1215
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:31,760
the interval is bounded but the function

1216
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,920
is not bounded

1217
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,960
is sorry the function the interval is

1218
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:41,840
bounded but the function is unbounded so

1219
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:45,840
I'm looking at first f ofx X = 1 /<unk>

1220
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:49,199
of X as X go to zero

1221
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,960
square root of 0 X goes to to zero so

1222
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:54,480
this means that one over it goes to

1223
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,880
infinity so this function is not bounded

1224
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,040
but if I'm now looking at so I want to

1225
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,719
look at the improper integral where I'm

1226
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:05,199
taking this function the function is

1227
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,960
blowing up as I'm going close to zero

1228
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:13,440
right blowing up like that and I want to

1229
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:17,120
I want to see does this here does uh

1230
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:20,679
this improper integral here

1231
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,679
does this exist

1232
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,719
right that's a question

1233
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:32,159
uh and so in order to figure that out I

1234
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:37,040
use the fundamental theorem of calculus

1235
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:41,280
again so if I take the function

1236
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:45,199
if I take the function function uh f(x)

1237
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:50,280
= 2 *<unk> x

1238
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:50,280
and I now take the derivative of this

1239
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,120
then I get 1 /<unk> of x

1240
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:05,320
and so this means that um so this means

1241
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,320
that if you now look at Um

1242
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,920
so this means that if you're now looking

1243
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:21,840
at the integral here

1244
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:26,320
uh of um

1245
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:32,480
uh right this integral from a say to one

1246
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:39,360
of 1 /<unk> x a strictly positive dx X.

1247
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:44,480
This thing here is capital F of 1 minus

1248
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:48,159
capital F of A. And so capital F was was

1249
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,760
this function here. So this is two I

1250
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:53,520
two<unk>

1251
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:58,159
one that's one. So it's two minus

1252
01:14:53,520 --> 01:15:00,800
uh 2 square<unk> of a. But now as a goes

1253
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:04,080
to zero this here converts to two.

1254
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,400
Right? So this improper integral exists.

1255
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,400
So yes,

1256
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,800
this one here exist

1257
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,120
and is equal to two.

1258
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:25,679
Okay,

1259
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:29,159
let's look at one uh one last example

1260
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,159
uh of this

1261
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,600
um

1262
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:53,920
And so this is another example where the

1263
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:57,040
function is so again you know uh in in

1264
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:00,640
in this sort of example the function was

1265
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:03,040
unbounded. It's blowing up.

1266
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,719
It's going to infinity but the area

1267
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,040
below the graph that's what we

1268
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,920
calculated is still actually finite.

1269
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:12,880
Right? But what if the function is

1270
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:16,159
blowing up faster than this? Right? So

1271
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:19,920
this is an example like this. that if

1272
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:22,960
you take uh this it's again the interval

1273
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:27,199
from 0 to one and the function is now

1274
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:31,440
now it's going to infinite faster as x

1275
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:34,480
goes to zero. So this is the function

1276
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,600
and so now we want to we again asking is

1277
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:43,280
does this does the improper integral so

1278
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:46,280
does this improper integral here

1279
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,280
exist

1280
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:53,199
and uh let's see if it exist or not. So

1281
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,840
we use the fundamental theorem of

1282
01:16:53,199 --> 01:17:00,080
calculus again we observe that the

1283
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:03,280
function f ofx equal to log of x that

1284
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:07,520
the derivative of this function is just

1285
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:11,920
1 /x. So this means that if we integrate

1286
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:14,560
from a a is now again strictly positive

1287
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,159
strictly positive.

1288
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,159
So if you're looking at this integral

1289
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,159
here,

1290
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,320
this here is because of the second

1291
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:29,120
version of fundamental theore calculus.

1292
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:32,920
We have that this here is f in one minus

1293
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,920
uh f and a.

1294
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:39,280
And this thing is now log of one that's

1295
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:44,159
zero

1296
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:47,920
minus log of a. Uh log of a is uh right.

1297
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:50,159
So log of a so it's like that.

1298
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,800
And now remember that log the log

1299
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:54,800
function here the log function looks

1300
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:58,400
like this

1301
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:01,440
right this is the log function.

1302
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:05,199
So you see that as as you go towards

1303
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:07,840
zero here this number here goes to minus

1304
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:12,320
infinity so this here goes to infinity

1305
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:16,280
right so it doesn't converge right so uh

1306
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,280
so the answer is no

1307
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:24,400
okay

1308
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:26,960
and so the very last thing uh I want to

1309
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:32,440
talk about is just I'll just give you a

1310
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:32,440
definition. So this is arc length.

1311
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:40,840
So uh suppose you take a curve

1312
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,840
in the plane.

1313
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:51,400
So suppose that I have a curve in the

1314
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,400
plane.

1315
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:03,280
So gamma of t

1316
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:06,000
this is a curve so it has in the plane

1317
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,239
so it means that it has two coordinates

1318
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,480
is called gamma of s I think that's what

1319
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:12,320
I did in the notes

1320
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,000
uh

1321
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:21,679
so this here is the curve

1322
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:24,679
and uh and I'm assuming that f and g are

1323
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,679
differentiable

1324
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:33,239
and the derivative here

1325
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,239
are continuous.

1326
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:39,840
So suppose I have such a curve and s

1327
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,600
here is running in an interval from a to

1328
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,960
b.

1329
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:49,120
Then the length of the curve is by

1330
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:54,239
definition the integral from a to b of

1331
01:19:49,120 --> 01:20:03,280
square root of uh f prime

1332
01:19:54,239 --> 01:20:06,960
of s squared plus g prime of s squar

1333
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:08,400
d s. So this is this is the length of

1334
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,600
the curve. Maybe I'll talk a little bit

1335
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:15,199
more about that next time.

1336
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:19,280
Okay. So, I'll stop here. So, and I'll

1337
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:22,320
post the the notes. Uh,

1338
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:25,320
any questions?

1339
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,320
Okay.
