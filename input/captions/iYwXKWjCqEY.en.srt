1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,960
Um I'm Ellie Nadivi. I'm a professor of

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,599
brain and cognitive sciences and I have

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,279
an appointment in biology too. And um

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,960
what I'm interested in is the brain's

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,760
ability to constantly adapt um what we

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,080
term as plasticity.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,119
And it's a fundamental feature of the

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,679
brain to be able to

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,960
uh constantly change

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,879
um as need arises.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,760
And uh even though we study it because

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:46,800
it's such a important aspect of brain

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,160
function, uh it turns out that uh when

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,760
things go wrong many

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,480
um of the things related to plasticity

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,879
um are the culprits.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,399
And uh the other thing is that if we are

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,879
thinking about damage or any sort of uh

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,640
uh degenerative processes

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:12,320
or even um um disorders that are

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,360
genetic, uh if we know more about how

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,360
the brain itself can um adapt, we know

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,240
what the points are where we can

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,920
intervene to help.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
Um

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,600
so I think that even though we work on

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,520
questions that are really basic science

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,320
uh it turns out that there's a lot of

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:40,479
interface with uh potential therapeutics

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,320
um even uh sort of predictive

31
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:48,240
um assays. I actually am excited about

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,960
all the projects in the lab. Uh so there

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,200
are kind of two directions that we have

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,759
in terms of even though our overarching

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,320
question is related to brain plasticity.

36
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,439
One is um using imaging as a tool to

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,920
look at how connections are made in the

38
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,800
brain in real time where we can label uh

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,400
neurons or brain cells and the

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
connections between them which are

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,040
synapses and we can monitor them coming

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
and going over time and things that

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
influence that. So that's an incredibly

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,720
powerful tool to um to look at

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,080
plasticity in the living mouse brain

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,760
which uh we're doing. And so

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,239
um

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,280
um and many

49
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,760
very basic features of how that happens

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,800
have sort of revealed themselves to us

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,280
through just being able to visualize the

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,959
connectivity and how it and track it

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,760
over time.

54
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,160
Um so because of that all the projects

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:59,760
using the imaging as a tool um I think

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:03,040
are super exciting and uh um and kind of

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,879
discovery projects um which is why I

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,280
love them because we keep finding new

59
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,000
things some of which we weren't really

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,680
looking for or weren't expecting

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,239
um and have been um

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,239
have allowed allowed us to really gain

63
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,040
mechanistic insight even though what

64
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,920
we're doing is just observing.

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,720
Um so that's kind of one direction that

66
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,920
I think is super interesting.

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,159
So um there are different types of

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,319
neurons in the brain and there are

69
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,879
different types of connections between

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,959
cells that are of different types and um

71
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,080
what we're seeing is that not all

72
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,799
connections are created equal. There are

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,040
some connections uh that are very rigid

74
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,879
and nonflexible

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,000
um sort of hardwired you might say. And

76
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,920
on the other hand, there are some

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
connections that are very plastic and

78
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,200
dynamic.

79
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,400
And so it seems that not all parts of

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,120
the circuit are equally amendable to

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,640
plasticity. And um and this is something

82
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,439
that we're seeing for the first time

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,400
because we can actually track um

84
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,479
dynamics over time and look at the

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,479
connectivity and see how it's changing

86
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,759
and who it's changing and uh kind of the

87
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,800
specific specificity of those types of

88
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,639
changes. So that's kind of in general

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,919
one thing that we've been able to see

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,840
that um there's a lot more heterogeneity

91
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,600
and obviously if you're interested in

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,199
plasticity

93
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,120
uh your ability to intervene depends on

94
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,600
your knowing

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,400
um what parts of the circuit are

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
amenable to change and that's where

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,240
you're more likely to be able to make a

98
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,240
difference.
