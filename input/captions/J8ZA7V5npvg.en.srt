Hi, my name is Alexis Marcus. I'm part

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,920
of the admissions team here at MIT

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,920
Sloan.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,880
So, is there a certain type of candidate

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,920
that Sloan's looking for within the MBA

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,240
program? Short answer is no. One of the

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
greatest things about the MIT Sloan MBA

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,400
program is the diversity of thought and

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,720
perspectives amongst our students.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,240
There's no cookie cutter Sloan student.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,160
And the great thing is that people are

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,599
coming from all sorts of undergraduate

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,680
majors as well as prembba industries.

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
Our program is designed for anyone who's

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,239
looking to advance in their field or

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,239
pivot in their careers.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
Well, our application's open and we're

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,120
really excited to meet you. So, please

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,120

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,120
rounds.
