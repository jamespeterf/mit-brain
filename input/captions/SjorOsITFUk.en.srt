00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,840
Good evening everybody and welcome to

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,679
tonight's Broad Discovery Series event.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm Tom Olrich and I'm the associate

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,359
director for science communications here

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,840
at the Broad Institute. It's my pleasure

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
to welcome everybody in in the room and

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
everybody online who's joining us this

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,519
evening. For those of us who are joining

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,599
us for the first time, the Broad

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,679
Discovery series explores the genetic

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,480
and biological roots of human health and

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
disease, the mechanisms that govern how

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,320
our cells and bodies function, new

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
technologies that are changing what's

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
possible in science, and new advances

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,680
that could be translated into treatments

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
for common and rare diseases. It's my

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
pleasure to introduce our speaker for

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,920
tonight, Shomo Raichodri.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
Shomo is an institute member here at the

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,520
broad director of the center for data

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,039
sciences and the JS Coblin MB Brener

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
distinguished chair in rheumatology and

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
immunology at Brighamin Women's Hospital

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
a professor of medicine and of

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,960
biomedical informatics at Harvard

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
Medical School and he also is a clinical

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,119
rheatologist.

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
Shomo's lab studies the genetic risk

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,560
factors and mechanisms that underly

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,799
arthritis. And tonight he's going to

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
talk about how that research is

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
revealing a lot about how the immune

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
system and the genome as a whole work

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,000
basically.

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
This evening also marks the 2025

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,640
Elelliana Hector Memorial Lecture

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,640
presented in memory of Elelliana and

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,320
with the support of the Elelliana Hector

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,520
Memorial Fund. Aliana was a gifted MDPhD

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,280
student and a member of the Broad

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
community. And I'd like to take a moment

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
to thank her family and friends and

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
loved ones who are watching us this

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,560
evening.

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,920
If you have any questions for Shomo, I

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
encourage you to flag down one of our

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
micr runners during the Q&A portion of

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,240
the evening. And if you're watching

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
online, uh, please drop your questions

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
into YouTube chat. I'll do my best to

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
work them into the conversation as the

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
evening goes on.

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
If you're a Brody or a scientist with a

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,000
deep technical question for Shomo, I

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,640
encourage you to approach him after the

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Q&A or during the reception uh so that

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
members of the community have an

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
opportunity to ask their questions. And

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
speaking of the reception, I invite

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
everybody here in the room to join us in

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
the Broad Discovery Center right out

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,040
here outside the auditorium after

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,680
tonight's talk uh for a short reception.

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
And I also encourage you to explore the

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,260
uh museum's exhibits and interactive

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:36,400
elements. Shomo, take it away.

69
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:39,200
[Applause]

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay. Um, thank you everyone for uh sort

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
of joining me uh after after your busy

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,599
days. Um, so um today I'm going to talk

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
about uh autoimmunity in in general and

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,680
the specific manifestation of

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,080
autoimmunity which is uh uh immune

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,519
arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. And

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
uh I'm going to be presenting that from

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
the perspective of someone who thinks a

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,159
lot about the genome and how the genome

80
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,440
works. Um so um the immune system I

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
think for most of us when we think about

82
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,800
the immune system we think about B cells

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,159
and T- cells um and and we and and it's

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
true that those are very important

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,159
components of the immune system but the

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
immune system is actually uh broader

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,440
than that. It's a system of cells,

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,680
tissues,

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,519
organs and processes that protect um

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
that protect us against external and

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,239
internal threats uh that lead to

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,920
disease. Um and and typically its most

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
important role is is obviously protect

94
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,840
us from pathogens such as viruses and

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,680
bacteria. Uh but it also protects us uh

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
well sort of protects us from foreign

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
tissues. For example, we get a

98
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,319
transplant um or damaged tissues. For

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
example, when we develop mutations that

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,159
lead to cancer, uh the immune system

101
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,280
works to prevent that. Um uh and it

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,120
involves a whole range of of organs uh

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,840
including the organs that house T- cell

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,760
to B cells such as tonsils and legones.

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Uh but it also involves other organs

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
that you don't normally think of as

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,799
imunologicals. for example, the skin uh

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,959
or the gut wall which protect you from

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
um the the bacteria and the other

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,880
pathogens that live you know on the

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:20,720
other side of of of us.

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,000
Um we are becoming increasingly aware of

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
the important role that the immune

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
system plays in so many different

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
diseases. Um infectious diseases again

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,040
uh is something we think about most most

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,960
commonly in terms of the immune system.

118
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,120
autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,240
which is going to be a focus uh in this

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,400
talk. Uh we've over the last 10 years

121
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,919
realized important role of immune system

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,160
in preventing and treating cancer. Um

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
and uh and now there's emerging data of

124
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,400
the role of immune system in

125
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,240
neuroscychiatric and

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
neurodedevelopmental diseases in

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,919
metabolic diseases and cardiac diseases

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,680
uh and the list goes on. Um in many

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,320
instances the immune system is not the

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,199
major player uh in in all of these

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,080
conditions. Uh sometimes it's a it's a

132
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,400
secondary role uh but immune system is

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,479
very targetable through therapeutics. So

134
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,360
sometimes the role it plays is exactly

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,039
the role that we can uh go after uh with

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,800
the drugs that are being developed.

137
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,639
Um so um they're really a sort of a

138
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
dichotomy to the immune system when we

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,479
think about it. Um they're they're two

140
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
uh separate components and obviously

141
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,840
there's some overlap but the exchange

142
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,240
are the innate immune system and the ad

143
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,120
that domain immune system um the innate

144
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,720
system is the part of the immune system

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,120
that's non-specific. So when you first

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,240
get an infection um it's the part that

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,120
responds. It doesn't really uh remember

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,759
uh and doesn't really have memory um in

149
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,320
in the sort of typical sense of memory.

150
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
um and it acts quickly and broadly. Um

151
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
and it's sort of your first line of

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,919
defense and it includes things like

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,000
barriers. Um the adaptive immune system

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,000
uh is a little bit more specific. Uh

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,280
when you get a particular infection or

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
still pathogen that you experience or

157
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,720
encounter, it's the adaptive immune

158
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,919
system that learns it, protects you from

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
it. It's the part of the immune system

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,360
that we activate when we get a vaccine.

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,280
Um and it acts more slowly than the

162
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,440
innate immune system but acts with more

163
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,000
precision and protects you from when

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,840
that threat occurs again.

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
Um and again a lot of the times if you

166
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,000
think about these uh components of the

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,639
immune system in terms of the cell types

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
that that are the muscle behind them for

169
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,000
the innate immune cells there's cells

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,160
like uh the neutrfil the eosinaphil the

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,800
macage and for the adaptive immune

172
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
system uh they're the T- cells the B

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,560
cells the positive cells the cells that

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,360
make the antibodies um the B cells um

175
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,960
and those those play the part role um

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
and uh and as we think about

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,400
autoimmunity is really the adaptive

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
immune system that we're going to be

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
focusing on. Um, so I'm going to make a

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
subtle uh distinction between

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,880
autoimmunity and autoinflammatory

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
diseases. So autoimmune diseases are

183
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,319
diseases when your immune system attacks

184
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,080
an organ because it mistakes it as a a

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,000
threat. Um, and then there's there's a

186
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
wide range of autoimmune diseases where

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
the immune system is going after a

188
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,479
particular multiple organs and that

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,479
really um is your adaptive immune system

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,800
gone wrong. The auto-in-flammatory

191
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,800
diseases are the ones where your um your

192
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
innate immune system is is

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
malfunctioning. Um a lot of those

194
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
diseases have a systemic component uh

195
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,880
can be accompanied with systemic

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,560
inflammation or or chronic inflammation.

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
And the reality is most of the diseases

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
that we call autoimmune or

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,759
auto-inflammatory uh really live

200
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,919
somewhere on a continuum.

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,599
Um so the autoimmune diseases is where

202
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,720
where I'm going to be uh focusing on

203
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,560
today. Um these are um diseases that can

204
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
really affect every organ system. Some

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,280
of them are very specific. For example,

206
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,520
thyroiditis affects the thyroid organ.

207
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
Uh ulcerative colitis is a disease where

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,479
your immune system is attacking very

209
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
specifically the the the colon. Um and

210
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,319
then there are other uh conditions that

211
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,360
are more non-specific such as systemic

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,440
lupus or systemic vasculitis where the

213
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,199
immune system is really uh attacking

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,199
multiple organs uh all at the same time.

215
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,759
um these conditions are are individually

216
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,479
rare. So if you think of a condition

217
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,560
like systemic lupus or or type 1

218
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,800
diabetes, they affect one in a thousand

219
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
or three in a thousand individuals. Uh

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
some of these conditions are a little

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,120
more common such as psoriasis which is a

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,959
imunological disease of the skin which

223
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,279
affects about three in a 100 uh

224
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,120
individuals. Uh but if you put it all

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,120
together about one in 20 individuals

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,399
have some type of autoimmune disease. So

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,959
they're um in aggregate um uh in

228
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,360
aggregate more common uh than than we

229
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,360
think of them as.

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
Uh the disease I'm going to spend a lot

231
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,160
of my time on and I've spent a lot of my

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
career on is rheumatoid arthritis. Um

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,640
rheumatoid arthritis uh is a condition u

234
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,000
that's kind of a relatively new disease.

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
I mean it was really described for the

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,440
first time in 1800 and that was when a

237
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,399
medical student uh in France in the year

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
8 of the French Republic um or the year

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,560
1800 by our calendar uh recognized a

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,240
condition uh that he called athena gout.

241
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,120
Uh he basically looked at nine

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,120
individuals um and understood that these

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,880
individuals had a a type of gout that

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,800
was different from the typical gout. It

245
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,720
affected women predominantly. It had a

246
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
chronic core, so it wasn't sort of

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,279
coming and going the way gout typically

248
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,880
does. Um, and it affect multiple joints

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,519
um all at the same time. It was

250
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,200
polyarticular.

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,360
Um, today we know that rheumatoid

252
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,000
arthritis is a disease that affects uh

253
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,959
about one in a 100 individuals. Uh, it

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,959
leads to systemic destruction uh of of

255
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,000
the joints and the hands and many other

256
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,120
uh joints. Um uh and there's a

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
particular tissue that's really

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,320
important in the synovium called the uh

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,399
or in rheumatoid arthritis called the

260
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,160
synovium. So you see this uh thin

261
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
membrane that surrounds the healthy

262
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,760
joint. When people have rheumatoid

263
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,680
arthritis, that joint becomes inflamed

264
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,560
and engorged um with uh immune cells um

265
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,120
and that uh engorged tissue then works

266
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,760
into the joint and solely destroys it.

267
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,839
um uh the disease can lead to systemic

268
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,880
uh complications um such as lung

269
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:25,760
involvement um uh and and and it can

270
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:29,279
affect uh other other organs uh as well.

271
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,959
Um so before um I go further into this,

272
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,720
I'm going to present how I thought about

273
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
the immune system u maybe when I was

274
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,279
like a medical student. Um, and I think

275
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
I think maybe a lot of us uh, well,

276
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,040
maybe I won't speak for anybody else

277
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
besides myself. Uh, but but when I first

278
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,640
thought about the immune system, I sort

279
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,720
of thought of it as something you either

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
have more of or less of, right? That

281
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,680
there's uh, individuals in the middle

282
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,600
who are immunompetent. Um, and either

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,200
because you're on a problematic drug or

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
or your immune system is somehow

285
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,519
compromised, you might move to the left

286
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,760
and be imunompromised and and therefore

287
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,880
you might get an infection. Uh or you

288
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,120
might be uh someone who has an overly

289
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,279
active immune system. Um in which case

290
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,880
you have um an autoimmune or

291
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,959
auto-inflammatory disease and what you

292
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,600
really want to do is somehow um get to

293
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,160
the middle. Um

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,160
uh this view that I had was really uh uh

295
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,560
challenged uh when I was a young medical

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,279
student uh before I knew I would do

297
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,399
anything with uh immunological diseases.

298
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,279
Uh when I had an attending doctor uh

299
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,000
called Hal Holman. Hal died last year.

300
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,279
Um Hal is um and again when he was my

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
attending I'm not sure I appreciated

302
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,320
this about him but he was really one of

303
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,880
the founders of of the field of of

304
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,160
immunology and he kept talking about

305
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,079
autoimmune diseases as uh a condition

306
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
where one thing can blend into another

307
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,480
or that there can be different

308
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,079
components to it. Um, and I really

309
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,920
didn't know what he was talking about

310
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,920
um, until I came to understand that he

311
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,920
was the person who originally uh,

312
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,000
described a a condition called mixed

313
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
connective tissue disease. Um, and this

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,399
was a particular imunological condition

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,040
where you could have one of or multiple

316
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,040
of many uh, manifestations such as

317
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,279
arthritis, uh, myasitis um, renal

318
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,440
disease uh, and and you can see the long

319
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
long list here. Um, and every patient

320
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,639
can look a little bit different. Um, and

321
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,959
I think that's a kind of general

322
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,120
principle of of autoimmunity. Um, that

323
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,720
it's not just really one flavor. It's a

324
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,079
lot of components that can fit together

325
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,399
in complicated ways. Um uh Hal was also

326
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,160
a remarkable guy in that uh his career

327
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,320
at different points was derailed by his

328
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,360
political activities including uh uh

329
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,160
being blacklisted by um uh by the

330
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,560
McCarthyists and and and uh losing his

331
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,760
job as as the chair of Stanford uh

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,279
medicine uh because uh of his protest of

333
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,680
the Vietnam War. So he was a very

334
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,399
influential guy in a lot of ways to

335
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,000
those of us in the medical community.

336
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
Um

337
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,079
uh so autoimmunity um is very difficult

338
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,000
to diagnose uh and also to treat. Um uh

339
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,959
as I mentioned uh many of our patients

340
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,720
have multiple autoimmune um symptoms uh

341
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,959
and they don't neatly fit into these

342
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,839
categories that I told you about uh in

343
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,839
the beginning. Um another thing that's

344
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,680
uh uh interesting about autoimmunity is

345
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,519
that in the last couple decades we have

346
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,079
a large armamentarium of different

347
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,760
therapeutics. we obviously need more uh

348
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,200
but it can take us years to find the

349
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
right treatment for the right patient

350
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,279
and a lot of times uh we don't know if

351
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,160
we have our patient on the best possible

352
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,959
therapy um and uh and there's some

353
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,560
consequences to that um because as we

354
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,639
search for the right therapy our

355
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,720
patients are facing in the case of

356
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
arthritis joint damage or damage to

357
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
their uh other organs they can have

358
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,800
reduced quality of life um and uh for a

359
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,120
lot of our patients they end up being

360
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
managed on steroids which can work but

361
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,720
have a lot of other complications

362
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,240
associated with them, including an

363
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,320
increased risk of of of heart disease.

364
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,760
Um, so I thought I would just uh tell

365
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,240
you about a few uh few quick cases uh uh

366
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,120
a couple of my my patients. Um, so this

367
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,079
is a a woman that I met about 7 years

368
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,639
ago. She was 59 at the time. Uh, when I

369
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,480
saw her, she had complained that her

370
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,000
hands were stiff and swollen, which is

371
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,079
typical of of inflammatory arthritis. Um

372
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,760
she had taken medications like ibuprofen

373
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,519
which helped a little bit but not that

374
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,040
much. Uh and she had a family history of

375
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
rheumatoid arthritis. And on the on the

376
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,800
right here you see her hand and you can

377
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,000
imagine how painful that thumb uh thumb

378
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,360
must have been. Uh we did some tests um

379
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
and her tests were actually were

380
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,199
actually negative for rheumatoid

381
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,959
arthritis uh but positive for lupus. But

382
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,279
despite that we treated her for

383
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,800
rheumatoid arthritis because that's um

384
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
that's what her clinical picture looked

385
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,000
like. a disease that mostly affected the

386
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,279
hands um and mostly affected uh her her

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,600
other joints to a lesser extent. Um

388
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,480
so uh this is uh sort of uh her five her

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,000
next five years uh with me. Um and

390
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,320
without getting into all the details,

391
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,959
she basically went uh on eight different

392
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
treatments in a fiveyear span. Um and

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,040
and since this slide, she's continued to

394
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
cycle through other treatments and each

395
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,040
one works to some extent but doesn't get

396
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,880
her all the way better. And again, this

397
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
is the one of the challenges of our

398
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,959
patients that were sometimes struggling

399
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,279
to find the right drug for them.

400
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,320
Um, this is another patient. Um, this is

401
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,040
a uh 34 year old woman that I met about,

402
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
um, 13 years ago. Uh, she originally

403
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,399
presented with a certain amount of

404
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,199
stiffness in the morning. Uh, she had

405
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,760
presented to her primary care doctor for

406
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,880
tendinitis. She had had some episodes of

407
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,040
sort of a flare of of her tendons. uh

408
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,440
she was managed uh with prennazone to

409
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
get her wrists uh better. Um so when I

410
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,079
saw her I saw that her skin was

411
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,480
involved. She had psoriasis in her skin.

412
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,720
Um her she tested positive for lupus and

413
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,560
tested positive for inflammation. Uh but

414
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
I treated her for seriatic arthritis

415
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,399
because I thought likely uh it was

416
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,920
likely the case that the disease of her

417
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,560
skin and the disease of her joints went

418
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,240
together. So the same imunological

419
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
derangement that was causing her skin to

420
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,880
be involved was also causing her joints

421
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,600
to be involved. Um

422
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,240
uh so um for the next 10 years this is

423
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,680
what happened. Um we started her on

424
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,920
prennazone and got her off. We put her

425
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,519
on an anti-inflammatory something like

426
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,240
ibuprofen a little bit stronger called

427
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,920
nebumatone. Um she tried to stop taking

428
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,480
it a few times but flared. So um so she

429
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,720
was persuaded to get back on it. Um and

430
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,720
and then after a while even though she

431
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,839
was uh on that medication she started

432
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,519
developing uh more swelling um in her

433
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
shoulder and her pinky. So we started a

434
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,079
stronger medication called laflunamide.

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,759
Um in 2020 her mom became my patient

436
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,839
because her mom also had the same

437
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,600
condition. Uh diseases like this can

438
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,040
sometimes be familial. Um and in 2022

439
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,800
she went to the emergency room because

440
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,360
she had some shortness of breath and and

441
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,120
some uh chest pain. They were worried

442
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,279
about a pulmonary ambism and they did

443
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,399
this CT scan on her and you can see here

444
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,680
that there's some things that you

445
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,400
shouldn't have in your lungs. She has

446
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,000
these big masses over here. Um and um

447
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,760
and initially the thought was that this

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,199
might be some kind of uh some kind of

449
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,039
malignancy. Um the clue was um the first

450
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,480
clue that uh it was something else was

451
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,199
when we looked at our inflammation

452
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
markers. Um you can see in 2019 they

453
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
weren't that high. they were in the in

454
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
sort of the 10 to 20 range, a little bit

455
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
higher than normal. And as we went

456
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
through time, you can see that that

457
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,360
inflammation level really climbing up

458
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,440
high on her. And so after after doing a

459
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,520
lung biopsy, what we came to realize is

460
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
that she actually had those masses

461
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,840
weren't a malignant mass, but they were

462
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,679
an inflammatory mass. She had a

463
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,080
condition called sarcoidosis, which is a

464
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
type of infiltrating inflammation. We

465
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,520
treated her initially with prennazone

466
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,760
and then we put her on another very

467
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,120
targeted drug called infleximab and

468
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,640
right now she's doing fine. Um but but

469
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,400
there's also this question of how long

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,000
will this drug work for her? Is it the

471
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,160
right drug? Um so a lot of these um u a

472
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,640
lot of these choices that we make to

473
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,440
keep our patients well are a little bit

474
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,360
um um arbitrary and based on experience

475
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,760
and based on clinical data but not

476
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,080
really as based on the science as as as

477
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,200
we would ideally like.

478
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Um so so I so I would say actually the

479
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,360
um uh the our view of the immune system

480
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
my view of the immune system is that

481
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,280
it's much more complicated than a simple

482
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,520
you know you don't have enough or you

483
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,520
have too much because it can manifest

484
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,080
itself in lots of complic complex ways

485
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,320
causing complex symptoms um and um and

486
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
and we and the immune system probably

487
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
has many dimensions. It's not a simple

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,120
spectrum. it's probably highly

489
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,039
multifaceted with many different

490
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,960
components and each component itself can

491
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,960
be disregulated leading to different

492
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
disease manifestations. So if you go

493
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
back to this uh picture of all these

494
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
different cells, you can appreciate that

495
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
each of these cells themselves are one

496
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,520
of those components. And then if you

497
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,000
take a particular cell like like say the

498
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,200
T- cells and you zoom in, what you see

499
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,160
is that when you uh take a T- cell and

500
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,960
look at the spectrum of tea cells um uh

501
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,360
even those tea cells are not a monolith.

502
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
Uh there's rather multiple functional

503
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,600
categories each playing a different role

504
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,679
in the immune system. some of which are

505
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,600
honing in on specific antigens and and

506
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,080
going after it and coordinating the

507
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,919
immune system to attack others which are

508
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
actually more regulatory in nature

509
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,039
trying to trying to keep the other parts

510
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,640
of the immune system in check so you

511
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,919
don't have too much of a a reaction and

512
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,000
we'll come back to the regulatory tea

513
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,640
cells later on

514
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,400
um and um that complexity is actually

515
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,120
something we can exploit so uh we um so

516
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,120
there's a an upside to this complexity

517
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
uh which is that we can develop drugs to

518
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,880
go after these different components So

519
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,160
um for example, if you think a dis

520
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
disease or a particular type of

521
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,840
inflammation is being driven by B cells,

522
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,080
well maybe you should use a medication

523
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,919
like ocrolusamab which is used in

524
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,640
multiple sclerosis also used in lupus

525
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,240
because it deletes B cells. Um if you

526
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,520
want to do something about TE- cells

527
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
because you think the inflammation is T-

528
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,600
cell driven, you might use Abotaccept

529
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,440
which which blocks uh T- cell

530
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,880
activation. Or if you want to enhance

531
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,640
TE- cells because you're trying to

532
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,039
trying to fight a malignancy, you might

533
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,080
use Prolysmab which activates TE- cells

534
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,840
so that you're killing uh your tumor. Um

535
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
and and sometimes what you want to do is

536
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,200
block the way particular immune cells

537
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
are communicating with each other. In

538
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,280
that case, you want to really go after

539
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,120
cytoines uh and block uh those cytoines

540
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,919
which serve as the uh messages between

541
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,760
cells. So anti6 which I'll come back to

542
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,159
later on or toolsimab blocks that cell

543
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,480
cell communication.

544
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,919
Um so um a lot of the uh goals that I

545
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
have or the goals we have in the lab is

546
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
to try to define the modifiable

547
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,039
components of the immune system. Um and

548
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,360
the strategy that we've taken is is

549
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,240
first to really focus on human data. Um

550
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
there's a lot of animal models of of uh

551
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,760
uh immune diseases which have been very

552
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,080
useful over many decades as we've

553
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,000
developed different different drugs but

554
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,280
um but people are are different from

555
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,600
mice in some ways some small ways um and

556
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,440
uh and so trying to find the things that

557
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
really work for humans and human disease

558
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,760
is is very important to us. Um the

559
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
second is uh is what you might call

560
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,320
human immunology which is to really

561
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
define the key uh uh tissue cell

562
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,440
populations really find those cell

563
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
populations those immune cell

564
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,919
populations that are active in inflamed

565
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,360
tissue and try to try to modulate them.

566
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
And then the third thing is to focus on

567
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,400
causal biology. uh we focus on genetics

568
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,840
because it's inherited and the genetic

569
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,799
differences in different people that

570
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,640
predispose you to a particular disease

571
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,480
have to be causal because you're born

572
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,600
with them and you have those changes

573
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,880
long before you have the disease.

574
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,960
Um so um so so this is the idea so that

575
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,799
you know on the left we're we're uh

576
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,760
looking at genetics to define causal

577
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,760
biology in humans. uh on the right we're

578
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,360
using human immunology to define the

579
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,360
essential compon components of tissue

580
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,960
inflammation. And the idea is if we can

581
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,200
find that causal biology that's working

582
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,880
in a specific cellular context or tissue

583
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,039
context, then we can really develop

584
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
tissue specific or cell type specific

585
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,720
therapies that are both effective for

586
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,159
inflammation but also safe because

587
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,240
you're not just turning the whole immune

588
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,520
system down or turning the whole immune

589
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
system up in case you're trying to

590
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,520
trying to activate it.

591
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,960
Um so um so I'm going to start uh this

592
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,679
next part of the talk by really focusing

593
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,679
on tissue and tissue inflammation. Um so

594
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,840
as I mentioned uh I had a cartoon of

595
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,360
this before for rheumatoid arthritis

596
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,440
what we really pay attention to is the

597
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,520
synovium. It's this thin membrane that

598
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,919
surrounds the joint. Uh and you can see

599
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,320
it uh not so well on the left because

600
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,159
that's a healthy knee. Um so it's it's a

601
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,679
barely visible membrane. On the right

602
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
you can see the synovium. It's all that

603
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,880
red stuff. So that small membrane has

604
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,640
now become inflamed uh and is really uh

605
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,320
really digging into the joint and

606
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,559
causing problems. Um so one strategy

607
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
that you might think would be you know

608
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,080
useful is to really try to understand

609
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,840
what those cell states are in that

610
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,200
inflamed synovium. Maybe if we

611
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
understood what those cell types are,

612
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,400
what those cell states are, those would

613
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,360
be places that we could target for

614
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,440
therapeutic uh therapeutic benefit. Um

615
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,480
so um the the work I'm going to describe

616
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,080
is uh is is really um a project I've had

617
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,919
the pleasure of being a part of but is a

618
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,720
large um um uh you know national even

619
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,320
international uh consortium of of of

620
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,240
many different institutions and many

621
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,840
different individuals. Um and it's

622
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,760
called the AMP RA Lupus Network. It's um

623
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,400
driven by the NIH and and by private

624
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,919
funders as well. Um and I just want to

625
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
acknowledge some of the key people uh

626
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,120
fan Helena Parnia who who led a lot of

627
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,200
the analyses uh that I'm about to show.

628
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,400
Um so this project uh was conceived um

629
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,799
you know sort of uh around 2017 2018 and

630
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
at this time what was happening was that

631
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,720
single cell technologies were really

632
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,400
taking off. Um so it was now becoming

633
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,400
possible uh to uh look at individual

634
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
cells and measure all the genes and how

635
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
active they were in individual cells.

636
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,080
And as you can see that technology was

637
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,280
really looking at like you know one to

638
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,000
10 cells uh a decade earlier and now we

639
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,039
were able to look at 10,000 100,000

640
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,760
cells all in one go. Um and so we wanted

641
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,720
to apply that to rheumatoid arthritis.

642
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,240
Um and um this is some of the data that

643
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,880
came out of that study. So uh we assayed

644
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,559
uh inflammatory tissues inflammatory

645
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,760
synovium from rheumatoid arthritis

646
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,440
patients uh to get a data set of 300,000

647
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,320
cells and what you see here are the

648
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,320
major cell types. So no surprise it's

649
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,880
inflamed tissue. So you see B cells, T-

650
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
cells, myoid cells and K cells. But you

651
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
also see some of the tissue cells, the

652
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,039
endothelial cells and the fibroblasts

653
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,159
which are also interacting with immune

654
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,720
uh cells uh to to kind of propagate uh

655
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,720
propagate inflammation.

656
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,799
So um one of the first things that we

657
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,440
saw uh which was a little bit surprising

658
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,640
to us because um all of these patients

659
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,080
had the same disease. They all had

660
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,919
rheumatoid arthritis. But when we

661
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,559
started looking at their inflammation

662
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,400
and simply asking how many T- cells are

663
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,400
we seeing in a given sample? How many B

664
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
cells are we seeing in a given sample?

665
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
We started to see that there's some

666
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,120
individuals that have a lot of myoid

667
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,640
cells, a lot of macrofasages. There are

668
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,000
other individuals that have a lot of T-

669
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
cells and B cells. Those are in the

670
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,799
middle. very creatively we call them T

671
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,720
plusB. Um some of them have a lot of T-

672
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,279
cells and fiberblast we call them T plus

673
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,960
F. Um so we actually found six different

674
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,039
groups um of of patients. Um so this was

675
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,039
a lot more heterogeneity in terms of

676
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,360
tissue inflammation than we expected to

677
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,720
see. Um so this exercise and cell

678
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,159
counting is really interesting. But what

679
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,919
what about if you just like look at the

680
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,159
tissue? Do you see the differences that

681
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,919
we see when we count cells when you

682
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,240
actually look at the at the biopsy

683
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,799
samples? Um, and here we're looking at a

684
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,480
at a simple H& pathology slide. At the

685
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,600
top you're looking at the F individuals,

686
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,279
those individuals that have a lot of

687
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,200
fibroblasts. At the bottom, you're

688
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,799
looking at the TB individuals, those

689
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,760
individuals that have lots of T and B

690
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
cells. And these are just two

691
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
representative samples. And right away,

692
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,039
you see that these two things don't look

693
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,559
the same. The bottom has a lot of

694
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
purple. That indicates a lot of

695
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,240
cellularity relative to what we see in

696
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,600
the top.

697
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,080
Looking a little bit deeper, we can

698
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,520
stain them for uh for T- cells and B

699
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,080
cells. So you see the bottom really

700
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,960
lighting up with T- cells and B cells uh

701
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,880
with the light blue indicating T- cells,

702
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,320
the purple indicating the B cells. And

703
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,679
you can see sort of clusters of those

704
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,039
immune cells uh uh occurring together.

705
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,120
So it's not just that you have a lot of

706
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,000
these cells, but they live in the tissue

707
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,080
in a very particular way.

708
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,279
If you stain for fibroblasts, you also

709
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
see something interesting. So if you

710
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,799
look at the individuals that have a lot

711
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,159
of fibroblasts, they don't just have any

712
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,840
kind of fibroblast. They have a lot of

713
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,200
these click five positive fibroblast.

714
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,080
And you see where they are. They're

715
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,600
surrounding um they're surrounding uh

716
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,120
the tissue. So these are what we call

717
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,039
the lining fiberblast. So it's a very

718
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,960
particular kind of fibroblast that these

719
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,480
individuals have. So again pointing to

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,880
this kind of interesting hetrogenity

721
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,640
that we have in these samples. So our

722
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
first thought was like you know maybe

723
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,760
what we're seeing is people with more

724
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,159
active disease, people with less active

725
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,279
disease, maybe the people who have the

726
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,679
fibroblast rich uh RA, maybe they just

727
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,520
have less active disease. and the people

728
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,440
that have lots of T- cells and B cells

729
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,279
maybe have more active disease. That's

730
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,559
not actually what we saw when we looked

731
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,640
at these samples and we looked at their

732
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,240
disease activity of of the individual

733
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
patients. We saw that they were all

734
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,400
actually pretty active. Um so the

735
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,679
differences in the tissue uh didn't just

736
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,279
go with how um how affected or how

737
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,400
active an individual patient was.

738
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,000
But are there implications for

739
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,159
treatment? Uh that's also a really

740
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,240
important question. uh and we worked

741
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,320
with uh with some of our colleagues in

742
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,720
the UK. We looked at some clinical trial

743
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,559
data uh and they had samples that were

744
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,720
treated with multiple imunom modulatory

745
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,600
drugs. One that went after B cells, one

746
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,919
that went after uh anti-IL6. They had

747
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,440
133 patients. And we were able to take

748
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,440
their patients and figure out which of

749
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,320
these categories their tissue would fit

750
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,679
into. And what we saw is that the

751
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,159
likelihood that you'd respond to

752
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,720
treatment did have something to do with

753
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,799
what type of inflammation uh your tissue

754
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,120
had. Specifically, we saw that the

755
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,600
individuals who had a lot of fibroblasts

756
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,520
um they were less likely to respond. And

757
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,159
this isn't a surprise because that

758
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,000
fibroblast proliferating um tissue

759
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
inflammation, that's not the kind of

760
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,840
thing that our drugs go after. Our drugs

761
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,320
go after B cells and T- cells. Um, so

762
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,399
this is a a a category of patient that

763
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,200
maybe we're not treating uh as well as

764
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,000
we should.

765
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,240
Um, so now we can look at each of those

766
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,399
six major cell types, the T- cells, NK

767
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,919
cells, fibroblast or stomal cells, and

768
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,840
we can look at the hetrogenity within

769
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,799
them. And what we see is that within

770
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,039
each of these populations, there's a a

771
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,720
wealth of heterogeneity. Um, so I'm

772
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,159
going to look at T- cells because u

773
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,799
that's one of the most important cell

774
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,880
types for us in the world of u uh

775
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,000
autoimmune diseases. Uh, and what we see

776
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,120
here is that there's uh, uh, 24 uh

777
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,240
different um, uh, T- cell types. You

778
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,080
might see that the number only goes up

779
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,480
to 23. That's because in our lab we

780
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,360
start counting from zero. Um, it's a

781
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,760
computer science kind of thing. Um, so

782
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,840
um, uh, so really a lot of interesting

783
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,960
hetrogenity. And one of the questions we

784
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,480
wanted to ask is are the T- cells that

785
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,320
we see in people that have a lot of T-

786
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,000
cells and fibroblast different from the

787
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,760
T- cells that we see in individuals that

788
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,360
have T- cells and B cells or different

789
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,279
from the people that we see that have T-

790
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,360
cells and myoid cells. Are they all the

791
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,720
same TE- cells or are there differences?

792
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,880
Um, and it turns out that these six

793
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,399
flavors of inflammation not only have

794
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,600
different amounts of TE- cells, but they

795
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
also have different kinds of T- cells.

796
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,520
So the people who have lots of T- cells

797
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,440
and B cells um you can see that they

798
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,840
have a particular kind of T- cell which

799
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,679
is these T3 T7 T peripheral helper

800
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,200
cells. For the people who have T- cells

801
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,480
and fibroblast they have they don't have

802
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
an enrichment for those kinds of T-

803
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,200
cells. They have other T- cells that are

804
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,399
enriched. Um so um so it's not enough

805
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,159
just to know that someone has a lot of

806
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,039
T- cells but also the type of T- cell

807
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,640
they have can can vary. Um and those T-

808
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,240
cells up in the upper left corner are

809
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
really interesting to us. We spent a lot

810
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,159
of time thinking about them. uh those

811
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,440
te- cells uh as you can see have a lot

812
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,039
of expression of IL6 receptor or IL6R.

813
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,320
Um, so these are the individuals. These

814
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,200
are the cells that we're sort of going

815
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,360
after when we use toolsab that anti-6

816
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,960
drug I told you about. We think of it as

817
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,399
something that disrupts communication in

818
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,440
the immune system. But actually what

819
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,039
you're doing is you're disrupting

820
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
communication with a particular type of

821
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,120
tea cell. So that drug is actually a lot

822
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,240
more specific than we maybe give it

823
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,000
credit for. What about fibroblasts? Um,

824
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,840
so these are not cells that we normally

825
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,840
think of as immune cells. They they make

826
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,159
up the sort of structure of of the

827
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,480
tissue. Um and what we see is that

828
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,880
there's multiple uh fibroblast uh

829
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,320
population. So there's the F uh type of

830
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,919
inflammation with lots of fibroblast,

831
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,919
but there's some people with a lot of T-

832
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,159
cells and fibroblast, other people with

833
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,159
endothelial cells, fibroblast and myoid

834
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,520
cells. Are they all the same? Uh and

835
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,440
again, we can do the same kind of

836
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,559
analysis. And what you see is that these

837
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,600
F-1 populations are really enriched in

838
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,520
the individuals that have the uh the

839
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,200
most fiberblast. So people who have the

840
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,559
most fiberblast in their inflammatory

841
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,240
tissue, they don't just have a lot of

842
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,000
fibroblast. They have a specific

843
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,120
enrichment for this particular type of

844
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,640
fiberblast called the lining

845
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
fibiberblast. So just tuck that away

846
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
because I'll come back to that in a in a

847
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,559
few minutes.

848
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,880
Um so so hopefully I've convinced you

849
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,640
that tissue inflammation in RA and

850
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,679
probably in other diseases isn't

851
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,919
homogeneous. It's rather heteroggeneous.

852
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,000
uh uh we looked at cell populations in

853
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,440
RA senovial inflammation in this case

854
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,720
and we found that different patients

855
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
have different types of cell type

856
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,640
heterogeneity um and that hetrogenity

857
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,559
may have something to do with treatment

858
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,039
response and different cell states track

859
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,480
with different inflammatory subtypes and

860
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,159
there's some potential there because

861
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,919
that might mean that different drugs may

862
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,559
be most effective against specific

863
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,919
cellular uh subtypes and maybe certain

864
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,519
patients would do better with certain

865
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,760
kinds of drugs than other kinds of

866
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,760
patients.

867
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Um, so now I'm going to switch gears and

868
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,600
and talk about the genetics. Uh, up

869
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,760
until now I've been talking about uh

870
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,840
tissue immunity. Uh, but uh but but it's

871
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,919
hard to know when you look at inflamed

872
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,279
tissue what's causing the inflammation

873
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,200
and what's responding to the

874
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,399
inflammation. The genetics maybe hopes

875
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,679
to help us untangle that.

876
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,919
Most of the time when we talk about

877
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,000
genetics um casually we're talking about

878
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,000
mandelian genetics. So so these are

879
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,679
diseases that kind of run in the family.

880
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,080
So uh you know you can imagine your

881
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,039
typical mandelian disease um is one

882
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,519
where uh your one of your parents uh has

883
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,519
the gene and uh a child inherits it and

884
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,679
they maybe have the disease as well.

885
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,600
That's a a dominant uh genetic disease.

886
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,240
So these are kind of familial uh

887
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,320
genetics which are highly predictive. um

888
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,200
uh rheumatoid arthritis, most autoimmune

889
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,600
diseases and most complex diseases are

890
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,159
complex uh genetic diseases which

891
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,000
involve hundreds of thousands of uh of

892
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
different genes and often have a pretty

893
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,640
large environmental component. Um each

894
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,000
gene or mutation makes a tiny uh plays a

895
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,720
tiny role uh in disease risk. Um and the

896
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,360
genetics is only somewhat predictive um

897
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,919
of of disease.

898
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,600
Uh one of the key metrics we use is uh

899
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:17,039
is sibling risk. So we ask um you know

900
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,919
if if a if your sibling has a the

901
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,080
disease what's your relative increase in

902
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,600
risk. So for disease like rheumatoid

903
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,600
arthritis which is present in about one

904
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,519
in a 100 individuals if you have an

905
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,760
affected sibling your risk goes up to

906
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,480
about four in 100. So we would say the

907
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,880
this metric this lambda s is about four.

908
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,120
Um and you can see that uh for all of

909
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,279
these diseases there's an increased risk

910
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,360
if you have a first-degree relative or a

911
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,799
sibling that has this uh condition

912
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,200
suggesting that there is some kind of

913
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,720
genetic basis to it. It's not 100 or a

914
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,480
thousand. That's what we would see with

915
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,000
a more familial uh genetic disease.

916
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,840
Um we've been working on the genetics of

917
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,519
rheumatoid arthritis for like a really

918
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,320
long time. We've been uh been doing this

919
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:02,000
for about 20 years now. um and uh in

920
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,480
that time we found 150 different um risk

921
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,399
alals or 150 different uh risk lossi.

922
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,200
These are regions of the genome that are

923
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,760
driving uh risk of rheumatoid arthritis.

924
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,440
Um it's really a global effort. Um our

925
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,399
lab is has been lucky to be a part of

926
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,800
it. Um but as you can see uh in our our

927
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,879
latest study uh which we published in

928
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,960
2022 um we uh had uh global

929
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,119
representation uh capturing five

930
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,320
different major ancestries. Study had

931
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,720
about 40,000 cases and 240,000 controls

932
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,919
uh that we analyzed.

933
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,159
Um and I won't talk too much about the

934
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,079
HLA locus. The HLA locus is a critical

935
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,520
component of the machinery that displays

936
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,119
antigens to tea cells. Um and if you if

937
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,200
you look at the whole genome and um here

938
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,599
each spot represents an individual snip

939
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,079
or genetic marker uh what you see is

940
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,000
there's this like massive tower um in

941
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
chromosome 6 and that's the HLA region.

942
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,040
So it's a really important player in

943
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,640
rheumatoid arthritis risk. Um and uh we

944
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,720
had fine mapped the signal to an

945
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,560
individual spot in an individual protein

946
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,560
which we think is really important for

947
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,720
how the immune system recognizes

948
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,760
antigens h and how it interacts with te-

949
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,960
cells to activate them.

950
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm going to spend most of the time

951
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,359
today talking about the other LOSI. Um

952
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,760
so um for all those other 149 uh LOSI in

953
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,480
the genome only about 10% of them are

954
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,720
what we call coding alals. These are uh

955
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,599
changes in the DNA that actually change

956
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,680
the protein. Uh 90% of them are outside

957
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,160
of genes. And we think they work by

958
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,920
altering how uh the gene is controlled

959
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,440
and how the gene is regul the genes are

960
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,839
regulated. Um most of these uh changes

961
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,400
are changes in individual base pairs. Uh

962
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,880
it's a single uh uh change in a single

963
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,160
spot in the genome. Um and what we've

964
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,160
noticed is that these snips are very

965
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,960
often close to genes. Many of these

966
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,839
genes are important for T- cell biology.

967
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Um and they they very often sit in

968
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,320
regions called regulatory regions that

969
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,200
control uh the function of those of

970
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,720
those genes.

971
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,440
Um

972
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,040
now um one of the reasons uh one of the

973
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,400
things that we think a lot about is that

974
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,680
these snips are really hard to

975
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,160
interpret. They're really hard to make

976
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,839
sense of for a couple reasons. One, if

977
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,480
you find a given snip that's associated

978
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,640
with disease, it's not by itself driving

979
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
the risk necessarily because there's a

980
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,000
whole bunch of snips nearby that are all

981
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,240
correlated with it that are inherited

982
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,200
together in a block. So it's very

983
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,880
difficult to know whether the the single

984
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
variant that we're reporting on is the

985
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,400
driver or if it's a marker for some

986
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,079
other signal that's nearby. Um

987
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,560
the snips are often as I mentioned in

988
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,240
regulatory DNA. So they tweak expression

989
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,920
of a nearby gene and they influence how

990
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,680
genes work. So trying to understand

991
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,359
those regulatory mechanisms have been a

992
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,800
really important focus of our our lab's

993
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,960
work. Um and some of the snips turn the

994
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,520
uh activity on uh activity up for a

995
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,200
gene. Some of them turn it down. Um, but

996
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,720
one of the other uh things that we think

997
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,040
a lot about is some of these snips

998
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,280
matter in very specific cells or cell

999
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,119
states. Um, and we often don't know what

1000
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,640
the right cell type or cell state is.

1001
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,880
And so we spend a lot of time trying to

1002
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,480
figure that out.

1003
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,800
Um, so for um any given locus um uh we

1004
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,400
need to define what the driving snip is.

1005
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
And as you can see this is this is kind

1006
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,640
of a typical region and each of these

1007
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,560
points represents a a genetic change or

1008
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,079
or a snip. And you can see there's a

1009
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,079
whole row of red uh uh changes there.

1010
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,680
Whole row of red snips. Those are all

1011
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,200
correlated with each other. So you can't

1012
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,760
just simply look at that and know which

1013
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,200
one is the one driving disease. Um so

1014
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,560
it's really important for us to think

1015
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,079
about the downstream gene, to think

1016
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,839
about the downstream functional effect,

1017
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,079
and to think about the cell state that

1018
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,440
it matters the most in. Um and all of

1019
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,800
these problems are interlin with each

1020
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,000
other. So it's a little bit like a like

1021
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,240
a Jenga uh puzzle where uh you know if

1022
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,920
you don't solve all of them in some

1023
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,240
sense at the same time the whole thing

1024
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,560
can fall apart. So so that's um yeah so

1025
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,119
that's that's my life. Um so so um so we

1026
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,800
take uh two uh overarching uh

1027
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,079
approaches. Um one is a statistical

1028
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,760
approach and then the other is a

1029
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,599
functional experimental approach. And on

1030
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,680
the statistical side, we're analyzing

1031
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,520
human data from patients from healthy

1032
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,640
individuals to look at how these genetic

1033
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,800
changes uh affect uh the activity of a

1034
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,640
gene or an activity of some kind of

1035
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,560
molecular fingerprint. On the right

1036
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,280
side, we're interrogating cells trying

1037
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,960
to change the DNA to see what happens to

1038
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,240
figure out what the functional effect of

1039
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,440
an individual genetic changes.

1040
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,480
Um so I'll walk you through u one

1041
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,040
example. Um so uh this is a a

1042
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,640
statistical computational technique uh

1043
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,880
in this case. So what we're doing is

1044
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,720
we're fine mapping a locus. Um this

1045
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,880
particular locus is called um DNA1L3. So

1046
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,480
we see this particular snip uh that was

1047
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,480
flagged in a large genetic study. And

1048
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,400
when we dug into it, what we saw is that

1049
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,040
that snip actually fell right in the

1050
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,359
middle of this gene called DNA1 L3. It

1051
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,280
actually stopped the function of the of

1052
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,000
the protein. It actually was a

1053
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,560
disruptive mutation. it changes the an

1054
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,520
arginine to a cysteine in that protein.

1055
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,480
Um and and so we uh felt very confident

1056
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,240
that this is the causal uh causal gene.

1057
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,320
Um now when you go back and look at that

1058
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,640
single cell data I told you about what

1059
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,079
you see is that this gene is very

1060
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,920
specifically expressed in lining

1061
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,880
fibroblasts. Um so not only is this gene

1062
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,440
important in in uh causing RA, it's

1063
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,280
important in the right context uh which

1064
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,640
is a very particular fiberblast

1065
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,480
population um that that we sometimes see

1066
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,240
expanded in some of our patients with

1067
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,920
tissue inflammation. And you can imagine

1068
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,000
if you wanted to target this particular

1069
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,240
gene, you would want to do it in those

1070
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,920
individuals maybe who had the most

1071
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,599
amount of these lining fibroblasts

1072
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,480
because because that's that's where the

1073
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,480
action is. Um and this is what I showed

1074
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,280
you before. Uh this is that same

1075
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,079
population that's expanded in our CTAPF

1076
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,560
individuals. Uh but most ch losi are

1077
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,119
more challenging. So uh most of them 90%

1078
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,400
of them are uh non-coding change. They

1079
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,960
don't change the protein but they

1080
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,320
control how the protein is regulated. Um

1081
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,280
and so we need to really think about

1082
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,920
regulatory elements um and and how they

1083
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,440
work and in which cell states they work.

1084
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,160
Um so um so here we use expression

1085
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,480
quantitative trait lossi or eqls and we

1086
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,680
use let gene expression be our guide. Um

1087
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,160
and so so if a snip is regulatory maybe

1088
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,480
you would think that that uh snip is

1089
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,079
sitting there in a promoter or enhancer.

1090
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,079
You can see here I have an a to change

1091
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,000
and that's disrupting how a

1092
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,240
transcription factor or the regulatory

1093
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,079
machinery interacts with the DNA and

1094
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,760
maybe that has an effect on gene

1095
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,800
expression.

1096
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,040
Um and for for for example for a

1097
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,280
particular snip this is an RA snip uh

1098
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,000
which is near the BLK gene. You can see

1099
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,280
that as you have as your uh genotype

1100
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,440
goes from GG to GC to CC the expression

1101
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,599
of this particular gene BLK is

1102
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,440
negatively affected and maybe that's the

1103
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,119
mechanism for how individuals with two C

1104
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,200
alles get a little bit closer to having

1105
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,640
an autoimmune disease.

1106
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,880
And as I mentioned the challenge for

1107
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,040
this is that this regulatory machinery

1108
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,960
may change from cell to cell from cell

1109
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
state to cell state. So finding the

1110
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,280
right context is really important to

1111
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,920
understand how these snips are are are

1112
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,280
working. Um and again as I mentioned for

1113
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,040
te- cells there's this complexity um and

1114
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,440
as I showed you when we look in synovial

1115
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,760
tissue um it's a very rich complexity

1116
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,079
with all of those 24 uh different cell

1117
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,680
states.

1118
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,599
We've been really interested in using

1119
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,359
statistical and computational methods to

1120
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,599
understand this kind of complexity. And

1121
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,200
here's a here's an example of a

1122
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,839
particular snip uh that we've been

1123
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,680
interested in. It's an RA risk alil. And

1124
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,319
when we looked at single cell T- cell

1125
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,400
data, we see that this snip doesn't have

1126
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,880
much of an effect uh on gene expression

1127
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,920
in the blue cells. Um so you can see in

1128
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,440
the in the lower left, you know, if you

1129
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,200
uh depending on which snip you have, you

1130
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
have only a small change in gene

1131
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,359
expression. But in other cell states, uh

1132
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,280
the red ones, you can see that the snip

1133
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,800
is really affecting gene expression. So

1134
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,520
again, you would think that this snip is

1135
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,280
modulating risk in these particular uh

1136
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,119
cell states. Um and in fact, if you look

1137
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,720
at all of the variants that alter gene

1138
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,119
regulation in T- cells, and here we're

1139
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,319
looking at about 6,000 of them, not all

1140
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,359
of these are are disease alles. Uh but

1141
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,760
what we find uh is that uh many of these

1142
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,280
snips about a third of them 2,000 out of

1143
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,440
6,000 um have cell state specific

1144
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,839
effects. Um so they're doing different

1145
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,920
things in different uh cell states. So

1146
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,480
the therapeutic implication is that if

1147
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,480
the goal is to target these genes, then

1148
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,400
it may be particularly effective to

1149
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,319
target the right cell type and the right

1150
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,000
cell context and maybe in the right

1151
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,839
patient.

1152
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,200
Um so um so now I'll talk a little bit

1153
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,839
about the functional uh some of the

1154
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,599
functional approaches that we take. Um

1155
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,240
so one of the things we've been really

1156
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,400
interested in is trying to um you know

1157
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,560
after we've prioritized causal variation

1158
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,240
with these uh tools after we think we

1159
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,520
have the snip that that we think is

1160
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,560
driving disease we want to really

1161
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,240
confirm it. Um and uh and we think it's

1162
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,920
really important to functionally confirm

1163
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,640
the molecular effect of these disease

1164
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,359
alals. Um and and the approach we take

1165
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,880
is is this gene editing approach. Um, so

1166
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,440
the idea is that you have a snip, it's

1167
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,280
sitting in the DNA. Uh, maybe that snip

1168
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,359
is having an effect on a downstream

1169
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,240
gene. We really want to prove it. Um, so

1170
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,640
what we might do is do gene editing to

1171
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,880
change uh to change the identity of that

1172
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,119
DNA in this case from an A to a T. And

1173
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,800
then maybe what we'll see is that the

1174
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,160
expression of a downstream gene

1175
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,560
increases and then we understand what

1176
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,240
the molecular effect of that DNA change

1177
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,520
is.

1178
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
Now in practice, it's a lot more

1179
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,359
complicated than that. When we try to

1180
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,119
edit cells, we're not always successful.

1181
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,200
We edit a minority of the cells that we

1182
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,280
try to try to go after, particularly for

1183
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,280
immune cells. So, you might be looking

1184
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,119
at a population of cells, and you might

1185
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,680
only be successfully editing one of

1186
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,119
these uh in the middle. Um, so we

1187
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,200
developed a method called Minecraft

1188
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,359
Seek. Um, uh, when we tried to publish

1189
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,960
it, uh, some of the, uh, the journal

1190
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,920
told us that there's apparently a video

1191
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,839
game, uh, called Minecraft. So uh so

1192
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,960
they asked us to change the name uh so

1193
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,960
that we don't detract from the

1194
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,880
popularity of the video game. Um so what

1195
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,040
we do here is we take our cells, we try

1196
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,640
to edit them, some of them get edited

1197
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,400
successfully, some of them don't. And

1198
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,560
then what we do is we sort those cells

1199
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,760
into a into a plate and then we assay

1200
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,000
every individual cell. Um and when we do

1201
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,040
this, we are looking at the DNA of the

1202
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,960
cells to see if we've changed um uh

1203
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,560
changed the DNA successfully. And then

1204
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,440
we're looking at other molecular markers

1205
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,400
uh to see ho how the effect of that alil

1206
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,480
is on other uh other parameters. So each

1207
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,920
cell is its own experiment here um

1208
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,319
because in the population some are

1209
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,160
edited some are not uh and then when we

1210
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,160
define the downstream uh effects of the

1211
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,160
alals we can simply compare the cells

1212
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,520
that we edited in the same experiment to

1213
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,440
the ones that we didn't. Um so so here's

1214
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,960
a particular uh snip that I think is

1215
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,520
really interesting. Uh this is a snip

1216
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,599
that causes type 1 diabetes, asthma,

1217
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,119
lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It

1218
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,160
plays a role in a lot of autoimmune

1219
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,640
diseases. It's near a gene called IL2.

1220
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,440
Um and when we apply this technology uh

1221
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,160
and we look at aector T- cells, um we

1222
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,160
see that what whatever uh version of the

1223
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,440
snip we introduce that it doesn't really

1224
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,119
have an effect on IL2 protein. uh on the

1225
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,119
other hand when we look at regulatory T-

1226
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,040
cells the kind of te- cells that reduce

1227
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,760
inflammation what we see is that this

1228
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,640
snip uh actually increases the

1229
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,960
expression of IL2 protein so individuals

1230
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
that have the protective T alil they

1231
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,760
actually have a higher expression of

1232
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,760
CD25 but they do so um specifically in

1233
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,680
the regulatory T- cell and not the other

1234
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,920
kind of T- cell. So what does that what

1235
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,000
does that mean? So um so the results

1236
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,079
prove that the RA protective alil

1237
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,480
increases IL2RA.

1238
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,119
Um but the alil that drives reduced risk

1239
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,880
acts in T- cells uh in in T- rags but

1240
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,800
not other T- cells. Um and the

1241
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,160
provocative idea here is that this

1242
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,760
indicates a cell state specific

1243
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,560
mechanism. So if you want to develop a

1244
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,000
therapy towards IL2 or IL2, you really

1245
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,440
need to think about which TE- cells

1246
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,560
you're going after and it probably

1247
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,560
really needs to be specific for

1248
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,880
regulatory T- cells. Um and such a

1249
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,920
therapy may be uh most effective in

1250
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,560
those individuals that have

1251
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,920
dysfunctional many dysfunctional T-regs

1252
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,160
uh operating in their inflamed tissues.

1253
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,000
Um so I come back to this. So um so

1254
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,560
hopefully I've I've convinced you um

1255
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,960
that it's useful to think about genetics

1256
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,800
um and the immune system together. um

1257
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,640
thinking about observational immunology

1258
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,000
data finds a lot of the changes that

1259
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,160
occur in the tissue that might be

1260
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,720
important and the genetics helps to get

1261
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,880
uh us to causal mechanisms that we can

1262
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:58,800
we can maybe target. Um so um so before

1263
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,079
before I close um I hope uh you know

1264
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,440
we've answered some of these questions.

1265
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,520
Can we use genetics to define

1266
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,680
therapeutics for autoimmune diseases? Um

1267
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,160
I think the answer is yes. uh the

1268
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,680
genetics has already pointed to many uh

1269
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,599
useful regions of the genome that are

1270
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,359
already being used therapeutically. So I

1271
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,200
think there's a lot of promise there. Uh

1272
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,839
can we define very specific mechanisms

1273
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,839
for those therap

1274
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:58,960
[Applause]

1275
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,119
Thank you so much, Shoma. That was

1276
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,640
fantastic. If there are any questions in

1277
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,720
the audience, like I said, we've got mic

1278
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,319
runners who just raise your hand and

1279
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,240
they'll come over with a microphone so

1280
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,800
that you have an opportunity. Uh and

1281
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,480
again if you're watching online um

1282
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,559
please type your your question into

1283
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,200
YouTube chat and I will try to work it

1284
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:20,960
into the conversation. Um just real

1285
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,559
quick so how did you get involved and

1286
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,640
interested in this kind of work? You

1287
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,240
know what drew you to rheumatology and

1288
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,160
and autoimmune diseases and

1289
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,760
autoinflammatory diseases and what sort

1290
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,319
of inspired you to start researching

1291
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,440
them and also on the clinical side too?

1292
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,160
>> Yeah. Um you know it's it's a a bit of a

1293
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,079
strange story. So uh when I was a

1294
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:44,160
medical student I mostly used to think

1295
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:49,200
about um you know statistics algorithms

1296
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,720
modeling data um and um uh when I

1297
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,800
started doing my clinical work I I don't

1298
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,400
think I had any good sense of what kind

1299
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,079
of clinical work I'd want to do and

1300
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,920
maybe I wasn't even sure I want to do

1301
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,119
any kind of clinical work at the time.

1302
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,839
Um but um but I found the autoimmune

1303
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,119
diseases really interesting um in part

1304
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,160
because they don't follow any rules. Um

1305
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:14,640
so it sort of made me use a different

1306
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:19,040
part of me um which is you know the more

1307
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:21,280
um you know intuitive uh approach to a

1308
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,079
patient you know making decisions based

1309
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,280
on a physical exam by by listening to

1310
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,640
the patient's story. And I actually

1311
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,920
found that very appealing probably

1312
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,280
because I was spending so much time on

1313
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,079
algorithms and statistics and such

1314
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,599
things. So, so um so yeah, I found

1315
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,359
basically it was it was that I found the

1316
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,520
patients really interesting.

1317
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,160
>> So the cells the diseases are rebellious

1318
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,160
and so are you.

1319
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,240
>> Maybe maybe over here. Yes.

1320
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,720
>> Hi. Could you speak to the concept of

1321
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,640
timing in terms of like for example

1322
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,559
therapeutic targets over the course of a

1323
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,839
disease where earlier on there might be

1324
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,920
a different target you're looking at

1325
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,240
versus later on the cell state might

1326
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,000
change looking at a completely different

1327
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,119
kind of beast in terms of therapeutic

1328
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,720
targets.

1329
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,760
>> Yeah, I think it's a great it's a great

1330
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,280
question. Um you know uh and I guess

1331
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,359
maybe I can talk about it a little bit

1332
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,559
in the context of rheumatoid arthritis.

1333
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:16,800
So um you know if you talk to

1334
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,839
rheumatologists in the pre- therapeutic

1335
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,119
era right um uh now I think we have so

1336
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,640
many therapies that it's it's a little

1337
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,880
bit difficult to know what the natural

1338
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,240
history of the disease is. Uh but if you

1339
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,000
talk to people in the pre- therapeutic

1340
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,520
era they would talk about a thing called

1341
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,480
burnedout RA um which probably wasn't

1342
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,960
really burned out but the idea was that

1343
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,880
you know the the sort of swollen hot

1344
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,720
joints that you're seeing early on that

1345
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,200
over time you don't you don't see that

1346
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,240
right? So there is some kind of change

1347
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,079
um you know in the immunology um in

1348
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,079
terms of tissue inflammation at least in

1349
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,319
in RA um and we certainly do see

1350
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,240
individuals where you know they do well

1351
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,400
on a drug for a little while and then it

1352
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,000
stops working as well for them.

1353
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,359
Difficult to know if they've you know

1354
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,720
developed some kind of tolerance to the

1355
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,559
drug. Sometimes people develop

1356
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,480
antibodies to the drugs, but sometimes

1357
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,319
it could also be that the disease is

1358
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,079
just evolving and the particular drug

1359
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,920
we're using no longer works for that

1360
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,079
patient because the disease has shifted

1361
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,760
into something else. Um, so I think it's

1362
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,760
a really uh really important question.

1363
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,760
It's probably not a one-sizefits-all

1364
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,400
answer because obviously different

1365
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,400
diseases are different.

1366
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,160
>> Thank you Sha. Fascinating uh

1367
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,160
presentation and very impressive body of

1368
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:36,720
work. Um I was particularly struck by

1369
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,559
that slide which you showed uh

1370
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,280
hetrogenity of cell composition in the

1371
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,000
sinovium across multiple patients in the

1372
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,119
six groups that you've defined. I was

1373
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,960
wondering um you know for those patients

1374
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:53,280
on average given the 150 genetic loi or

1375
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,040
risk lolli that have been identified on

1376
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
average how many risk side of the

1377
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,559
patient carry

1378
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,960
um and whether that is different across

1379
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,880
these genetic uh these cellular

1380
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:07,200
heterogenity based groups that you have

1381
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,920
identified and if it is indeed this

1382
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,520
multisellular and you know

1383
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,160
multifphenotypic

1384
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,480
why do we still think that single target

1385
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,640
agents, therapeutic agents will work for

1386
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,880
any patient when they have multiple

1387
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,599
snips and multiple cell types involved.

1388
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,480
Thanks.

1389
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:27,280
>> Uh great great question. So um so the

1390
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,359
150 uh LOSI they're all common alals,

1391
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,040
right? So um so at every of those 150

1392
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,599
you can imagine that people have zero,

1393
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,040
one or two risk alals. Um it's pretty

1394
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:41,599
much if you add them all up it's like a

1395
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,440
bell-shaped curve, right? Um so you know

1396
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,880
in some sense most people have half the

1397
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,800
risk alals and half the protective

1398
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,000
alals. Um and some people have a little

1399
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,720
bit more and some people have a little

1400
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,359
bit less. Um there are some individuals

1401
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,040
who will have an extreme number of them.

1402
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,280
And you know for those individuals you

1403
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,240
can imagine that the risk goes up from

1404
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,280
you know half a percent to 1% to 2% to

1405
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,440
3%. But the genetics for most autoimmune

1406
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,839
diseases aren't really that predictive.

1407
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,160
um you know in the sense that um you

1408
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,599
know a 23 and me test probably is never

1409
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,839
going to get to a point that it's going

1410
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,359
to really tell you who's going to get RA

1411
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,880
um you know so if you have a twin

1412
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,599
sibling an identical twin sibling that

1413
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,760
has rheumatoid arthritis your risk of RA

1414
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:23,119
goes from half a percent to about 10%.

1415
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,800
So that's like perfect genomic

1416
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,480
information, right? And it's still not

1417
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,040
that predictive. So it's useful in terms

1418
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,280
of understanding mechanism, less useful

1419
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,559
in terms of, you know, doing doing

1420
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,200
predictions about what's going to happen

1421
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,520
to whom. Um

1422
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,680
the single target versus multi-target

1423
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,280
strategy is a really interesting

1424
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,520
question and one that I think has dogged

1425
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,760
our field. Um you know I I think many of

1426
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,599
us uh including me think that there's a

1427
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,079
tremendous benefit to you know going

1428
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,000
after multiple bi biologics at the same

1429
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,359
time. Now as it turns out you know some

1430
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,480
of this is just about drug development

1431
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:01,280
right that that you know u before we had

1432
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,119
antibbody types of targeted therapies.

1433
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,960
We had non-specific therapies which were

1434
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,400
small molecules. Many of them we still

1435
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,040
don't know exactly what they do or why

1436
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,400
they work. Um you know rheumatoid

1437
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,839
arthritis we used to treat with gold

1438
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,880
shots. I think we still don't know why

1439
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,319
we did that. Um, and whether you know

1440
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,119
there's controversial how well it

1441
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:21,359
worked. Uh, a lot of a lot of belief

1442
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,319
that it did work. Um, I wasn't around

1443
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,920
for that era. Um, so I think the

1444
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,680
targeted therapeutics are great because

1445
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,400
we know what we're doing. We know we

1446
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,880
know what we're going after. Um, it's

1447
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,480
probably true. It's definitely true. Um,

1448
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,160
that using multiple targeted

1449
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,839
therapeutics in an individual may be

1450
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,440
beneficial. Um, and now we're starting

1451
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,079
to see data on seroriatic arthritis

1452
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,040
where that's the case. The downside of

1453
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,359
it is that going after two major

1454
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,280
components of immune system is scary,

1455
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,880
right? Um, and you may be, you know,

1456
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,480
each of them may be synergistically

1457
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,799
working to make your patient

1458
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,559
particularly imunocmpromised. So my

1459
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,079
argument is that what you probably

1460
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,240
really want are ter targeted

1461
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,799
therapeutics that are very specific.

1462
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,240
That's a good thing, but uh but spec

1463
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,640
going after specific molecules in

1464
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,760
specific cell contexts, right? So you're

1465
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,680
not taking out like an like two massive

1466
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,079
pillars of the immune system. Rather,

1467
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,960
you're taking out two pillars but you

1468
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,400
know in in some very specific places um

1469
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,160
so that you'd have the benefit of

1470
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,599
getting the tissue inflammation down

1471
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:27,240
without wreaking havoc um you know in

1472
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,240
terms of immune susceptibility.

1473
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,839
Hi, thank you so much for your talk. Um,

1474
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,839
I had a question on the environmental

1475
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,799
component of disease. So, you mentioned

1476
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:47,520
that environmental factors will trigger

1477
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:49,920
you know genetic susceptibility and I

1478
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,079
was wondering to what extent can we

1479
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,680
prevent those factors and could you

1480
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,200
enlighten us on what those factors are?

1481
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,559
Yeah. So, you know, some of those risk

1482
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,200
factors are known and some of them are

1483
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,400
are less well known. Um I maybe I'll

1484
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,359
talk about two of them that I think are

1485
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,160
pretty pretty clearly established. Um uh

1486
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,920
one is smoking. Um so, you know, smoking

1487
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,760
is bad for you for a lot of reasons. And

1488
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,520
from an autoimmune point of view, that's

1489
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,480
another way in which it's bad for you.

1490
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:21,119
So, um uh for rheumatoid arthritis, the

1491
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,200
the your risk of uh RA more than doubles

1492
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,920
uh if you if you smoke cigarettes on a

1493
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,559
on a regular basis. Um so that's a

1494
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,280
modifiable risk factor. Um another risk

1495
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,040
factor um that I can tell you about is

1496
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,440
uh with multiple sclerosis now we've

1497
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,640
come to realize that there's a a viral

1498
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,880
trigger. Um for most autoimmune diseases

1499
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,680
there's been a sort of ongoing debate

1500
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,720
about whether viruses trigger it uh or

1501
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,720
not and to what extent uh it might. Um

1502
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,559
and it's it's very difficult to to you

1503
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,559
know do the right epidemiological

1504
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,480
studies or the right clinical studies to

1505
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,839
really separate that out. But in the

1506
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,760
last three to four years I think the

1507
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,520
evidence for multiple sclerosis being

1508
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,880
caused by Epstein bar virus has become

1509
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:05,040
overwhelming. Um and so um so Epstein

1510
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,280
bar virus is one that we think probably

1511
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:10,640
causes u multiple sclerosis. Um

1512
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,200
it's a little difficult to know what to

1513
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,160
do with that one because most of us have

1514
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:20,000
been infected with uh Epstein bar. Um

1515
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,079
and maybe um the the problem with

1516
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,240
autoimmunity is not that you get

1517
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,760
infected with it, it's that you get

1518
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,480
infected later in life with it than

1519
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,599
earlier in life. Um so so there's some

1520
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,720
interesting questions one could ask

1521
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,640
about, you know, whether we should be

1522
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,240
vaccinating everyone for EBV to prevent

1523
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,839
multiple sclerosis or whether we should

1524
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,559
be exposing everyone early on so they

1525
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:41,359
don't get it later on and and and be be

1526
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:44,160
put at put at risk. Um so those are

1527
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,000
those are two um two risk factors that

1528
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,960
um that I can I can speak to with

1529
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,079
confidence.

1530
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,319
>> We did have a question from online which

1531
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,960
I need to find again.

1532
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,799
Ah what do you see as the benefits and

1533
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,640
challenges of personalized medicine for

1534
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,240
rheumatoid arthritis? you know, from a

1535
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:06,079
farmer production angle, it's easier to

1536
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:08,559
massproduce drugs um than to like come

1537
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,240
up with individual treatments or small

1538
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,160
batches of treatments or like antibodies

1539
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,359
that might work for one small set of

1540
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,079
patients and not another set of

1541
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,200
patients.

1542
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,640
>> Yeah. So, you know, I think for

1543
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,599
rheumatoid arthritis, we're actually

1544
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,599
incredibly fortunate that there are, you

1545
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,359
know, dozens of of I mean, there's a lot

1546
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,839
of different treatments for RA right

1547
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,599
now. Um and and this is something that's

1548
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,480
really changed from back you know from

1549
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,720
when I met Hal uh as a medical student

1550
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,960
there there really wasn't a such a

1551
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,960
spectrum of diseases. So we can go after

1552
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,480
B cells we can go after tumor necrosis

1553
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,119
factor we can go after T- cell

1554
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,280
activation. Um so often the challenge is

1555
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,880
really um there's a subset of

1556
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,720
individuals we certainly aren't treating

1557
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,720
and we need something better for them.

1558
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,000
Uh but for the rest of the individuals

1559
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,640
there's a huge question of how do we

1560
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,960
find the right right medication. Um, so

1561
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,280
I don't think that involves creating

1562
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,440
lots of individual, you know, treatments

1563
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,680
for individual patients. It involves

1564
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,359
simply matchmaking the right patient to

1565
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,680
the right drug. I think one of the

1566
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:12,079
barriers for us is that um because so

1567
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,839
much of um what we do in many autoimmune

1568
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,079
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis

1569
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,440
is huristic, right? You see a patient,

1570
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,240
they look a certain way, they're sort of

1571
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,880
active, you try a drug, you work your

1572
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,720
way down a ladder. um you're not

1573
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,160
actually collecting the data that you

1574
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,200
need to make that decision. You're not

1575
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,880
getting the biopsy of the joint. Um and

1576
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,160
we don't to make matters worse, we don't

1577
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,480
know what to do with that information if

1578
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,760
we got it. Um but you know, I think some

1579
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,160
of the data I showed you shows that

1580
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:41,920
there's information there um that maybe

1581
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,000
we could exploit. Um and maybe that

1582
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,520
could help us make some rational choices

1583
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,040
so that we're not spending, you know,

1584
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,760
years trying to find the right drug for

1585
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,520
for a lot of our patients.

1586
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,319
Well, thank you very much, Shomo. Thank

1587
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,559
you also to the Elean Hector Memorial

1588
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,319
Fund for supporting this evening's talk.

1589
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,400
Thank you and also like to again

1590
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:02,319
acknowledge Ellen's family and loved

1591
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,079
ones who are watching us this evening.

1592
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,880
Thank you all to everyone in the room

1593
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,160
for coming out tonight. Uh I again

1594
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,000
invite you all to join us for a

1595
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,880
reception in the Broad Discovery Center.

1596
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,440
And please uh keep an eye out for the

1597
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,880
fall um the fall event in the broad

1598
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,240
discovery series. We're working on who

1599
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,760
our next speaker is going to be. That

1600
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:23,470
news should be released shortly. Thank

1601
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:27,820
you again and have a great night.

1602
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:27,820
[Applause]
