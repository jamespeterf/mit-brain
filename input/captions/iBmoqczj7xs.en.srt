1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,679
okay today we're going to do our second

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,480
lecture on

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,000
monopolies uh remember once again to set

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,800
the picture if we want to figure out how

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
much producers are going to produce we

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,720
need to know what Market structure they

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,240
sell into that's the sort of final

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,599
condition we need to pin down how much

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,800
producers produce we started with a

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,559
particular Market structure which was

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,079
perfect competition and showed how under

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,480
perfect competition with price equals

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,280
marginal cost we can pin down how much

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,640
producers produce we then turned last

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
lecture to an alternative Market

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,239
structure really The Other Extreme which

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,640
is Monopoly with only one firm in the

18
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,320
market and we showed how that can pin

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,920
down what producers produce but we also

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
showed that monopo breaks the link

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,600
between the positive equilibrium outcome

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,600
and the normative concept of efficiency

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,799
that we have an equilibrium outcome that

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
unlike with perfect competition is

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,159
inefficient we create a dead weight loss

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,159
because monopolists don't sell units

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,960
that they can produce more cheaply than

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,119
people are willing to pay for them and

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
they don't do that because they don't

30
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,560
want to poison their sales they don't

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
have to lower the price enough to get

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
additional

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,920
sales now what we're going to talk about

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,799
today is a couple topics within Monopoly

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,119
the first topic we'll talk about is

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,360
where do monopolies come from from so

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,600
how do monopolies arise or the origin of

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,280
Monopoly If you're sort of a marble fan

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,280
well this is our origin

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,920
story okay no no radioactive spiders or

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,240
anything okay but rather we're going to

42
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,759
talk about markets where Monopoly is

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,240
sort of inevitable and natural in

44
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,479
particular we'll talk about today

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,119
natural

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,680
monopolies natural monopolies

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,240
arise whenever there's a market

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,799
where for all relevant

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,679
quantities average cost is

50
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,840
falling in other words fixed cost is so

51
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,319
large relative to marginal cost you

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
remember our typical average cost curve

53
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,920
Falls and then

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,519
Rises we're going to have an example

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,319
where fixed costs are so large average

56
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,400
cost is always falling so for example

57
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,000
the classic example we' use is is like

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,519
producing Rock from a rock quarry you've

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,319
got to dig up Rock from this rock quarry

60
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,760
it's one resource there's one sort of

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,760
for historical reasons there's one

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,360
geological site where we can dig up

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
Rock okay it's a huge fixed cost finding

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,879
it digging it

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,000
out but the truth is creating a second

66
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,519
Rock cor would be incredible fixed cost

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
so the fixed cost of doing another one

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,720
is small relative to the ongoing

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,959
marginal cost or more generally this is

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
something where basically uh you would

71
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,280
see this in any sort of

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,840
utility like delivering water to houses

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,879
if you deliver water to houses you have

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,879
this incredibly expensive Enterprise of

75
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,799
laying all the pipes to deliver the

76
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,799
water and then the marginal cost is

77
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,840
pretty trivial you just pumped the water

78
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,720
through so the fixed costs are so

79
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,799
enormous that they're going to dwarf the

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,840
marginal cost for any relevant

81
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,000
quantity and we'll see what that looks

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,239
like in figure

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,680
121 figure 121 is a picture where the

84
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,120
average costs are everywhere above the

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,319
marginal

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
cost for all relevant quantities now

87
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,439
it's true could produce enough there's

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,879
some quantity for which average cost

89
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,760
will fall below marginal cost and start

90
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,560
to rise again but basically idea is the

91
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,360
range where average cost is falling

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
extends to the entire relevant range not

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,319
just the beginning as in previous

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,879
examples why is this cause Monopoly it

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,879
causes Monopoly because the it creates

96
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,599
such a barrier to entry that no one else

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,840
can enter imagine you tried imagine you

98
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,319
saw this Market you saw this water

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,079
utility okay and you said look there's

100
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,599
profits be made average costs above

101
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,079
marginal

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,920
cost okay is is is declining above

103
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,120
marginal cost there's profits to be made

104
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,640
because average cost is falling I'm

105
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,560
going to enter okay what would the

106
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,560
existing firm

107
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,759
do what could the exist the ex existing

108
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,880
firm that's already invested in the

109
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,600
water pipes you say I'm going to lay a

110
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,960
whole new set of water pipes and sell

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,639
water more cheaply what would they

112
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,000
do what would existing firm do

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,880
well you're an existing firm you've laid

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,479
these water pipes you have this graph in

115
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,240
front of you you're setting your price

116
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,840
at some level well above marginal cost

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,919
what do you

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,479
do yeah lower your price if you lower

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,080
your price to marginal cost no firm no

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,400
other firm can make money because then

121
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,479
price is below average cost and you lose

122
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,919
money but for you you've already paid

123
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,720
the fixed costs so for you you're still

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,320
making money in the marginal unit so

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,240
yeah the existing fir just lowers its

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
price towards marginal cost below

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
average cost any other firm looks and

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
says look I can't make back my average

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,160
cost I'm not going to enter once you

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
scare them off you raise your price back

131
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,759
up so in a market like this it is

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,960
natural it's indeed proper to only have

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,120
one firm it makes no sense to have a

134
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,400
second set of pipes going all the way

135
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,360
through the town delivering water to

136
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,160
houses it just makes no sense so in this

137
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,919
case a monopoly is

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,240
natural and this is basically an example

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,720
where a fixed cost

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,680
creates a barrier to entry the fixed

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
cost is so large that you never enter

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
remember I talked about how we never

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,919
have perpect competition because there's

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
always some slight barried entry someone

145
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,039
can beat you up if you try to L sell

146
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,479
additional you know uh little eiel ta

147
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,440
Tower figures or whatever there's always

148
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,720
some fixed always in bar entry here the

149
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,759
bar entry is so large because the nor as

150
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,880
fixed cost basically no one's ever once

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
someone's in no one else is ever going

152
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,199
to enter and therefore it's a natural

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,680
monopoly

154
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,520
yeah well with there's nobody delivering

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,199
water there's money to be made because

156
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,440
the first room is Monopoly we know

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,080
monopolies make profits so if there's no

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,759
one they can come in and lay the pipes

159
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,919
and make and make money now you might

160
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,199
say how do they know someone else won't

161
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
come in lay and faster that's an

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,639
interesting that's exactly the kind of

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
fun stuff we don't have time to get into

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,199
in this class but if you take Game

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,880
Theory

166
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,120
1412 uh they'll teach you all about how

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
we think about these different things

168
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,479
and I'll get into that I'm going to do a

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,319
couple exra in Game Theory but not

170
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,800
nearly enough but think of it as one

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,479
firm just sort of happen to go first and

172
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,319
they own it

173
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,960
okay other

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,560
questions so that's one reason One Way

175
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
monopolies can arise another way

176
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,479
monopolies can arise so one way is a

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,479
natural monopoly another way monopolies

178
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,919
can arise is the government can create

179
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,120
monopolies the government can actually

180
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,039
create monopolies one is by actually

181
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,319
literally delivering the service so in

182
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,759
most countries when they're young

183
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960
governments do a lot of things we think

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,280
is private now like they run the

185
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,960
airlines they run the steel industry

186
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,560
they run the banks and even in mature

187
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,639
economies governments still do some

188
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,840
services like run the Postal

189
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,120
Service there's activities that

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,360
governments can just do and say we're

191
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,560
goingon to have the Monopoly on them and

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,560
we are going to deliver these Services

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,280
now as as economies mature typically

194
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,720
those get shifted off to the private

195
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,680
sector okay and we'll we'll come back a

196
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,599
little bit to that but basically uh that

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,800
is sort of one way the more common way

198
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,000
that so one way of government Crea

199
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,080
Monopoly is through

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,520
delivery but the more common way of

201
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,840
government cre Monopoly is through

202
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,120
property rights in particular patents

203
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,120
and

204
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,120
copyrights we talked about copyright

205
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:51,000
last time with huckin and Fahrenheit

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,960
451 but a patent is basically an

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,560
exclusive right to sell a good for some

208
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,879
period of time in the US 17 years

209
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,520
typically so the way patent work you

210
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,680
file for a patent if it's granted then

211
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,720
you are essentially a time limit of

212
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,280
Monopoly you have the exclusive right to

213
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,039
sell that

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,759
good so what how do we feel about

215
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,919
patents well in fact there's a good and

216
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,919
a bad side what's the bad side of

217
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,039
patents what's the bad side of offering

218
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,960
patents yeah it's a monopoly you create

219
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,719
deadweight loss it's inefficient what's

220
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,240
the good side offering

221
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,000
patents

222
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,039
yeah yeah you basically why invent

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,159
something if you can't make any money

224
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,200
off it they create incentives to

225
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,839
innovate and invent because there's no

226
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
patents the me you invented something

227
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,600
someone to just steal it and produce it

228
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
at marginal cost or marginal cost plus

229
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,640
Epson you wouldn't make any money so why

230
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,680
put the work in so it's a tradeoff with

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
patents between incentives for

232
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,320
investment for

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:03,040
Innovation and Monopoly costs to uh

234
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,880
to Consumers so basically the optimal

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,320
patent trades off these concerns you

236
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,640
want a patent that gives enough rights

237
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,959
to incent

238
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,200
Innovation and not so much rights that

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,279
you overly hurt

240
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,640
consumers so for example let's take

241
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,079
Pharmaceuticals developing a new drug is

242
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,839
incredibly

243
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,959
expensive roughly speaking um about one

244
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,360
in every

245
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,839
10,000 compounds you try is going to end

246
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,920
up working in terms of being effective

247
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,680
drug once you have a compound that you

248
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,320
think works you do animal testing in

249
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,360
Phase then you have to do three levels

250
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
of human

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
testing the best estimates although

252
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,920
they're rough is that developing a New

253
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Drug in the US today costs about2

254
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,600
billion

255
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,519
doar about2 billion not not not if you

256
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,560
knew ahead it was going to work but if

257
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,839
you take all the failures along the way

258
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,240
on average by the time you develop the

259
00:09:51,839 --> 00:10:00,120
drug you spent $2 billion that's a lot

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:02,200
of money okay so basically um what we do

261
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,760
is we give a patent for 17 years and

262
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,360
then when the patent expires other

263
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,560
companies allowed to enter brce what's

264
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,560
called generic drugs so you have a name

265
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,720
brand drug you invent it you get 17

266
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,800
years and then after those 17 years

267
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,760
anybody can enter it the formulation

268
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,279
becomes public and they just produce it

269
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,680
at marginal cost and your profits all go

270
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,880
away in theory that's how it works and

271
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,360
in theory we'd have an easy solution we

272
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,480
just say well well set up an

273
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,720
optimization problem where you optimize

274
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,120
the incentives to innovate versus the

275
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,360
losses to Consumers clearly the optim

276
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,959
will not be a patent last

277
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,079
forever and clearly optim will not be no

278
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,240
patent it'll be somewhere in between who

279
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,160
knows the 17 years right but you could

280
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,800
you could the economics gives the tools

281
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,440
to think about this trade-off now right

282
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,200
the problem is in practice it doesn't

283
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,160
work that well there's a lot of problems

284
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,120
with the patent system the first is that

285
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,079
companies have a lot of incentive to

286
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
think up creative ways to effectively

287
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,399
extend their

288
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,839
patent okay so for example one thing

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,720
drug companies will do is do something

290
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,279
called pay for delay let's say I've got

291
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,600
some name Brad brand drug and Pedro is a

292
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,399
potential generic uh innovator he wants

293
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,279
to enter and make my drug and I say

294
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,480
Pedro look I'm making like a billion

295
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,600
year on this drug you're a a generate

296
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,560
guy you're not going to make much money

297
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,680
because you're coming in competitive

298
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
market I'll pay you $500 million not to

299
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,160
come in

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,360
Pat's like great I didn't do I got

301
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,760
$500 million I'm still making $500

302
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,519
million in

303
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,639
profits so I can effectively extend my

304
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,519
patent or what I can do is I can tweak

305
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,120
the formulation and apply for a new

306
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,720
patent so for example insulin is

307
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,399
incredibly cheap to

308
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,959
make okay and it was invented the

309
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,920
inventors were academics who gave away

310
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,320
the patent for a dollar because they

311
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,639
wanted to be publicly available but it

312
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,839
cost a ton of money why because there's

313
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,160
always Innovations and delivering in

314
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,480
that make it a little more efficient a

315
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,839
little better now they are true

316
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,160
Innovations but each one extends the

317
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,800
patent and makes insulin more expensive

318
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,360
and that trade-off is not really what

319
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,519
was what we're that's sort of a

320
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,560
different way in the system is supposed

321
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,160
to work so that's one reason this

322
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,839
doesn't work the other reason is that

323
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,000
generic markets aren't as competitive as

324
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,720
we'd like to think so

325
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,720
epipens which are now epinephrine is a

326
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,880
generic drug still cost $600

327
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,399
why epens cost $600 because it turns out

328
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,040
it's expensive to make an EpiPen the

329
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,279
delivery device and stuff is expensive

330
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,959
and firms aren't

331
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,839
entering and as we'll talk about

332
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,440
starting next lecture unless you have

333
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,279
perfect competition there'll be profits

334
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,839
and there'll be dead weight

335
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,199
loss okay that's the second

336
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,000
reason a third reason is the biggest

337
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,000
challenge yet which is for the new class

338
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,399
of drugs being made called

339
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,160
biologics which are not stable small

340
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,560
cell stable large cell I'm sorry drug

341
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,399
development but literally drugs that are

342
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,240
developed and injected and are

343
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,399
essentially um formulated they're

344
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,360
biological formulations that are live

345
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,760
effectively it's hard to make an

346
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,279
effective

347
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,920
generic and so generic composition May

348
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,399
simply not exist for these new biologic

349
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
drugs which is the new class of drugs

350
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,519
which are making incredible uh steps and

351
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,600
let's be clear the innovation in

352
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,760
Pharmaceuticals is

353
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,160
unbelievable okay just one example

354
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,639
there's a horrible horrible disease

355
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,800
called spin or muscular

356
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,920
atrophy if the baby if your B it's a

357
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,760
genetic disease purely random if you're

358
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,639
born with it your life is brutal

359
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,560
miserable and you're dead by two I mean

360
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,360
awful can't imagine anything worse as

361
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,560
app parent they've cured it they

362
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,920
developed a miracle cure it's a new

363
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
called selling gene therapy would

364
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,000
literally inject a virus in the baby's

365
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,360
body containing a new patched Gene it

366
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,920
goes through the body and repairs it

367
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,079
it's a miracle it's the kind of thing

368
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,320
you guys are doing here at MIT every day

369
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,560
and it's only going to get better this

370
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,920
drug cost $2.1

371
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,079
million now on the one hand I say $2.1

372
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,199
million that's a lot of money on the

373
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,000
other hand you're saving a baby's life

374
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,240
you are adding potentially 80 to 100

375
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,720
years of life to someone21 million is

376
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,680
actually a pretty good deal on the other

377
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,759
hand if we develop drugs for everything

378
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,160
like this we'll bankrupt our country so

379
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,199
these are the kind of difficult issues

380
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,759
we raise in wanting give incenters for

381
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,720
Innovation but also being ultimately

382
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,759
affordable uh in terms of what consumers

383
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,160
need to Consumers need to

384
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,160
buy okay questions about

385
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:40,000
that okay and this is if this is

386
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,079
something that interests you um this is

387
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,800
a big debate in the US right now as part

388
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,560
of President Biden's uh inflation

389
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,160
reduction act the IRA the government for

390
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,399
the first time is actually regulating

391
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
the price of pharmaceuticals it's

392
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,600
actually saying to some Pharmaceuticals

393
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,160
that have competitors look you know

394
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,399
we're going to regulate your price

395
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,680
because we think you're making too much

396
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,199
money the government's decide the patent

397
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
system isn't working it's out of balance

398
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,920
and so drug companies are making too

399
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,320
much money and they're regulating prices

400
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,680
and that was very controversial and uh a

401
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,639
significant step forward in how we think

402
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,720
about drug pricing in the US and you can

403
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
read more about that if that's something

404
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,120
that interests you and certainly if you

405
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,920
want to go into bi biological

406
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,600
engineering or or or any of those fields

407
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,639
this is something important to know

408
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,839
about okay so that's the first topic I

409
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,880
want to cover where do monopolies come

410
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:28,319
from the second topic I want to cover is

411
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,199
addressing Monopoly because this is

412
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:33,079
where things get exciting from my

413
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,279
perspective I'm a big government liberal

414
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,839
okay I think government can do good

415
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,360
things yet everything I've taught you in

416
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
this course government's the bad guy

417
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,120
okay I don't like that but that's the

418
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
way Bates economics works and let's be

419
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,959
clear that that's the proper way to

420
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
teach the first half of this course the

421
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,839
first fundamental theorem of what for

422
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,839
economics says government only does bad

423
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,720
things okay but that's not true in

424
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,199
reality and here's the first case we get

425
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,560
to see where government can potentially

426
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:02,160
but not obviously make things better and

427
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,160
that is through regulating

428
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,639
monopolies so for example let's go to

429
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,240
figure

430
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,240
122 figure 122 is the same figure we

431
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,120
ended with last time you've got a

432
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,079
marginal cost curve a demand curve and a

433
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,040
marginal revenue curve the marginal ring

434
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,399
curve intersects marginal costs at six

435
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,319
units producing six units you respect

436
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:25,800
the demand curve you charge a price of

437
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,319
18 six units get produced we get a dead

438
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,279
weight loss of C plus

439
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,959
e so as we said the market outcome is

440
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,399
not

441
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:38,839
efficient what can the government do

442
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,680
well what if the government set a price

443
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,199
ceiling and said we are not going to let

444
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,399
the monopolist charge more than

445
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,639
16 we not going to let the monopolis

446
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,319
charge more than

447
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:56,600
16 well then the new marginal cost curve

448
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,160
from for the monopolist the new supply

449
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,920
curve

450
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,319
or or the new it's essentially the new

451
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,880
uh marginal revenue curve I'm sorry the

452
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:08,799
new marginal revenue curve becomes the

453
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,160
flat line all the way to point e what is

454
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,039
that e c it should be that intersection

455
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,559
of the red and blue lines the flat line

456
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,720
all the point that little e e z I guess

457
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,559
it looks like it should be EC and then

458
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,039
it drops the dash line down you go back

459
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,679
to the old margin Revenue curve so you

460
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,520
draw the solid line from the 16 on the

461
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,120
y- axis over to the what looks like e0

462
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,600
follow that dash line down and then

463
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,960
rejoin the original marginal revenue

464
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,320
curve that's the new marginal revenue

465
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,440
curve why well think about what marginal

466
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,520
revenue

467
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,000
is okay if you

468
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,760
produce remember in the old world if you

469
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,520
produce the seventh

470
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,440
unit okay your marginal revenue is your

471
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,440
your profits fall because of the

472
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,679
poisoning effect but now if you produce

473
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,960
the seventh unit you can only charge 16

474
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,039
that's the most you can

475
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,880
charge so you might as well produce it

476
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:06,320
at if you can only charge 16 if that's

477
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,080
the limit then at that point your your

478
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,200
costs are

479
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,360
below your marginal revenue so you

480
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,039
produce in other words the marginal

481
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,240
revenue in the old point when you went

482
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,559
to the seventh

483
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,799
unit marginal cost was above marginal

484
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,640
revenue now going to the seventh unit

485
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,960
it's not because we haven't let you

486
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,720
raised your price so the government by

487
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,520
regulating and saying the price has to

488
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,559
be set at 16

489
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,240
is essentially taking away the poisoning

490
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,320
effect the poisoning effect

491
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,600
arises because if I want to sell one

492
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,159
moreon have to lower my price well here

493
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,120
your price is already low I haven't let

494
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,280
you raise your price I haven't let you

495
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,240
set it at

496
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,320
18 before you didn't want to sell the

497
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,200
seventh unit you lower your price to 17

498
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,960
right well now your price is already 16

499
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,880
so why not sell the seventh

500
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,559
Unit 16 is still above marginal cost so

501
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,919
why not do it so essentially the optimal

502
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,320
solution from the monopolis then is to

503
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
sell eight

504
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,000
to sell the competitive quantity if you

505
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,280
tell the monopolis they can't charge

506
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,520
more than 16 they have they will they

507
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,960
will sell the competitive quantity and

508
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,200
guess what dead weight loss has gone

509
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,880
away we're now selling the

510
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,440
competitive amount and dead weight loss

511
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,720
is going

512
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,600
away

513
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,080
okay

514
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,720
so let's think about an example of this

515
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,760
and how the government could make things

516
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,600
better okay and let's come to a case of

517
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,880
a natural monopoly which is

518
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,000
broadband Broadband

519
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,960
delivery to deliver Broadband it's not a

520
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
fully natural monopoly and that multiple

521
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,960
people can lay the lines that come to

522
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,320
your house but it's a big fixed cost if

523
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,400
you want to set up a Broadband

524
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,120
competitor you have to go out and lay a

525
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,640
whole bunch of new fiber cable okay

526
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,120
that's expensive it's not infinite it's

527
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,200
not like a water utility it's doable and

528
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,720
it happens but it's pretty expensive

529
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,159
competition will be definitely Limited

530
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
may not be natural monopoly certainly

531
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,120
natural oligopoly you're not going to

532
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
have hundreds of firms laying these

533
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,559
wires getting price making prices

534
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,799
competitive okay so for example across

535
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:15,919
20,000 us zip codes

536
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,600
70% have either zero or

537
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,760
one option for 25 uh for 25 megabytes

538
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,360
per second

539
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,600
service okay zero or one on is that a

540
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,760
megabytes per second I say that right I

541
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,400
think so I hope so Mbps I think I got

542
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,640
that right uh Z One

543
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,840
options okay even at the lowest possible

544
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,000
speed of internet service only 30% of

545
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,799
zip codes have more than one option for

546
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,799
getting Broadband 30% of America has

547
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,840
only one option for getting their

548
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,880
Broadband why because it's a natural

549
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,919
monopoly in many cases the costs are

550
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
really high if you're in some rural town

551
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,080
it's not effective to lay a second set

552
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,559
of wires going to people's

553
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,799
houses okay as a result

554
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,360
prices are high and there's Monopoly

555
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,799
power now you might say well John and

556
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,200
the Broadband companies will say well

557
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,559
John because they have deep voices John

558
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,840
how do you know we have Monopoly power

559
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,640
just because there's not that many we

560
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,159
still could be pricing competitively

561
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,679
well economists have developed a very

562
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,559
clever test fors Monopoly power which is

563
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,440
they ask what happens to prices as more

564
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,600
firms

565
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,440
enter if a Market's competitive what

566
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,520
should an additional firm entering do to

567
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,520
the price

568
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,600
no if a Market's perfectly competitive

569
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,520
what should additional firm entering doe

570
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,279
to the price if it's perfectly

571
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,000
competitive price is already set to

572
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,159
marginal cost it shouldn't do

573
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,320
anything price is already marginal cost

574
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
so additional firm shouldn't have a

575
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,960
meaningful effect on the price maybe go

576
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,120
down a little but not meaningful if it's

577
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,679
a monopoly market and you add a second

578
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,080
firm price will come down a lot and

579
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,440
we'll TR that next next

580
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,559
lecture so the way to test this is ask

581
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,400
what happens as more firms enter markets

582
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,080
do prices come down a little

583
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,799
or do they come down a

584
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:10,600
lot and the answer is it comes down a

585
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:13,679
lot so basically for every um for

586
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,000
gigabyte internet moving from one

587
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,279
provider to two providers of gigabyte

588
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,559
internet lowers the monthly price by 60

589
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,320
bucks a month literally you pay 60 bucks

590
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,720
less a month for gigabyte internet when

591
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,039
you get go from one provider to two

592
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,240
provider that is not a competitive

593
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,320
market

594
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,320
okay so obviously there are huge

595
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,039
Monopoly rents being made in these

596
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,600
markets so what could we do well the

597
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,480
answer is easy we regulate the

598
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,720
price we say look we're going to

599
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,440
regulate the price at a level you know

600
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,720
you can't regulate at truly marginal

601
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,520
cost because then no one will enter it's

602
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,360
the question I got before why would any

603
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,880
enter but you say look marginal costs

604
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
this is what we do for example with

605
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
electricity and water those are Public

606
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,159
Utilities the way we regulate we say

607
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,080
look you have an acceptable profit rate

608
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,520
will let you make 10% whatever it is and

609
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,760
regulate the price at the marginal cost

610
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,400
plus that profit rate you do the same

611
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,760
thing with Broadband we already do it we

612
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,159
electricity and water we have plenty of

613
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,320
electricity and water in the US why not

614
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,039
just do the same thing in Broadband

615
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,679
indeed that's what they do in

616
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,520
Europe in Europe they have quite an

617
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,799
interesting approach they they have a

618
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,600
different they regul the price but

619
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,919
actually they do a different kind of

620
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,159
regulation in Europe the public owns the

621
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,840
lines and the companies compete on

622
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,600
sending the signal over the lines

623
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,600
it's kind of a clever approach the fixed

624
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,960
cost part is laying the lines right the

625
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,039
marginal cost part is setting the signal

626
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,120
over the lines so the government owns

627
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,000
the lines and companies compete on who

628
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,480
sends the signals and Broadband if you

629
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,960
ever been to Europe is incredibly cheap

630
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,200
compared to

631
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,720
here okay that's when way to do it or

632
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,000
alternatively if we don't like that we

633
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,000
could just regulate the price so why

634
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,159
don't we just do that why don't we just

635
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,559
do what figure 122

636
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,120
suggest well the answer is because it

637
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,640
turns out to be hard because we don't

638
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,840
get these handouts in the real world

639
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,919
okay in the real world we have to figure

640
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,559
out what the competitive price is and

641
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,880
that turns out to be hard it turns out

642
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,400
to be hard because we need to know what

643
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,559
demand curves look like and what Supply

644
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,080
curves look like and both are hard to

645
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,600
measure let's start with demand

646
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,760
curves you might say look it's easy to

647
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,640
measure a demand curve just ask people

648
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,000
they're willing us to pay you say

649
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,880
literally I go and I do a survey of all

650
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,919
the customers are Bron band I say how

651
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,240
much you willing to pay for each of

652
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,480
these different

653
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,080
options for broadband and then I

654
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,440
regulate the price the problem is people

655
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,399
have no idea what it's worth to

656
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,840
them people don't know when you ask

657
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,640
people with stuff's Worth to them and it

658
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,760
is something they buy all the time they

659
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,720
don't know if you ask me what an Apple's

660
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,360
Worth to I say well I've gone to the

661
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,720
store and apple you know Apple cost

662
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,320
that's about 80 cents or a buck for an

663
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,880
apple you know for a good apple per

664
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,039
pound I can get a sense if you said

665
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,880
would you pay five bucks for an apple

666
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,559
I'd say no but I don't honestly know I

667
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,320
mean if you said would you pay $1,000 a

668
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:58,679
month for internet that's too much and

669
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,440
zero sounds cheap but 60 100 150 I I

670
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,159
have a harder time figuring out what's a

671
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,480
fair price okay this is obviously an

672
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,840
even bigger problem when you think not

673
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,039
just about regulating broad Bend but

674
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,880
they regulating things like the

675
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:14,520
environment regulating things like U

676
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,279
stopping oil spills or global warming so

677
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,559
for example if you ask people what

678
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,440
environmental benefits are worth they

679
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,720
have no idea so for example if you ask

680
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,919
people what it's worth to save the Grand

681
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,120
Canyon and you first ask as a standalone

682
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,919
question and then separately ask as one

683
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,000
of five questions in the second case

684
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,720
people give a value that's one as big

685
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,559
shouldn't matter right just your value

686
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,120
but the problem is they don't know um if

687
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,360
you ask people how much they'll pay to

688
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,360
save a whale and save a seal if you ask

689
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,760
them how they'll pay to to say a to save

690
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,240
a whale and save a seal they'll pay $172

691
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,960
to save a whale and $85 save a seal that

692
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,760
make sense Wells are bigger okay if you

693
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:01,960
ask the order reversed

694
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,240
and say that um how much save a seal and

695
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,919
how much save a whale people say they're

696
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,240
about worth the

697
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,640
same okay um if you ask people how much

698
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,240
they'll pay to save a thousand birds or

699
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,360
a million birds or a billion Birds they

700
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,840
give the same answer none of these

701
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,039
things are consistent with any form of

702
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,120
utility that we write down in this class

703
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,240
people clearly don't know so it's hard

704
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,640
to measure demand it's easy to measure

705
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,080
demand when there's a price signal when

706
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,320
you see different prices and you see

707
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,799
well want different prices but when you

708
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,080
try to create a new market and you have

709
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,600
to rely on willingness to pay that's

710
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,279
hard that's the first problem demand

711
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,679
curves are hard to draw the second

712
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,000
problem is Supply curves are hard now

713
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,039
you might say here well it's easy you

714
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,399
just go to the firm and you say well

715
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,399
give me your marginal

716
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:49,480
cost and that's great and what does the

717
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:51,880
firm

718
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,840
say when you say give me Marin cost they

719
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,840
say sure what do they give

720
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,080
you if you're running a firm what would

721
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,080
you do

722
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,039
yeah You' give them the biggest possible

723
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,000
margin cost you could ever justify in

724
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,000
the world remember my story about the SE

725
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
about the CEO wanted his own plane

726
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,640
that's nothing compared to this okay the

727
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,000
problem is you're trying to regulate an

728
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,600
industry that knows more about itself

729
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,840
than you do so it's hard to know what

730
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,279
Supply is

731
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,120
either so the problem with regulation is

732
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,840
that you're you can't just draw these

733
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:29,080
neat diagrams you have to guess at them

734
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:31,840
which is fine except if you get it wrong

735
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,559
you can make things worse take a look at

736
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,360
figure

737
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,440
123 imagine the government

738
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,000
decided that it was set the price at 10

739
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,519
it had some base setting theice it it

740
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,519
got its own demand curves Supply curves

741
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:45,600
it decided 10 was the competitive price

742
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,039
whereas we know the right competitive

743
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,519
price is 16 what happens this Market

744
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,840
sets the price at 10 well at a price of

745
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,880
10 the optimal Monopoly choice you

746
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,399
should solve this for yourself is to

747
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,279
produce five

748
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,000
units at a price of 10 well that creates

749
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,720
even bigger dead weight loss than if you

750
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,559
just let the Monopoly rip you've lost an

751
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,120
extra that extra shaded

752
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,440
area Okay from regulating the price at

753
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,600
10 so the government's made things worse

754
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,279
it could be even worse if you're at the

755
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,039
price low enough you could just kill the

756
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,320
industry the industry can say I'm not

757
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,840
going to form at all because the price

758
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,039
isn't is too low how would you know the

759
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,880
industry didn't exist how would you know

760
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,679
the regulations killed

761
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,000
it okay so

762
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,360
basically regulation is tricky there's a

763
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,279
recent research paper I learned about

764
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,600
where someone looked at what happened

765
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,039
when the Food and Drug Administration

766
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,559
which regulates medical devices loosened

767
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,360
the regulation categories of medical

768
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,880
devices you want the regular devices

769
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,720
right you want there to be sa you

770
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,720
worried about safety you want some

771
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,559
regulation when they loosen the

772
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,559
regulations they found Innovation went

773
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:51,120
up a th% and there was no worst safety

774
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,120
clearly they were overregulation

775
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,519
uh what the tradeoff is with government

776
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,240
intervention and this is sort of the

777
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:07,880
point of my entire course

778
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,279
1441 which is markets typically feature

779
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,840
market failure there's honestly truly

780
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,600
almost no Market in America doesn't

781
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,919
feature market failure of some type if

782
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,880
there's a market failure then in theory

783
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,679
the government can make it better in

784
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,799
practice it's not clear it

785
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,840
will so the fact there's market failure

786
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,720
does not

787
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,919
justify you saying there that a

788
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,679
government regulation it better it might

789
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,519
make it better it justifies considering

790
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,679
the government regulation but you still

791
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,360
don't know it makes it better until you

792
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:41,200
do the careful empirical

793
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,200
analysis okay questions about

794
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,960
that now let's say you're worried about

795
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:50,840
that and you're worried you say look I'm

796
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,679
really worried about regulating but

797
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,039
there's this Monopoly and it's consumers

798
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,080
are losing out and I don't know what to

799
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,840
do well there's another option

800
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,440
governments have which which is

801
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,559
governments rather than creating an

802
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,000
creating Monopoly in the way it does up

803
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,120
there governments can reduce Monopoly by

804
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,200
injecting competition into markets and

805
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,720
there's no better example of that than

806
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,960
the market for

807
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:21,200
Education take a look at figure uh

808
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,200
124 figure 124 is from my textbook it

809
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,440
shows educational

810
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,519
spending in Blue by each country per

811
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,799
student so the US is about

812
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,679
almost 12,000 per student the Czech

813
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,960
Republic is about less than 6,000 per

814
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,240
student in Orange it shows that

815
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,840
country's performance on an

816
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,799
international math

817
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:45,200
exam Czech Republic does better than the

818
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,919
US indeed the US despite spending by far

819
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
the most per capita on education it's

820
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,760
pretty mediocre in international

821
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,840
comparisons of Education

822
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:57,760
systems now there's lots of reasons that

823
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:00,480
could be but clearly our schools are not

824
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,639
uh getting it done are not

825
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,559
delivering return for the proper return

826
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:06,320
for our

827
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,480
dollar one solution to that is say well

828
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,519
part of the reason they're not is

829
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,639
because schools are monopolies how many

830
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,360
you went to public school how many you

831
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:15,399
went to most of you okay public schools

832
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,519
are

833
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:19,760
monopolies I live in lexingon my kids if

834
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,880
they want to go public high school go to

835
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,159
lexingon high school it's not like can

836
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,600
say I'd prefer you know to go to brain

837
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,279
tree high school instead I don't have

838
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,320
that choice I have no choice it's a

839
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:32,039
monopoly now in some cities it's not

840
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,519
quite right some cities do have a choice

841
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,600
of say Elementary School some of you may

842
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,159
have if you ever grew up you grew up in

843
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,159
Chicago or Cambridge or some cities

844
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,559
where you can choose your elementary

845
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:44,240
school but typically you can't choose

846
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:47,799
the choice is not a feature of um of uh

847
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,320
Public Schools so the idea is since the

848
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,880
fear is since we've created these

849
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,559
monopolies have we created inefficient

850
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,880
schools that not delivering proper

851
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,240
benefits cuz remember I said when

852
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,399
Monopoly they can make profits well if

853
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,720
it's a monopoly where you can't make

854
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:03,840
profits but there's no competition the

855
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,880
other way can come out is just not doing

856
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,760
a good not being efficient there's no

857
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,080
incentive to efficient if you a monopoly

858
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,159
we could set your

859
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,039
price then there's every incentive to be

860
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,200
efficient because every dollar

861
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,639
efficiency gains a dollar profits but

862
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,440
imagine your Monopoly that can't set

863
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:19,080
your

864
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,919
price why work so hard to be

865
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,039
efficient right what's the pressure on

866
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,320
you to do so why not have a slightly

867
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,200
easier life and that's the concerns

868
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,559
happen with schools so that's why

869
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,519
there's a big move introduce competition

870
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,279
into the US public school

871
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,320
system okay one way to do so as I said

872
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,720
some schools have introduced what we

873
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,519
call public school choice they've

874
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,919
allowed students to choose across public

875
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,360
schools and the dollars follow the

876
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,600
students so if you're a shitty

877
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,480
Elementary School and folks leave you

878
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,919
get less money so suddenly it matters

879
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,880
quality matters for how much money you

880
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:55,200
have to function and that's uh that's

881
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,679
one approach that's been tried generally

882
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,039
does not seem to show it has a huge

883
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,840
effect on student performance

884
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,519
the other approach that's been tried is

885
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,000
to set up alternatives to the

886
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,799
traditional public school and the most

887
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,480
popular those most well known as charter

888
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,480
schools did any goes guys go to Charter

889
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,279
School yeah there's uh charter schools

890
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,600
are essentially non-traditional

891
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,880
Alternatives that are publicly funded so

892
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,880
idea is you've got your Lex in high

893
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,440
school and you've got your you know

894
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,559
achievement Academy charter school and

895
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,919
that Charter School often they're

896
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,919
for-profit sometimes they're nonprofit

897
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,559
are essentially Place students can go

898
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,799
they're still funded by the public

899
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,200
sector but they are not abiding by the

900
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,039
same set of rules necessarily for

901
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
instance they don't have to hire

902
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,880
unionized teachers Etc and they provide

903
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,240
a competitive alternative and in fact

904
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,480
charter schools have been shown by my

905
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,600
colleagues here MIT who've done the

906
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,559
leading research in the world to be

907
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,480
generally a very effective alternative

908
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,880
to private to public schools that

909
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,559
students who go to Charter School when

910
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,200
you put in a charter school students do

911
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,799
better okay the competition is working

912
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,159
in the context of Education by having

913
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,320
these educational

914
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,960
Alternatives so here's the case and in

915
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,079
particular let me say in particular for

916
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,320
disadvantaged students the group that

917
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,000
benefits the most from charter schools

918
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,240
are minorities under and and low-income

919
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,520
students they benefit the most from

920
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,879
having this alternative so here's an

921
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,560
example of another way governments can

922
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,839
try to deal with Market power is by

923
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,200
introducing uh introducing

924
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,720
Alternatives so the bottom line is

925
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,359
governments have the bottom line is

926
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,560
monopolies

927
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,040
exist okay governments the fact they

928
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,800
exists creates deadweight loss in the

929
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,960
market in fact it's good that they exist

930
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,760
in many cases like Pharmaceuticals we

931
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,800
want patents but at the same time we

932
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,000
want to figure out the optimal way to

933
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,119
deliver

934
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,200
Innovation but minimize the loss to

935
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,560
Consumers government regulation is one

936
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,160
way to do that okay another way is by

937
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,440
increasing competition in the market

938
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,440
okay questions about

939
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,720
that okay let's come to the third point

940
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
I want to talk about which is an

941
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,800
important

942
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,480
concept that is sort of starts to lead

943
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,640
us towards a more subtle way of think

944
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,040
about marks we've thought about two

945
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,720
extremes we've thought about perfect

946
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,680
competition and Monopoly starting next

947
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,240
time we're going to start talking more

948
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,400
generally about oligopoly in between

949
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,079
cases one sort of Bridge to that is the

950
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,079
notion of what we call contestable

951
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,079
markets

952
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,839
contestable

953
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,280
markets a contestable market is one

954
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,800
where there is a monopoly Advantage but

955
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,720
it's not so

956
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,119
big it's sort of like a natural monopoly

957
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,920
but with a natural par isn't so large

958
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,000
with a sunfix costs they're pretty big

959
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,119
but they're not so big that someone

960
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,560
couldn't enter at some point point the

961
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,520
idea here is there will be a

962
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,680
monopoly but it won't make that much

963
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,000
money the idea is there'll be a monopoly

964
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,480
but if it tries to set price too high

965
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
then it will cover fixed cost and firms

966
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,520
will

967
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,720
enter so monopolies are sort of in a

968
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,760
contestable market monopolies have

969
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,640
barriers to entry but they're not so

970
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,240
big that they can go nuts and charge

971
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,119
full Monopoly

972
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,880
prices okay and the most famous example

973
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,119
of this was in the era of

974
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,280
Airlines when I was a

975
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,800
kid Airlines were a regulated

976
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,200
Monopoly if you want to fly from A to B

977
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,680
you had to apply to the government they

978
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,839
gave permission to supply from A to B

979
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,000
and they regulated the price you could

980
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:56,079
charge

981
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,720
okay and um in that World um basically

982
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,520
the view was governments kind of didn't

983
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,119
do a very good job and Airlines made a

984
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,520
lot of money the view is governments

985
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,920
because remember the airlines kind of

986
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,119
lie about their marginal cost and the

987
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,560
view was governments were sort of in

988
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,079
their pocket and the government was

989
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,480
setting prices too highs and making a

990
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,760
lot of money and Economist said you know

991
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,920
what you don't have to regulate this

992
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,400
industry yeah it's a natural monopoly

993
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,240
but it's also a very contestable Market

994
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,920
okay the fixed costs aren't that fixed

995
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,359
cost aren't that huge because there's

996
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,800
lots of planes for sale planes that are

997
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,920
a couple years old still work really

998
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,000
well and other airlines can buy them

999
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,160
this is actually not that hard industry

1000
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,839
to enter I mean it's hard I can't enter

1001
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,160
it but it takes you know tens of

1002
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,640
millions not billions to get into this

1003
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:45,560
industry so actually if we get rid of

1004
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,000
Regulation we can actually do better

1005
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,680
than if we keep regulation you're in a

1006
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,200
case where essentially you're setting

1007
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,240
the price so high that if you just let

1008
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,000
competition work will do better and

1009
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,760
economists actually won the day

1010
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,839
economist convinced the government to

1011
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,160
deregulate the airline

1012
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:10,200
industry so what happened three things

1013
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,880
first prices fell enormously economists

1014
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,560
were right prices fell by about a third

1015
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,960
the unregulated prices were about

1016
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,200
two-thirds of what the regulated prices

1017
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,359
were because economists were right the

1018
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,880
government had set the price too high an

1019
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,800
example is that when I was at MIT in the

1020
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,720
1980s I would fly home to Newark on

1021
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,319
people's Express People's Express which

1022
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,960
sounds like a communist organization was

1023
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:37,480
this new airline that was introduced in

1024
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,760
the new deregulated Market in 1984 the

1025
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,359
market had only been deregulated about a

1026
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,240
decade so so this new Airline and I

1027
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,240
would fly from Boston to New York for

1028
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,240
1999

1029
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,800
$19.99 okay I mean now it's a few

1030
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,319
hundred dollars right it was before that

1031
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,640
Airline also a couple hundred bucks

1032
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:57,000
literally didn't even reserve a spot you

1033
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,400
just literally showed up and lined up

1034
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,599
when the plane was full they took off I

1035
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,640
I don't know then they went they came

1036
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,839
through with the cart and you paid on

1037
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,200
the plane I don't know like if you

1038
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:08,240
didn't have money they throw you off I

1039
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:12,200
don't know but like literally it was so

1040
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,440
cheap to fly prices came way down from

1041
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,400
what they used to

1042
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,800
be the second is the number of routes

1043
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,280
that were

1044
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,599
flown went way

1045
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,240
up because it turns out there were lots

1046
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,560
of routes that were profitable to fly

1047
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,000
the government wouldn't let happen it

1048
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,359
turned out airlin say well look if you

1049
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,720
let me charge what I want I can figure

1050
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,040
out would make this route profitable so

1051
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,359
there's a huge increase in Access huge

1052
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,960
increase in where planes went at a much

1053
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,480
lower

1054
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,760
price third

1055
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,680
effect service

1056
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,800
quality

1057
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,560
tanked flying used to be fun when I was

1058
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,000
a kid everything was free you got in the

1059
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,760
plane free food free booze real

1060
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,520
silverware huge leg room no no charge

1061
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,040
for anything free bags okay any of you

1062
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,920
watch Mad Men and watch you know Don Don

1063
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,520
Draper fly that's what it's like he's

1064
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,440
not even flying business class in those

1065
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,880
shows it was awesome flying today sucks

1066
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,280
we all know

1067
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,960
that okay so why did that

1068
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,960
happen why did quality deteriorate so

1069
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,960
much but we deregulate Airlines why did

1070
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,119
quality fall so much yeah actually

1071
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,520
really funny because we're doing a

1072
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,920
project in another CL

1073
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,839
okay um long story short like in order

1074
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,680
to have such good customer service you

1075
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:37,680
have to through a lot of employees and

1076
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,440
so your TR is be really high as a result

1077
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,880
as soon as you start getting market

1078
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,880
share for like people's econom

1079
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,599
people Legacy

1080
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,480
carriers yeah I mean that's a little

1081
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,640
more detailed answer than I wanted but

1082
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:55,359
basically the bottom line is when you

1083
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,680
are regulated on

1084
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,680
price but you have different planes

1085
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,319
flying the same route how do they

1086
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,760
compete on quality right in a in the

1087
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,880
markets we've discussed so far the only

1088
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,720
way firms can compete is on price but

1089
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,680
firms compete in reality along multiple

1090
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,440
Dimensions so in the old days if United

1091
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,640
America were both flying to

1092
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,760
Chicago and they had to charge the same

1093
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,200
price how did they get your business by

1094
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,520
being a nicer

1095
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,319
experience now suddenly they can compete

1096
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,319
on price they said we're not going to be

1097
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,359
nicer experienc anymore it's too

1098
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,400
expensive we're just going to charge a

1099
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,839
lower price

1100
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,800
now you might say well gee that sucks

1101
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,520
that's a terrible thing it's horrible

1102
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,400
Airline quality fault why would I tell

1103
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,599
you you're wrong why would I tell you

1104
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,920
it's good that Airline quality fell why

1105
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,280
can I say for sure we're better in a

1106
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,440
world with lower prices and lower

1107
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,440
quality than we are than we are in a

1108
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,760
world with higher price and higher

1109
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,079
quality

1110
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,680
yeah well I I don't know that because

1111
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:54,119
only because I grew a draft in prices I

1112
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,000
didn't draw a draft in

1113
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,000
quality I don't know that we got rid of

1114
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,520
the Dead weight loss for sure

1115
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,920
but I do know something else what do I

1116
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,240
know what fact is true

1117
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,319
yeah what's

1118
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,839
that well it's more accessible we flying

1119
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,680
more routes but they're shitty how do I

1120
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:15,720
know people wouldn't

1121
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,400
rather do something else yeah you can

1122
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,839
still pay for a better experience so the

1123
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,720
fact that people are buying a cheaper

1124
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,280
ticket yeah because we haven't ruled out

1125
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,880
high quality high prices just no one

1126
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,400
wants it okay so people who bit

1127
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,079
about oh flying's terrible they don't

1128
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,599
 about the fact it's really cheap

1129
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,400
and if you don't like that fly business

1130
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,839
class or if you don't like that get

1131
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,119
together and form an airline that gives

1132
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,640
the old high quality high prices JetBlue

1133
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,920
sort of tried to do this JetBlue was

1134
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,319
kind of a better experience now that

1135
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,040
kind of deteriorated back towards what

1136
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:46,400
the airlines are when jebl started you

1137
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,880
get all these free snacks and stuff

1138
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,240
which no one was doing okay they were

1139
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,400
trying to do that a little bit but the

1140
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,280
bottom line is if you want to tell me

1141
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,640
gee the old world was better I tell you

1142
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,319
fine go back to the old world if it was

1143
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,440
better it should exist it doesn't

1144
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:02,559
because while people don't while people

1145
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,240
may about flying now they they

1146
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,760
aren't bitching about the prices and

1147
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,240
we're happier and this is the key

1148
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,520
concept once again of revealed

1149
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,280
preference this is how economists test

1150
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,720
welfare conclusions we use revealed

1151
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,040
preference we've revealed that we'd

1152
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,960
rather have low quality at low prices

1153
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,040
because it's rewarded in the market new

1154
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,119
lowcost airlines that suck enter all the

1155
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,040
time but high-end Airlines don't so we

1156
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,200
we want low quality at low prices I we

1157
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,040
i' rather have high quality at low

1158
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,480
prices but that's not an option okay

1159
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,920
that's the third thing that happened the

1160
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,079
fourth thing that happened actually five

1161
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,280
things happened the fourth thing that

1162
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,640
happened is that safety the other thing

1163
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,200
you'd be concerned about is well gee now

1164
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,040
there's no one said it to be safe but in

1165
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,280
fact it turns out safety didn't

1166
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,319
change it turns out there's still enough

1167
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,960
instead of to be safe that it wasn't

1168
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:57,440
like the regulation was actually making

1169
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,559
flying any safer flying is unbelievable

1170
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,240
safe it always was it always

1171
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,720
is so this is all great news Economist

1172
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,520
for the win except economists got one

1173
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,559
thing

1174
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,040
wrong we got one thing wrong which we

1175
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:16,160
missed the fact that while there's not

1176
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,319
huge barriers to entry in terms of

1177
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,160
airplanes there is huge barriers to

1178
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,400
entry in terms of what what's the

1179
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:27,720
barrier to entry yeah airport

1180
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,079
slots that those are fixed and that it's

1181
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,839
incredibly hard to expand an airport it

1182
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,760
took Logan airport until about 12 years

1183
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:37,839
ago had one Runway at night one runway

1184
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,119
in Boston at night think about that for

1185
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,280
the city of Boston we expanded to two it

1186
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:47,119
took 25 years to happen to expand a two

1187
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:50,440
runways okay it is very hard to add new

1188
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,119
airport slots as a result there is a

1189
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,559
truly fixed barrier which is Airline

1190
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,800
slots and as a result competition did

1191
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,200
not go up as much as we thought take

1192
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,599
Minnesota where I had to fly for years

1193
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,200
to visit my wife's family okay Minnesota

1194
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,680
was served almost as a monopoly by what

1195
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,720
was called Northwest Airlines in our

1196
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,640
part of

1197
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,720
Delta now why didn't the city of mota of

1198
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,720
Minneapolis and Northwest control all

1199
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,480
the slots at the airport why does it in

1200
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,760
Minneapolis say hey Northwest we're

1201
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,319
going to take a a few of your slots and

1202
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,400
allow another airline to come

1203
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:25,400
in and create some competition why

1204
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,280
because Northwest Airlines was

1205
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,480
headquartered in Minneapolis and said if

1206
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,800
you do that we'll leave and we'll take

1207
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,640
all our jobs with

1208
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,599
us and so essentially uh the city of

1209
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,800
this city of Minneapolis barely let any

1210
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,040
competition

1211
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,960
in as a result of this ability to sort

1212
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:46,640
of monopolize slots Airlines set up what

1213
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,640
we call the Hub and spoke

1214
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,760
system which is if you want to fly from

1215
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,760
A to B you got it on the way stop at C

1216
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,319
which is their headquarters

1217
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,640
airport okay so Airlines funneled all

1218
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,400
their traffic through airports where

1219
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,960
there're sort of

1220
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,720
monopolies and as a result while there's

1221
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,440
much more competition prices did come

1222
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,559
down a third there's much less than we

1223
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,359
thought there would

1224
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:15,559
be because we missed the fact that the

1225
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:18,880
airport slots are truly fixed and aren't

1226
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:21,599
expanding so there a great lesson in the

1227
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,200
power of Economics but even the creative

1228
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,839
economic aabus can't see the future

1229
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,040
industry is incredibly creative at

1230
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,000
maximizing its profits

1231
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,960
and that they will come up with things

1232
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,160
uh to get around almost any well meaning

1233
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,079
government intervention doesn't mean

1234
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,760
government interventions aren't a good

1235
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,680
thing to do doesn't mean we can't do

1236
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,400
more but it does mean we have to

1237
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,880
consider we think about projecting the

1238
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,000
effects of government interventions how

1239
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,760
industry will respond what we call the

1240
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,119
Dynamics we can't just say this is the

1241
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,359
way the industry works today so it'll

1242
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,000
always work that way we have to consider

1243
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:53,359
well what are the other angles how's the

1244
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,440
industry going to respond and that's

1245
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,960
once again a big challenge for

1246
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,240
government policy maker is envisioning

1247
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,800
worlds that might be under your

1248
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,800
regulatory environment not as it is

1249
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,800
today
