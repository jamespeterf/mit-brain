1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome everyone. Uh, it's my pleasure

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,920
to introduce our robotics seminar

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,719
speaker today, Professor Caitlyn Becker.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,160
Kate is an assistant professor at our

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,560
mechanical engineering department here

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,600
at MIT, uh, where she leads the

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,840
fabrication integrated design lab. She

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
works in the area of soft robotics with

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
a focus on creating gentle and adaptive

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,199
soft robots through new design and

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,880
fabrication methodologies. The soft

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,960
gripper that she has developed can

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,000
operate in the deep sea and it has been

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,800
deployed at a depth of 3.5 kilometer to

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,719
sample fragile ocean species. Her work

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,760
is quite popular. They are featured in

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,320
top journals such as PNAS uh advanced

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
functional material soft robotics etc.

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,559
and in particular has been featured in

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
the American Museum of Natural History.

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,600
Kate is a recipient of multiple awards

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,520
such as the Robosoft Rising Star award

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,879
and the Roose and Joe Spear teaching

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,119
award. Today uh Kate is going to talk to

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,680
us about mechanical programming of soft

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,360
robots via fabrication

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,200
uh integrated design. Um Kate, we look

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,520
forward to your talk. Floor is yours.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
>> Beautiful. Can everybody hear me? Okay.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
Wonderful. Uh well, thank you for the

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
introduction. Thank you every for

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
everybody for being here on a Friday

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,600
afternoon. I really appreciate it. I'm

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,040
excited to be here myself. Um so

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
just a little bit of context about me

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
before I start. Um you've heard a little

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
bit, but um I'm actually coming from the

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,799
Mechy department as an undergrad and I'm

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,479
a manufacturing and design engineer. So

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
I worked in medical device manufacturing

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,520
and then nanop fabrication before I then

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,680
joined Rob Wood's micro robotics lab. So

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
you'll see some of that color how I look

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
at soft robotics and navigate those

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,399
spaces. Um my lab actually has two

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,159
tracks in parallel. I'm only going to

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
talk about soft robots today, but we

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,799
also work on additive manufacturing with

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,479
molten glass. So both of those I see

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
sitting at the intersection of machine

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,360
design and manufacturing both using

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,720
unconventional materials. So squishy

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,840
robots and masonry made out of glass.

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,080
Um, I really couldn't have done the work

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,160
today without uh a lot of the students

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
in my lab. This isn't everybody that we

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
have and there's a few people on here

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
actually who have just graduated which

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
is bittersweet but it's a huge thanks to

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,160
them that were able to kind of show you

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,480
this today. Um, whether it's soft

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,519
robots, rigid systems or soft rigid

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,720
hybrids. So to explain a little bit

64
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,040
about what I was thinking of starting

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,200
with when I say what I mean by

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,760
mechanical programming. Um you could

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
interpret that as embodied intelligence.

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,239
You could inter uh interpret that as

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,800
intelligent mechanical design

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,160
potentially. But um here are three

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
examples of what I mean that are going

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,959
to show up a little bit later. And I

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,440
guess what I mean is to design a soft

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,959
robot you're affecting the form as a way

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,560
of getting function. And so in that way

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,840
you're mechanically programming it

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
through the structure and through the

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,040
fabrication process. So on the lefth

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,599
hand example um we have a gripper that

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,319
takes a single high low square wave and

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,640
converts that to a sequenced output

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,879
through kind of three integrated

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,120
actuators and a little valve. And then

84
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,599
in the middle section here, we've got a

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,159
gripper that upon inflation will coil

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,239
around that SE whip, but then is limited

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,799
specifically to not apply more than 2

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
psi of contact pressure. On the right

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,879
hand side, I have a robot that's

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
completely open loop, but the mechanical

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,120
programming comes in its compliant

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,879
structure so that it can adapt passively

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,319
to the objects that are picking it up.

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,680
So, I've both kind of mechanically

95
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,280
programmed it in the fabrication

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,480
process, but it's almost like I'm

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
mechanically programming a little bit

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,760
with the assistance of the objects that

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,239
we're picking up.

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
And then I suppose not everybody in the

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
room is a soft roboticist. So, I thought

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
I should motivate kind of why we care

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,439
about soft robots. And so, I'm going to

104
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,959
start with two applications that are

105
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,360
either motivating or near and dear to

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,120
me. And then I'm going to move to kind

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
of how we can't quite serve those

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,080
applications and how that's motivating

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
the rest of my talk. So, I would say um

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
for those for the general audience,

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Baymax is kind of the platonic ideal of

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
a soft robot. If you haven't seen Big

113
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,880
Hero 6 from Disney, it's very cute. I

114
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
recommend it. But essentially, it's a

115
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
big nurse robot that's very adaptive,

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
very capable, and resilient. And to me,

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
this kind of draws a parallel to the

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
first application of soft robotics that

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,120
caught my eye that interested me, which

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,199
is in uh assisted devices and

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
rehabilitation devices. I know, for

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,600
example, Professor Sada has done some

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,080
work in that area. Um, but thinking

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
about how we interact between soft

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,960
machines and organic soft machines,

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
there's a lot of complex motion in your

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,639
hands, that's difficult to create from

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,400
rigid systems. But if you have actuators

129
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
that are compliant, they can naturally

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
conform to a lot of variation in hands

131
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,639
and help patients that either need to

132
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,080
regain the ability to use their hands or

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,160
maybe to augment their limited strength.

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,960
So, I asked ChatGBT kind of what they

135
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,199
thought a assistive robot would look

136
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,479
like helping a physical therapist. And

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,000
believe it or not, it's less creepy than

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,800
what I came up with. Um, so in my

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,880
envisioning of assisting physical

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,240
therapists, I thought, ah, yes, I have

141
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
grippers and I will pick them up like

142
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
the squishy creatures in the sea. Um and

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,360
it will extend our touch so that when a

144
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,680
caregiver can't then reach their patient

145
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,800
they have this kind of extended virtual

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,320
but also physical touch. Um now working

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,400
with professor Sada and some uh key kind

148
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,160
of stakeholders we then realized that

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
okay much more acceptable would be if

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
we're side by side with patients um

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,639
whether that's remotely operated or

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,199
maybe kind of assisting physical

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,479
therapists in the same room. And so this

154
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
was from a visit to Spalding

155
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,600
Rehabilitation Hospital actually with

156
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
one of Professor Assatada's students.

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
This is Ravi. He's working with uh Dr.

158
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,320
Kathy Pila and going through some upper

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,960
extremity exercises that they might

160
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,759
habitually do. We then tried these back

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
in our lab. And so I have we have a

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
Sawyer robot applying a soft gripper to

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,080
Daniel who doesn't look super enthused

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,120
but at least not terrified.

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,440
Um, and I would say even just having the

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,759
payload to pick up an arm is sometimes a

167
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
big ask for a soft robot. And then what

168
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
I'll come back to is whether we can do

169
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
that reliably as well. On the flip side,

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,880
I actually focus more on deep sea

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,360
biological sampling, which is something

172
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,319
I started in my PhD with Rob Wood. and

173
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,000
to motivate kind of the criticality. I

174
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,560
think you can guess that we don't want

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,880
unreliable robots around people and we

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
don't want we want robots to be gentle

177
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,160
around people. But for some of these

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
deep sea creatures, well, all of them,

179
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
they're animals and if you stress them

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
out, it actually changes their DNA

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
expression. So, it's quite important

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
actually to be gentle when you're

183
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,840
picking them up. Even if you're later

184
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,840
going to stress them out bringing them

185
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,479
to the surface, you have to apply RNA

186
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,759
freeze while being gentle to them. In

187
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,599
addition to that, running one of those

188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
vessels is actually on the order of

189
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,840
$50,000 a day. I wouldn't be the only

190
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,800
researcher on the boat. But that means

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,639
that when we deploy a remote operated

192
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
vehicle with a squishy gripper like this

193
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,960
attached, it takes three hours to go

194
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
down to depth. Maybe we're at depth for

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,479
3 days. And if I pop a leak in one of

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,400
these, they're not going to turn the

197
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,840
boat around for me. I've lost probably

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,759
three days of testing at 50k a day and

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
I'm only really at sea for a week. So

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,080
that's a huge loss. and a necessity to

201
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,680
then be more reliable. Um, but what we

202
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,759
like about the robots though is if we

203
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
can get them to last at depth, they're

204
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
actually really able to be gentle while

205
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
withstanding thousands of pounds of

206
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,199
hydrostatic pressure. Also, the

207
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,120
corrosive salinity that often eats up a

208
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,120
lot of the more rigid uh prototypes.

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,639
So I would say I don't know if any how

210
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,400
many of you are familiar with the field

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,560
of soft robotics but it doesn't have the

212
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,960
reputation for being durable reliable or

213
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,319
strong and I would say that that's a

214
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,000
limitation of design and manufacturing

215
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,240
specifically I think we need to come up

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
with a framework for soft machine design

217
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,199
and manufacturing now in that process we

218
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
have centuries of work in traditional

219
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,400
rigid machine design that we should be

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
leveraging there's a lot of work in

221
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,160
what's compliant machine design that we

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,680
should be leveraging, but at some point

223
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
we should also kind of move away from

224
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,919
that. And if you look about at how we

225
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
build rigid robots,

226
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,840
well, translating that to soft robots,

227
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,120
you can't bolt,

228
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,719
glue, or weld parts together. You can,

229
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,479
but then you should anticipate some

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,200
delamination and failure. Okay. So the

231
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,800
other thing is the way we teach hardware

232
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
design at least in this campus as I

233
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,680
experienced was to start with rigid

234
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,360
materials and small deformations. But if

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,920
you're using compliant materials for

236
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,399
your robots, part of what you want is to

237
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
really emphasize large deformations as a

238
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,399
way to get interesting fun and useful

239
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,160
functionality. Okay, so you get your

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,560
engineers to say, "Great, big

241
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,720
deformation's good."

242
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,040
But then how do you actually move past

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,880
the point that in Solid Works or Fusion

244
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,160
360 that a lot of us use to design

245
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,200
robots, those tools are designed to

246
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,279
design rigid systems and fabricate rigid

247
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,839
systems. The primitives are based on

248
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,080
turning and milling.

249
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,959
So I think as we mature in this field,

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,959
we're at a point where to get to greater

251
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
impact accessibility and by

252
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
accessibility I mean like how many

253
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,760
people could actually have a software

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,360
robot operating in their home? How many

255
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,800
of those can you reliably make at scale

256
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
and how many of those would be

257
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,920
commercially viable to get there? Well,

258
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
one thing that we've been employing and

259
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,240
we need to do is geometric and material

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
optimization. And that's necessary but

261
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
not sufficient. I would say that soft

262
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
robots are also going to need soft

263
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
machine specific design and

264
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,800
manufacturing frameworks. I would also

265
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,399
argue if you integrate the two of those,

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,640
you get much more efficacy than if

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,040
you're doing more what we call design

268
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,880
for manufacturing traditionally where

269
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,640
you're more focused on taking a design

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,440
and then tweaking it for one

271
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
manufacturing method and then usually

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,600
focused on operational efficiency or

273
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
cost.

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,560
If you then do a cross-pollination of

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
the two, I think you can get a lot

276
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,519
further. This is honestly a kind of

277
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,880
communitywide effort, a

278
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,279
multi-disiplinary effort, but it's

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
something that my lab is pushing. And

280
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,800
with that, I'm going to go kind of

281
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,399
focusing this on kind of what

282
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,240
functionalities we want to start with

283
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,640
from deep sea biological sampling. I've

284
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
talked about them some already, but so

285
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,959
you know what this looks like.

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
Basically, I'm on a ship like this. This

287
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,600
is the Nautilus. That's Bob Ballard's

288
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,680
boat that operates two ROVs. one of

289
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,519
which is Hercules on the right here. And

290
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,279
then when I show you a video, that's

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,880
mostly going to be from this bubble cam.

292
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,040
So, a lot of times you only have one

293
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,920
camera that you're watching uh a view

294
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,480
through and you're using a titanium

295
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
craft arm like this. So, an example of

296
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
what this looks like, these are some

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,680
videos that Noah gave me uh when we were

298
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
asking for particularly challenging

299
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,839
grasps that they have to deal with. And

300
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
some of the things that they struggle

301
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,360
with is moving targets. You got to be

302
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,120
gentle to the moving targets. if you're

303
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,120
not gentle, they do stop moving.

304
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
And then these are really clear videos,

305
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
but a lot of times we struggle with

306
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,600
limited vision, whether it's shadows or

307
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,480
marine snow

308
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,920
and compliant and complex shapes. So, a

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
having a hard time figuring out kind of

310
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,959
what pose would be best, but also when

311
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
you grab something, a lot of times it

312
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,480
bends and or breaks apart and falls

313
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,760
through the gripper.

314
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,760
Not great when you're on live broadcast.

315
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,200
I'll save this one as a surprise for

316
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,160
later. Anyway, so uh with Kevin

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,480
Galloway, uh we deployed the first

318
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,480
insitue deep sea biological samples uh

319
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
sampling from soft robots. On the left

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
here, that's 300 meters underwater in

321
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
the Red Sea. And then on the right is

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,320
one of my later prototypes that's gone

323
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,160
down, as Kevin said, 3,500 meters and

324
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
has been on tour recently, but

325
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,160
previously in the American Museum of

326
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,320
Natural History. And so from the get-go,

327
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
we're fairly successful with soft robots

328
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,360
because they're compliant and can start

329
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,120
to adapt to some of these squishy

330
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,680
creatures. And so, of course, um, and I

331
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,920
think, uh, I didn't mention before, in

332
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
addition to being compliant, um, and

333
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,200
being able to withstand the hydrostatic

334
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,920
pressure. I didn't mention this, they're

335
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
inert to the salinity. And the fun part

336
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,040
about this is that we can actually use

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,200
salt water as our hydraulic fluid. So,

338
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600
if we spring a leak, we're just leaking

339
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
salt water back into the ocean.

340
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
And of course

341
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,279
the old adage goes if it ain't fixed if

342
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,880
it ain't broke you should definitely fix

343
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,279
it more. So how I will fix it more is

344
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
with fabrication integrated design first

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
tackling durability and reliability I

346
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,000
think as being kind of the most critical

347
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,399
and then adding some adaptiveness to the

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,240
contact and then sensing and control

349
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,720
towards reflexes. So we'll go in this

350
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,120
order starting with durability and

351
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,600
reliability. So Kevin and I came up with

352
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,639
a way of softcore monolithic molding.

353
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,760
And I have one of these squishy fingers

354
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,320
with me, I think. Yep. Um, and basically

355
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,800
by coming up with a molding method where

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
we can mold the entire thing as one

357
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,279
monolithic piece and eliminating seams,

358
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,200
we double the operating pressure. Going

359
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,680
further down the rabbit hole of the

360
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360
additive technology used specifically to

361
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
make the molds that we're molding with,

362
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
then we can double the operating

363
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,120
pressure again without changing the

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,360
geometry. So again, I said geometric

365
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
optimization necessary, but there's a

366
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,200
probabilistic occurrence of defects that

367
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,360
you need to take into account when doing

368
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,720
fabrication. If you do so, then what

369
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
we've been able to accomplish here is a

370
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,480
4x increase in operational pressure and

371
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
over an order of magnitude increase in

372
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
cycles to failure. The next thing we

373
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,880
worry about is then the manual errors

374
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,199
because that was kind of manual casting.

375
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,360
Let's then change that to a prototype

376
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,760
method that Michael came up with for

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,040
injection molding of soft robots. and

378
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
then you have a little bit more

379
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,040
reliability and repeatability of those

380
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,360
results. Now, if I were to say we have

381
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,160
to make all robots all monolithic all

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,839
the time, you should shoot me down. Um,

383
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,360
it's not possible. It's not worth your

384
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,519
time. At some point, you're going to

385
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
need some seams. And so, Charlotte's

386
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,160
been working on then better

387
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,399
understanding kind of what that design

388
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
and manufacturing space is. Now, a lot

389
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,800
of times people then ask me when I

390
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
mention this, oh, what's the best

391
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,839
option? What's the best substrate?

392
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
What's the best glue?

393
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,560
And as my manufacturing students could

394
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
tell you, I repeat frequently, well,

395
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,120
that's relative and context dependent.

396
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
But if you start looking at the failures

397
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
that you're getting, whether they're go

398
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,399
cohesive, adhesive, a combination, or

399
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,480
substrate failures, then you have a good

400
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,959
idea of kind of how to update your

401
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
design to improve your weakest link. But

402
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,440
that's frustrating if I say that you

403
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
have to build something in order to see

404
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
how it fails, in order to make it

405
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,959
better.

406
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,720
Charlotte has been working on a

407
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
framework to then talk about kind of

408
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,519
what our parameters are, our functional

409
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,199
requirements we should start with for

410
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,320
soft robotics because they're not

411
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,760
exactly what we're we should be using if

412
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
we port them directly from traditional

413
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,839
rigid machine design. So, we talk about

414
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
things like flexibility and toughness as

415
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,720
a starting point in selecting both your

416
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,399
substrate and the glue that you're going

417
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,240
to use and then the bonding method

418
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519
because it both matters what materials

419
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,360
you use and how you apply them. And just

420
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,720
as an anecdote of kind of I think one of

421
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,959
the misconceptions that we're working

422
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,519
against here is that you can go directly

423
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,639
from let's say elongation to failure as

424
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
one of the basic things that most

425
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,760
software botistes site. It's not

426
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,880
actually the most productive thing to

427
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,800
start with. It turns out then um it

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,199
doesn't kind of reveal what's

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,920
necessarily happening in that kind of

430
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,920
region of peeling and deformation or

431
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,279
sometimes we site maybe oh we'll use a

432
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,040
stiffer material and that'll be

433
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,199
stronger. That doesn't really correlate

434
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,880
to kind of how the failure modes then

435
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,800
propagate. What you could then start

436
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,759
doing with stiffer, softer materials is

437
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,519
deciding, would I like something that uh

438
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,839
fails slowly so that I can detect

439
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,680
failure and have time to respond or

440
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360
potentially maybe I'd rather have a

441
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,360
stronger bond to begin with, but then I

442
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,920
risk catastrophic failure. It's a

443
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,320
trade-off.

444
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Now, I did say I'm interested in soft

445
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,399
and rigid systems, not just fully soft

446
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
robots. And that's what Cat's working

447
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,519
on. and then applying applying a

448
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,920
industrial scale process called flocking

449
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
where you apply fibers to either rigid

450
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,560
or flexible surfaces. But you can also

451
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
do that now at a laboratory scale uh

452
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
method that cats developed. So

453
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,320
essentially we can take things like the

454
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,399
hubs that we would glue into soft robots

455
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
and just directly overmold them. So

456
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
maybe it saves us some time but it

457
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,880
actually expands the design space of how

458
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
we can start to then configure some of

459
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,639
these arrangements of soft rigid

460
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,120
assemblies and then putting in more

461
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,360
securely different sensors for example.

462
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
Um just as a side note this is largely

463
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
motivated by kind of observing uh soft

464
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,079
tissue that has floating rigid elements

465
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,639
in it such as uh soft coral scarites

466
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,360
or oicles from brittle stars. So what

467
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,039
we're doing is essentially not so much

468
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
working on the materials because I'm not

469
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,919
a material scientist, but we're taking a

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,439
trick that allows us to use the

471
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
traditional materials that we're already

472
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,520
that we already have at play and

473
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
increase the mechanical engagement of

474
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,400
them either with synthetic fibers or

475
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
with natural fibers.

476
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,280
Natural fibers work better, but they

477
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
don't tend to come in the form factor

478
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,439
mass-produced that you'd like that you

479
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,679
can get synthetic fibers with.

480
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,160
So to see what this looks like, we have

481
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,400
a short video

482
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,559
sped up of our laboratory scale version.

483
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
And then I do have if someone if you

484
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,120
want to come up later and see what this

485
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,840
looks like, you'll recognize it

486
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,840
immediately. It's on jewelry boxes and

487
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,039
then some car dashes and things, but

488
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,120
this is like $1 widget I got from Amazon

489
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,440
that has been flocked.

490
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,160
So we can leverage of what has already

491
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
been developed on an industrial scale. I

492
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,840
wanted to show this one in particular.

493
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
So, we don't just use this for rigid

494
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,880
parts. This is actually a flexible

495
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,559
sensor that we had a hard time

496
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
connecting to some of the soft

497
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,080
actuators.

498
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,799
By flocking one side and putting it in

499
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,039
the actuator,

500
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:19,320
then we reduce kind of the delamination

501
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,320
that was essentially instant previously.

502
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm not going to be able to find my

503
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,000
cursor between these, so I feel like I

504
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,000
should just not push it. So, you get to

505
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,480
sit through the calming view of

506
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
degassing the flocking. It does trap

507
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,240
air. So, you got a lot of fibers there.

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,240
Yeah, Sean,

509
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,760
>> please.

510
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,240
>> What was that?

511
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,240
>> Yeah. Thank you,

512
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
>> Barry.

513
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,960
How you is the blocking material chosen

514
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,080
in some way that guarantees bonding for

515
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,160
wide variety of substrings or what's is

516
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,679
there any secret material?

517
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,720
>> Yeah, I think absolutely. Oh, and here's

518
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,400
the um actuator with the sensor in it

519
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
just to show kind of when previously we

520
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
tried to attach these by lacing them on,

521
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
you get a lot of noise and shifting from

522
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
the actuator. And so now because it's

523
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
bonded in place, like a we're happy that

524
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
it's not delaminating, but b we have an

525
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
also a cleaner signal. Um Sean, the

526
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
short answer is we mostly only tested it

527
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
with dragon skin. And so I think you

528
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
would want to be mindful, especially

529
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
given Charlotte's results of what

530
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
materials you're using. Um but we didn't

531
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,080
go so far as that. Mostly just looking

532
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,320
at how an array of materials would work

533
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,600
with uh dragon skin.

534
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,559
>> What about the other end? Like for

535
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,840
example, this is a sensor some kind of

536
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,960
plastic substrate.

537
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,400
>> Totally. Yeah. So um like a cyanoacryal

538
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,799
for example would work really well in

539
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
that plastic substrate. Um, and so it's

540
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,400
basically you're just playing the game

541
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,080
of which thing fails first and see if

542
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
you can kind of chemically increase the

543
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,080
bond to that thing. And then between the

544
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,360
silicone and the fibers, you're mostly

545
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,400
depending on mechanical engagement.

546
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,360
>> Ah, talk my Norwegian speaking phone.

547
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,960
Sorry. Um, okay. That's all I've got for

548
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,559
you for kind of the hardcore mostly

549
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
focused on manufacturing. Now we start

550
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,039
to build in between manufacturing and

551
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
design. So the previous ones are in

552
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,880
previous topics are increasing our

553
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,960
design space but fabrication focused.

554
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,320
Now I'm kind of mixing between the two.

555
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,919
And to motivate and kind of um show you

556
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,400
again what the deep sea sampling looks

557
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,440
like I have this video of about 800

558
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,320
meters down of a deep sea crab.

559
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
And so again we have something that has

560
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
uh or sorry now you see the situation

561
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,600
where we have limited vision. So there's

562
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,440
a lot of marine snow floating around and

563
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,200
outcropping and some shadows.

564
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
It's a complex shape we're going after

565
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,960
that doesn't particularly want to be

566
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,880
picked up and you still need to be

567
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,320
gentle. So the idea is that this is a

568
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
fairly dumb robot. There's not a lot of

569
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,720
feedback, but it's mechanically

570
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,440
programmed to then be able to pivot the

571
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,039
fingers just enough around those legs

572
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
and then not apply so much pressure that

573
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,200
we might hurt the crab because I would

574
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,360
rather not pick it up on live broadcast

575
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
than pick it up and hurt it. Um, so

576
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,720
basically the ROV pilot can just reach

577
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,320
around blindly under that outcropping

578
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,880
and just kind of hit go when you're in

579
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,480
the vicinity of the crab.

580
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,120
And the way we started this was I asked

581
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,200
the marine biologists what uh surrogate

582
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,799
we could use for testing. And push comes

583
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,240
a shove, we got them to say pretzel

584
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:25,840
sticks. Okay, I didn't succeed in

585
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,840
closing around pretzel sticks, but with

586
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,080
the same baseline actuator, adding some

587
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,080
strain limiting elements and then some

588
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
to then restrict the radial expansion

589
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,159
and force more of that deformation kind

590
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,840
of around the pretzel rod and then

591
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,280
actually adding some open cell foam to

592
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,120
close the rest of the gap and further

593
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,520
reduce the stress concentration. we get

594
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,440
to the point where we can hold something

595
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,760
anywhere from a half an inch up to

596
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,520
around like three or four inches and

597
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,280
then ensure that it's strong enough and

598
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,120
we have a low enough contact pressure as

599
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,200
we measure from this kind of contact

600
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,679
sensor array.

601
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,600
Now, taking this idea of kind of what I

602
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,360
did manually of kind of futing around

603
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,360
blindly, we said, well, wouldn't it be

604
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,240
nice if we could more intelligently

605
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,000
optimize based on a particular task?

606
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,840
This slide is a lot to look at, but I'm

607
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,240
going to walk through it. Um,

608
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,159
essentially Annie who's in the decode

609
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,480
lab and also in fiddle started with me

610
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,039
in Harvard on this project of creating a

611
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,640
tool for designing that is aware of the

612
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,200
manufacturing process and gives you

613
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,600
control over different objectives. In

614
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
particular, I was it was very important

615
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,520
to me that we started looking at a

616
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,840
larger nuanced variety of objectives.

617
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,240
So, not saying I would like my actuator

618
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,840
to bend at the lowest pressure possible

619
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,000
because that would give me a very weak

620
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,280
gripper, but starting to incorporate

621
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,960
things like the bandwidth and the max

622
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,880
strain or the force at a particular

623
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,880
level of closure as well as being able

624
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
to tailor the operating pressure for a

625
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
specific level of closure in

626
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
anticipation of what we're going to pick

627
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
up. Okay. And then you'll see some of

628
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
those come in. Ly, did you have a

629
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,080
question?

630
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,720
>> Yeah, I did. I noticed on the last slide

631
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,919
you had um you're actuating with

632
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
something like one and a quarter

633
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,559
atmospheresish.

634
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,200
>> Yeah.

635
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,080
>> Is that right? And you're trying to hold

636
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,520
yourself to a very low external contact

637
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
pressure.

638
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,039
>> Yeah.

639
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,799
>> So I I haven't done the math, but 2 PSI

640
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,640
is not

641
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,480
>> No. Some of it is So some of the trick

642
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,000
there is both kind of compliance in the

643
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
overall structure. So it's a pressurized

644
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,919
vessel. It's a relatively thin skin and

645
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
has those bellows that are also

646
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,400
flexible, but then also adding the

647
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,400
nonlinear stress strain response of the

648
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,799
foam is quite helpful. So, it basically

649
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,360
acts as like a capacitor and between I

650
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,600
think it's like 10% and 50 or 60%

651
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,280
compression, you can use the foam also

652
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,159
as a buffer to limit the contact

653
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,640
pressure.

654
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,360
>> Okay. So, so do you have a sort of noise

655
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,280
floor challenge with

656
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,320
>> the required actuation pressure versus

657
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,320
the external uh do you have a good sense

658
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,480
of where that floor is?

659
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,919
>> Uh, no. I have to get back to that. We

660
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,240
could probably dig it out of Annie's

661
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
results, but I would say no. But we do

662
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,760
have then control to be able to kind of

663
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,840
modulate those. There's a limit

664
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
obviously as you're suggesting um but

665
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,240
you have some ability to control that.

666
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,919
And um it can also relate to you can

667
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
start playing with the cross-sectional

668
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,320
area over like which that's uh applied

669
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,200
and the compliance of um the bellow side

670
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,200
of the structure.

671
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,440
Okay. So you'll see some of these come

672
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,360
back up again as far as u for example

673
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,000
bandwidth or the volume of actuation um

674
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,600
in particular to optimize for. But we

675
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,600
started out saying, "Okay, well, we'd

676
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,679
like a durable and strong gripper." Um,

677
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,039
and we parameterize the space just for

678
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
these bellow actuators. So, it's a

679
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,840
little bit limited, but given kind of

680
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
the prevalence of those as an archetype

681
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,120
within soft robotics, a really nice

682
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,320
place to start. And then we can do we

683
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,760
can start with the naive thing of a

684
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,039
parameter sweep, which probably doesn't

685
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
sound interesting to a lot of people who

686
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,080
are in optimization, but for me as a

687
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
designer, that's my bread and butter. I

688
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,080
would like to understand the sensitivity

689
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,760
of each individual variable and how that

690
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,200
then affects the performance so that I

691
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,440
can do that trade-off from the design

692
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
and manufacturing standpoint. But from

693
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,679
there, we can then dig into a grid

694
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,200
search or an evolutionary search with a

695
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,200
couple objectives in mind if we have

696
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,600
clearly defined functional requirements

697
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
for our task. And so for most users,

698
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,039
it's not particularly helpful to look at

699
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,000
a grid search and kind of a large array

700
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,919
of these kind of inner connections of

701
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,600
parameters. But for someone like me,

702
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,120
it's actually really nice to then start

703
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,159
playing and poking around in there and

704
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,960
see how that relates to the

705
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,400
manufacturing space. And so finally, u

706
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,640
basically what Annie's done is then

707
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,440
taken a Python controller that then

708
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,200
feeds these models into Abacus to do the

709
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,159
simulation and then navigates kind of

710
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,559
where we go to get an optimal design or

711
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,960
when we've uh converge and are close

712
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,919
enough, we essentially then export the

713
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,600
core of that. And the mold generation is

714
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
not automated yet. that's manual

715
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
currently but certainly could be

716
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,240
automated.

717
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,240
And then sorry going from here I've been

718
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,159
talking about essentially the underlying

719
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,240
structure optimization but then you can

720
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,240
also start to add some adaptivity in the

721
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,640
surface structures. So I'll just be very

722
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
quick with this one. Essentially um a

723
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,679
lot of these silicones are really high

724
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,760
friction. So to get a little bit more

725
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,039
dexterity you can then add elements to

726
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,000
be able to turn that friction in your

727
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,840
fingertips on and off. So by having a

728
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
constrained

729
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,159
high friction elastoic membrane that's

730
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,919
hidden behind a perforated low friction

731
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,240
membrane, I'm essentially just turning

732
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,400
friction on and off by pressurizing that

733
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,159
internal membrane. The pressure in the

734
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,600
fingers stays the same the whole time.

735
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
Pressure goes on and off like little

736
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,760
friction polyps popping out of the

737
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,360
fingertips. Okay, so between Annie's

738
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,400
optimization and then playing with

739
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,679
dexterity via friction,

740
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
this is all assuming that I have a

741
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,760
pretty good idea of what I'm going to

742
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,799
pick up and where I want to place my

743
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,159
stubby robot fingers. Now, sometimes

744
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,799
though, the things that I want to pick

745
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,279
up, I don't know what it's going to be.

746
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,919
So, often times the months leading up to

747
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,000
a trip, I have no idea what I'm going to

748
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,320
see. And then even once I'm on the boat

749
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
looking at something, A, I'm not sure

750
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,559
what it's going to do when I close the

751
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,159
claw, and B, even if I did close one of

752
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,400
these grippers over it, it's still not a

753
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,880
great fit with that topological or that

754
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,880
geometric complexity.

755
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,840
Thankfully, this one didn't go crunch,

756
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,080
but neither these soft robotic fingers

757
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,799
nor these rigid grippers are really well

758
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
suited for this. So, this is what kind

759
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,120
of gave me the idea. Well, all right.

760
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,039
We're trying to take this thing that we

761
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,960
love about soft robots, their

762
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,480
compliance,

763
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
but it's also kind of annoying because

764
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
the compliance means that they're less

765
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,240
predictable, harder to kind of carefully

766
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,480
arrange on an object. What if instead of

767
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,039
trying to make soft robots more easily

768
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,279
controlled, we just give up control and

769
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,679
instead go with a stochcastic approach?

770
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,919
So by adding

771
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,320
structural compliance to the material

772
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,600
compliance essentially we can passively

773
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,520
adapt to different objects. So some of

774
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,399
the mechanical programming is in making

775
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,240
them very high aspect ratio and then the

776
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,360
other is by letting them directly

777
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,039
interact with these objects.

778
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,440
Just to show you that this is indeed

779
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,200
stochastic. I have six grasps that are

780
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,640
overlaid.

781
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,399
They'll all look different but the

782
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,720
trajectory is generally the same. This

783
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,960
is not a precision operation, but it

784
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,360
deals with imprecision in the starting

785
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,799
point fairly well. And when I'm aiming

786
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,720
for a big bio box, my end precision is

787
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,240
less sensitive. And so, like I said

788
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
here, we can actually deal with a fair

789
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,240
amount of error and still retrieve an

790
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,600
object.

791
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,520
Okay. So, the gripper that I'm showing

792
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,159
you is mostly 12 filament, what I call

793
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,440
entanglement gripper. And this is dip

794
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,919
molded. So essentially, I can make large

795
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,320
arrays of very repeatable filament

796
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,799
actuators with very cheap molds because

797
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,880
I'm just leveraging surface tension and

798
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,600
gravity and viscosity to mechanically

799
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,480
program them.

800
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,960
So that gives me essentially similar to

801
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,320
making balloons or dipping candlesticks,

802
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,039
a very even film thickness. And an even

803
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,279
film thickness is boring. It needs some

804
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,880
mechanical programming. Ways that I

805
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,440
mechanically program this are through

806
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,919
gravity, fiber inclusions, electric

807
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,440
fields, and surface tension. Not really

808
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,120
going to get into the weeds, but I'll

809
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
tell you that that gives me control over

810
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559
the direction of motion, the operational

811
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,520
pressure, the curvature, and the grip

812
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,880
force. And I won't dig through the

813
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,039
results, but just show you that kind of

814
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,360
this is how I map then how a

815
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,760
manufacturing recipe then gives me a

816
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,559
path towards a particular performance

817
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,480
metric. And then I can start to

818
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,159
incorporate those into larger arrays. So

819
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
in the top we have a gravity programmed

820
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,840
array. It's 16 x 16. They all bend in

821
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,960
one direction because that's what

822
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,960
gravity does. And then the bottom array

823
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,480
is then programmed by fiber inclusions.

824
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,279
So then I can actually have an arbitrary

825
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,360
vector field there.

826
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,919
As we then make those longer, you can

827
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,159
see how they could start to interact

828
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,399
with objects in different ways. Though

829
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
the trajectory is the same. kind of move

830
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,159
the filaments over the object, turn the

831
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,640
pressure on, turn the pressure off.

832
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,080
Basically, it's an eccentric balloon,

833
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,279
thicker on one side than the other. When

834
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,600
you inflate it, the thinner side

835
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
inflates more, it buckles, it curls, and

836
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,240
they start interacting with each other

837
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,520
and the objects. And again, the objects

838
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,679
then define the shape of the gripper. We

839
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,200
can characterize this digitally by

840
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,200
taking a CT scan,

841
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,840
then turn that into kind of a digital

842
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,520
recreation of the filaments. And there's

843
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,960
a lot of nice ways that we can quantify

844
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,559
the level of entanglement that I'm going

845
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,480
to skip today, but I'll at least show

846
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,520
you then how we're able to map the

847
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,120
contacts. The contacts between grippers

848
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,120
or sorry, between filaments in addition

849
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,880
to the contacts from filament to object

850
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,679
are particularly important. That's how

851
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,159
we get a grasp that is greater than the

852
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,000
sum of its parts. And so I'll bring

853
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,440
these contacts back up later because

854
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,080
they give us an idea for a different

855
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,000
sensing modality. Um, but I'll just

856
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,600
mention that with a collaboration with

857
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,679
the Mahadavon Lab and using a

858
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,679
modification of Gaza's um,

859
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,000
uh, software, we're able to do kind of a

860
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,360
sweep of the different prototypes so

861
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
that, you know, we can do some spot

862
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,559
checks physically, but get a better

863
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,440
sense or a greater sense of what the

864
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,919
design and manufacturing spaces are.

865
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,120
Okay. So, at this point, everything I've

866
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,000
shown you is open loop. I want to start

867
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,480
building in sensing or first control. So

868
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,679
we have ability to kind of um have a

869
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,960
little bit more finite control over

870
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,480
where we're actuating different

871
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,799
actuators especially as we move to

872
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,080
larger arrays and then build in sensing

873
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,159
to then build up to reflexes.

874
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,679
So in the top and the right here I have

875
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,600
a large array that's just all actuated

876
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,080
from one manifold. Not particularly

877
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,440
complex, not that interesting. I can

878
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,760
start to kind of segment arrays um like

879
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,159
the 16x6 array below. Each of the

880
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,440
columns is actually fed to one channel.

881
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,919
But that means that I need to have a

882
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,799
tube for every single channel and that

883
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,200
results in a lot of tubing. So then

884
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:15,039
inspired by some work that I collabored

885
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,120
on um with Dr. Nicholas Bartlett where

886
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,360
we put together a mashup of the dip

887
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,519
molding process and micrfluidics to make

888
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,039
a demultiplexer that essentially could

889
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,840
take a small number of inputs and make

890
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,200
it into a larger number of outputs. Then

891
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,679
we get to something that has a little

892
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,640
bit higher throughput as far as like flu

893
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,880
fluid flow that Chief came up with. Now

894
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,480
this takes a couple different sources of

895
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,240
influence. We take the results from

896
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,360
Annie's optimization show us that the

897
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,720
inside of these actuators the dimensions

898
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,640
inside of here are actually quite

899
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,200
critical when we start looking at the

900
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,840
bandwidth the volume to actuation and

901
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,000
also the max strain in an actuator. So

902
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,880
by then switching to these really low

903
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,880
profile, we call them low volume cores,

904
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
we're able to increase the bandwidth,

905
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
decrease the volume actuation. Obviously

906
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,880
those are tied, but then also decrease

907
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,120
the overall strain,

908
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,120
which then in this case comparing one of

909
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,360
these to a traditional gripper, we can

910
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,559
get uh on average two orders of

911
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,720
magnitude increase in cycles to failure.

912
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,880
uh but in addition to that we can start

913
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,799
harnessing that extra design space to

914
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,799
make more complex structures that can

915
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,960
then convert simple signals into more

916
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,840
complex motion. So a single square wave

917
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,880
gets turned into a sequenced uh action

918
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,279
of then manipulating a pen and embodied

919
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,799
intelligence that like this is not new

920
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,799
in the field of soft robotics but what

921
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,559
is is being able to do that in oneot

922
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,480
monolithic molding so that you have a

923
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,200
more reliable and durable device. In

924
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,039
addition to that, by putting in these

925
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,120
really slender

926
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,679
uh low volume cores, so this is an

927
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,679
example of our check valve core, then we

928
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,440
can get to greater compact complexity.

929
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,760
And another nice thing is, you know, we

930
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,279
could do this with

931
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,960
fancier printers. Um, but really this

932
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,000
demonstration, which we're demolding in

933
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,679
the video, is essentially just a hobby

934
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,639
scale FFF printer and a $100 vinyl

935
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,639
cutter, Cricut cutter. So, Chief and I

936
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,320
are actually going to then take this

937
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,320
down the road to a local high school

938
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,639
that actually Michael Bell and I, who's

939
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,040
in the audience, taught at previously,

940
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,720
taking the Harvard software toolkit,

941
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,320
teaching students there. It was a mess.

942
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,839
It was difficult to get actuators,

943
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,000
successful actuators out in the first

944
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,679
few days. And then with this process,

945
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,440
I'm very confident that on the first

946
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,919
day, we're going to have functional

947
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,320
actuators.

948
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,960
Okay. So, in addition to this kind of

949
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,320
lowprofile internal geometry for a

950
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,839
single actuator, then we can build in

951
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,599
multiple degrees of freedom into one

952
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,599
actuator. So, we have four degrees of

953
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,440
freedom in this finger instead of one.

954
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,200
Now, we tried to put two degrees of

955
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,919
freedom in one of these and take it to

956
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,160
C, and it popped. So, we glued one of

957
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,920
the chambers and limped along. Remember

958
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,599
how painful I said it was if we miss a

959
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,359
day? That was a sad day. Okay, so Chvang

960
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,920
has made it so that we can now reliably

961
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,599
have many more degrees of freedom.

962
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,079
Whether it's four degrees of freedom in

963
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,320
this one kind of linear bending actuator

964
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,960
or then six degrees of freedom in this

965
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,599
spherical gripper, we then can put check

966
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,480
valves in. We can put uh pinch valves or

967
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,480
proportional valves in. Um, and I've

968
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,320
cleaned out a lot of the beautiful plots

969
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,920
that Jivang has to make the uh view a

970
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
little bit simpler for you all, but

971
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,079
trust me, he's gone through all the

972
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,680
different uh parameters and geometric

973
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,240
kind of parameters of this to be able to

974
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,040
see how it affects the output. So, for

975
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,960
example, this is for a static geometric

976
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,680
output. We're just changing the pinch

977
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,920
pressure to adjust flow. Seems pretty

978
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,880
obvious. And the hold pressure. Um but

979
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,599
then with the check valves an example is

980
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,720
changing the height of this uh core then

981
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,040
gives us an ability to change the flow

982
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,560
or the diadeicity of the valve being a

983
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,960
measure of kind of how directional that

984
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,800
flow is and how successfully it performs

985
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,480
as a check valve. Okay. But then

986
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,040
so we have this control but I really

987
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,520
just want to go back to high bandwidth

988
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,440
low volume of actuation that becomes

989
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,680
really helpful when we start designing

990
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:25,040
for untethered operations. So we have um

991
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,560
Sam's monopropellant engine which is

992
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,400
kind of miniaturaturized and fits in the

993
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,720
base of an actuator. It's essentially

994
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,079
using hydrogen peroxide when then

995
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:38,000
exposed to silver. This is the catalyst

996
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,839
in this case. then decomposes into just

997
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,400
steam and oxygen and can power our

998
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,800
actuators.

999
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,200
But then we of course care how much fuel

1000
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,960
that we have to consume. Um now this is

1001
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
not in the line of the manufacturing so

1002
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,880
much as I just want to note the really

1003
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,680
clever design that Sam came up with. He

1004
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,000
incorporated a compliant bladder inside

1005
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,640
of the engine that divides the engine

1006
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,640
and the actuator is essentially like the

1007
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,800
designs for deep sea pumps. What it does

1008
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,800
is it automatically resets gauge

1009
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
pressure of the engine to the internal

1010
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,520
pressure of the actuator which then

1011
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,960
helps to feed the forward reaction. So

1012
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,400
traditionally you'd have a central fuel

1013
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,119
tank pushing fuel into a fuel reactor

1014
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,200
that reacts. It powers the actuator. You

1015
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,680
need a higher central fuel tank pressure

1016
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,000
than your reactor. But with a bladder,

1017
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,720
you can have a low pressure in your

1018
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,280
central fuel tank that then flows and

1019
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,760
recharges the engine, pressurizes the

1020
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,760
bladder, that then starts to push fuel

1021
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,240
through the reactor, which then

1022
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,920
increases the pressure in the actuator.

1023
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,839
When it increases pressure in the

1024
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,240
actuator, it then pushes on that

1025
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,359
bladder. And because I have a one-way

1026
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,520
valve here, then it's continuing to push

1027
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,440
that reaction so that we can actually

1028
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,640
get to a higher pressure than you would

1029
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,320
otherwise with a traditional set of uh

1030
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,760
engine architecture. If that was

1031
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
confusing, that's fine. I'm going to

1032
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,440
keep going and you're welcome to ask me

1033
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,200
about it later. But what that lets us do

1034
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,480
is have a really fast reaction time

1035
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,280
because we have this miniaturaturized

1036
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,640
engine that's then normalized to the or

1037
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,320
adjusted to the gauge pressure of the

1038
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,320
actuator and then fuel is delivered

1039
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,839
directly to the base of that uh

1040
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,440
actuator.

1041
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,359
So in this demonstration, Sam's going to

1042
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,640
push a switch that turns the LED on just

1043
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,520
to show you that the switch has been

1044
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,359
pushed and then you can see the reaction

1045
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,800
time of the gripper. So this is a

1046
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,440
combination of both the efficiency of

1047
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,240
the engine design but then also the LVC

1048
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,480
gripper having a relatively low volume

1049
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,960
to actuation and thus higher bandwidth.

1050
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,880
>> Yeah.

1051
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,320
>> How adabatic do you need the u gripper

1052
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,160
to be if you're driving steel?

1053
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,200
>> Um

1054
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,119
it's fairly I mean I think

1055
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,359
>> if anything it might Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1056
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,480
Um, I think it long term we might

1057
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,920
actually have an issue where we need to

1058
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,400
draw heat out faster. Um, where I think

1059
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,560
you you can get to the point where some

1060
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,520
of your efficiency as far as like the

1061
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,000
percentage of fuel reacted is limited by

1062
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,440
keeping a low enough pressure that you

1063
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,119
actually have enough dwell time and you

1064
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,760
don't get this light and frost effect on

1065
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,240
the catalyst itself and thus pushing

1066
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,160
unreacted fuel through if that makes

1067
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,680
sense but happy to discuss it more

1068
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,680
after.

1069
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,800
Cool. So the other thing that we can do

1070
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,240
from this um in having a miniaturized

1071
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,800
engine which hopefully we will

1072
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,839
miniaturaturize more um so we have a

1073
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,839
really light uh or compact engine

1074
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,800
relatively small payload. So we actually

1075
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,119
load it onto a drone. In this case I've

1076
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,880
moved the LVC actuators or I haven't but

1077
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,160
Sam and Chiang have and they've replaced

1078
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,160
them with some of the entanglement

1079
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,160
grippers.

1080
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,400
So fully untethered

1081
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,560
and then those grippers are compliant

1082
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,040
enough you can just land without

1083
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,440
worrying about crunching something or

1084
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,520
knocking your drone over.

1085
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,960
We're still in this section but now I'm

1086
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,440
transitioning to sensing. So we have

1087
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,079
some ability to modulate control. Now we

1088
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,599
build in sensors for the feedback. Um

1089
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,680
trying to do so mindfully from a

1090
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,560
manufacturing perspective. So I'll start

1091
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,079
with uh Nah's work which is essentially

1092
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,560
starting out with this small array of

1093
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,119
three celiaike actuators but the idea is

1094
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,000
that it's a test bed for then

1095
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,440
controlling larger arrays without then

1096
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,280
making the cost of fabrication or the

1097
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,400
complexity of fabrication unbearable. So

1098
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
what we've done is try to take a

1099
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,760
relatively few number of sensors. So we

1100
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,599
have the pressure sensor that's

1101
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,640
controlling the or looking at the whole

1102
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,960
thing and then three photo resistors

1103
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,720
under one under each psyllium and then

1104
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,640
three resistive sensors. They're cracked

1105
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,400
graphite custom sensors that give us

1106
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,040
some ability to sense kind of

1107
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,920
directional motion. But we get a more

1108
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,599
rich kind of mapping of propriceptive

1109
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,400
and exterceptive

1110
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,839
uh feedback by looking at like using

1111
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,280
that redundancy and looking at the

1112
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,119
clashing between the signals that we're

1113
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,800
getting to then figure out what's going

1114
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,440
on.

1115
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,560
So the idea is that eventually we can

1116
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,480
move this into larger arrays

1117
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,000
and again just starting with basically

1118
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,160
two uh resist resistance sensors per

1119
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,839
psyllium and then one global pressure

1120
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,440
sensor.

1121
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,200
That's what this looks like. Um and

1122
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,760
something to note is that the cracked

1123
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,560
graphite sensor does meaningfully affect

1124
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,520
the kind of structure and the mechanical

1125
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,200
behavior of that actuator. So the next

1126
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,160
thing we thought about is is there a way

1127
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,800
that we can actually make this

1128
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,400
mechanically transparent. So in this

1129
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,560
case we used it strategically and used

1130
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,520
the sensor itself to then guide the

1131
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,960
curvature. But then Via in the lab was

1132
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,599
an undergrad in the lab who graduated

1133
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,560
recently and essentially added ears or a

1134
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,319
microphone to the entanglement gripper.

1135
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,640
So we have a microphone mounted kind of

1136
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,560
up near the top.

1137
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,640
And remember I talked about those

1138
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,560
connection points. Basically, we think

1139
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,400
about kind of where the filaments start

1140
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,680
touching each other that changes the

1141
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,839
natural frequencies at which they'll

1142
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,160
vibrate. Now, we started with a speaker

1143
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,720
on the entanglement gripper, and that

1144
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,000
was both annoying and unnecessary

1145
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,480
because you can actually just use

1146
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,880
ambient noise as your signal or your

1147
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,720
input signal. And then look at how this

1148
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,520
peak, for example, from electrical noise

1149
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,839
then shifts based on, for example, the

1150
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,200
actuation pressure or the weight of an

1151
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,599
object or the shape of an object. you

1152
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,319
can actually start to hear shape of

1153
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,240
objects based on how the contacts are

1154
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,200
distributed presumably between the

1155
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,319
filaments and the object. Um, so VIA

1156
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,000
essentially created I think this is a

1157
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,760
four they're four centimeter cubes.

1158
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,160
They're all the same or they fit within

1159
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,160
this 4cimeter cube. All the same weight

1160
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,359
but then different spatial densities so

1161
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,880
that we couldn't because we knew we

1162
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,000
could detest detect weight and so we

1163
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,599
wanted to make sure we were detecting

1164
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,800
shape and not weight if that makes

1165
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,560
sense. And I would say it wasn't a

1166
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,319
perfect result, but I'm pretty excited

1167
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,560
about initial results about being able

1168
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,160
to essentially hear something about the

1169
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,280
shapes that we're picking up more than

1170
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,800
just ah yes, we have something.

1171
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,160
Okay. But then if we want even more

1172
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,480
information, reviving kind of a um

1173
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,760
project that I did with Dr. Clark Tel at

1174
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,880
Harvard and now Chief has expanded this

1175
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,119
here in making arrays of optical fibers

1176
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,880
within a soft sheet as a way to both

1177
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,480
detect deformation and pressure. And so

1178
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,040
the idea in putting this in a soft sheet

1179
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,800
is well we could customize that to a

1180
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,400
particular geometry and I think that's

1181
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,400
an adventure we do want to go on at some

1182
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,560
point. But from a fabrication standpoint

1183
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,319
it's a lot simpler if we could make this

1184
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,119
sheet flexible enough to then wrap

1185
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,800
around an object so that your sheet then

1186
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,040
kind of detects the shape of let's say a

1187
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,520
robot or a person and then further

1188
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,640
tracks those the deformation or

1189
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,400
movement. So the way this works is with

1190
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
wave guides that essentially have two

1191
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,359
different elastimemers, one with a

1192
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,520
higher refractive index than the other.

1193
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,839
The higher refractive index is on the

1194
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,720
inside. So that as you shine light down

1195
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:12,480
the core of that, then light bounces off

1196
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,720
that interface and keeps traveling down

1197
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,400
the wave guide. If you then we take a

1198
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,319
trick then from our friends across the

1199
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,640
river and then if you roughen one side

1200
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,000
of that, then it becomes a directional

1201
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,520
kind of uh bending sensor. So we can

1202
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,520
detect if you're kind of bending towards

1203
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,720
or away from the roughen side of that

1204
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,160
core. So then Chief played with that and

1205
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,000
realized that you can start to really

1206
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,720
tune kind of the sensitivity and

1207
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,920
linearity um from modifying the

1208
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,839
manufacturing process. Now usually it

1209
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,880
takes a while to manufacture any given

1210
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,800
thing. So um to save us some time he

1211
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,040
developed a simulation tool a design

1212
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,880
tool that then also takes into account

1213
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,280
where the kind of manufacturing

1214
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,480
limitations are and then by putting in

1215
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,640
some noise he chugged through to see

1216
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,359
kind of which configuration then gave

1217
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:06,440
him the most reliable recreation of

1218
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,440
these target shapes despite the noise.

1219
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,240
And so

1220
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,319
you can see we can recreate it's not

1221
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,480
fast. There's some optimization that

1222
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,359
could be done there, but we can recreate

1223
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,040
the shape. And then once we're done kind

1224
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,880
of shifting and deforming, we can't do

1225
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,160
this at the same time, but separately,

1226
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,319
you can then detect both the location of

1227
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,800
and intensity of pressure. This was less

1228
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,119
so for the deep sea projects unless we

1229
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,800
talk maybe about wets suits more so for

1230
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,200
in hopes to be useful for the physical

1231
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,200
therapy applications.

1232
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,880
Okay. But then we take just one of these

1233
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,040
wave guides and kind of quickly attached

1234
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,280
it to a finger for one of Sam's

1235
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,839
demonstrations. And so we essentially

1236
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,960
show that we can use that as a feedback

1237
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,040
mechanism for this finger that's being

1238
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,640
actuated by the engine. And what you're

1239
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,960
going to see is that this engine gets

1240
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,680
tired. The finger starts drifting and

1241
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:10,640
doesn't hit its target curvature.

1242
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,480
And then it's the bladder here is where

1243
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,400
we're emptying. That's our kind of

1244
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,079
standin central fuel source for the

1245
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,400
moment. Okay. Okay, so inspired by this

1246
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,520
then Sam and Chiang basically

1247
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,440
implemented a very simple P controller.

1248
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,359
And so here there are tests where we've

1249
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,520
got it under damped, critically damped,

1250
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,720
overdamped, but showing that you can use

1251
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,599
the optical sensors plugged into the

1252
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,200
monopropellant engine to then apply

1253
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:42,000
feedback to a simple actuator.

1254
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,560
And I hope you'll see kind of more of

1255
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,160
these soon. particularly I'm excited to

1256
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,400
tell people about some of our soft rigid

1257
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,000
stuff but for today that's the end of

1258
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,079
what I have for you

1259
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,280
and so I'll end with a little summary

1260
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,960
starting with a quote form follows

1261
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,760
function

1262
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,880
familiar one especially to designers I

1263
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,319
would say for soft robotics soft robotic

1264
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,400
form defines function

1265
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,720
and to design a soft robot is

1266
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,680
necessarily to design the process by

1267
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,680
which it's made.

1268
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,280
If we apply fabrication integrated

1269
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,520
design, we can get soft robots that are

1270
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,200
more durable, reliable, stronger,

1271
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,800
faster, and scalable. And I mean

1272
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,040
scalable in a manufacturing sense.

1273
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,960
And along the way, geometric and

1274
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,400
material optimization is necessary but

1275
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,319
not sufficient. Now, the same can be

1276
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,800
saying said about manufacturing. It's

1277
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,400
necessary but not sufficient. So, we're

1278
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,839
working towards a framework of soft

1279
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,920
machine design and manufacturing. And

1280
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,359
this is a multiddisciplinary

1281
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,280
community effort that we should all be

1282
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,359
working on, but certainly one that I'm

1283
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,760
excited to push in the fabrication

1284
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,520
integrated design lab.

1285
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,920
There's lots of people that I need to

1286
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,680
thank and I should really thank uh more

1287
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,520
than this, but mentors and collaborators

1288
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,800
that I wasn't able to catch along kind

1289
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,960
of the way of the slides and then my

1290
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,880
students. They're certainly kind of some

1291
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,720
of the very best moments of this job and

1292
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,560
I'm very lucky to be able to work with

1293
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,640
them every day. Thank you very much for

1294
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,839
putting up with me. Um, and also thank

1295
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,040
you all to listening to me on this

1296
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,640
Friday afternoon. I really appreciate

1297
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,670
it. And if we have time, we'll take

1298
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,440
questions.

1299
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:23,200
[Applause]

1300
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,599
>> All right.

1301
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,520
Thank you, Kate. Um, I found that the

1302
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:32,160
the kind of a combustion engine like uh

1303
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,960
power plant is very exciting because

1304
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,720
robot may have its own power plant

1305
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,960
inside, right? Um but I remember someone

1306
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,920
built the kind of octopus like machines.

1307
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,160
So is that different your stuff is a

1308
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,040
different principle or what's the

1309
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,359
difference one?

1310
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,960
>> Absolutely. So basically um and I meant

1311
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,040
to mention this but so using

1312
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,040
monopropellants for powering both soft

1313
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,720
robots and rigid robots is not new from

1314
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,720
us. There's a gard lab doing it with

1315
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,319
rigid robots and then it came out of

1316
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,400
Jennifer Lewis and Rob Woods lab with

1317
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:07,760
the octabot with Mike Vener and Ryan

1318
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,280
Trouy. Um so the piece that I think is

1319
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,520
really exciting here is that addition of

1320
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,760
the um that's new uh is the addition of

1321
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,680
the compliant membrane inside allows us

1322
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,240
to get to a much higher actuation

1323
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,160
pressure or yeah higher kind of output

1324
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,800
pressure than you could with any of the

1325
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,800
previous kind of demonstrated work. So

1326
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,040
the idea is by having that design that I

1327
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,760
would love to say is inspired by deep

1328
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,079
sea pumps, but it really just happens to

1329
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,640
look a lot like a deep sea pump that

1330
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,880
enables us to get higher pressure and

1331
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,800
then um kind of miniaturaturizing it in

1332
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,079
a way where to let us then distribute

1333
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,280
some of that power to soft robotics um

1334
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:50,079
so or to actuators. So it's we're

1335
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,000
getting to a higher flow. we need kind

1336
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,920
of more electrical signals and kind of

1337
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,280
active control of this and so you need a

1338
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,800
brain in the current instantiation

1339
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,960
whereas with the Octabot one it's all

1340
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,359
passive and just kind of runs out

1341
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,040
natural oscillations to control the

1342
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,960
behavior. Um so more direct control at

1343
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,720
the cost of electronics but then the

1344
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,280
ability to get to a higher actuation

1345
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,960
pressure so you could p power also um

1346
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,359
potentially larger systems. So I guess

1347
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,240
it's both. It's pressure andor just

1348
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,240
throughput of volume.

1349
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,160
But good question.

1350
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,160
>> All right. Is there more?

1351
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,839
>> Okay. Um I'll preface this with I'm not

1352
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,559
sure if a human is a soft robot or not,

1353
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:36,319
but it seems like a lot of the things

1354
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,079
that you're trying to achieve with soft

1355
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,720
robots can be done by like for example a

1356
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:43,599
human hand. um especially like the

1357
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,359
object detection or you know we can pick

1358
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,680
stuff up like very gently or very

1359
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:51,520
rigidly. Um have you looked at like

1360
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,480
humans for inspiration or have you

1361
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,160
thought about like what gives us the

1362
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,079
ability to do things that like maybe

1363
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,000
robots struggle with?

1364
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,520
>> Yeah, absolutely. I mean even just down

1365
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,839
to having a fingernail is really

1366
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,480
helpful. Um and so that's why a lot of

1367
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,720
my robots have this kind of like funny

1368
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,119
beak shape at the end. I think it's

1369
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,200
actually vestigual effect of exploring

1370
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,280
fingernails um and how that would be

1371
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,640
helpful in picking things up. But sure,

1372
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,160
absolutely I feel and then I feel

1373
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,720
inadequate every time I try to measure

1374
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,760
up to a human hand. Um but it is a great

1375
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,079
source of uh inspiration. I would say I

1376
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,400
certainly don't try to tend towards

1377
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,920
anthropomorphic mostly because I would

1378
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,079
say I'm an engineer to a fault and a

1379
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,599
manufacturing engineer to a fault where

1380
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,359
I try to make things that are then more

1381
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,119
streamlined for fabrication which is not

1382
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:42,079
necessarily anthropomorphic and then the

1383
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,440
form factor that that uh constraint puts

1384
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,000
on you then makes things a little bit

1385
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,839
tricky as far as your power output but

1386
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,599
yeah absolutely um there's a lot of fun

1387
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,480
things also even with perception kind of

1388
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,599
outside the hands too um or if you If

1389
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,880
any I'm sure a lot of people in this

1390
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,839
room have seen the video, if you numb

1391
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,400
someone's hands, um their ability to

1392
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,720
manipulate things is like so much worse

1393
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,319
than if they have all that full sensory.

1394
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,520
So, for example, someone I think it's a

1395
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,760
Swedish video of someone trying to

1396
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,040
strike a match and they struggle for a

1397
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,280
long time when you numb their

1398
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,720
fingertips. So, yeah, and I think it's

1399
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,400
going to be a balance for for me. I

1400
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,599
think the exciting piece of that is it's

1401
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:20,000
a balance of how certainly there's on

1402
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,680
the computation side. I'm on the meat

1403
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,319
space and fabrication side, which is to

1404
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,880
say what is the cost of implementing

1405
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,480
those. Can we because there's usually

1406
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,200
there's usually a trade-off between cost

1407
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,559
and complexity and manufacturing

1408
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,480
unless you come to something innovative

1409
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,839
where you can kind of break the trend.

1410
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,280
And so are there ways that we can kind

1411
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,599
of break the trend and be clever about

1412
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,760
fabrication. So it's so we both get more

1413
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,359
information but at a hopefully a lower

1414
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,559
cost.

1415
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,920
It's a good question.

1416
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,920
Is there more questions from the

1417
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,920
audience?

1418
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,160
>> Hey Caitlyn, lovely presentation by the

1419
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,040
way. So my question I have was I'm very

1420
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,680
curious about the use of sound as sort

1421
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,839
of a feedback sensor. Yep. and being

1422
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,040
able to sort of use like those patterns

1423
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,359
to detect shapes.

1424
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,640
>> Yeah,

1425
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,000
>> I know it's still very early and

1426
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,839
everything, but what I was curious is if

1427
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,480
you can go a little bit more into the

1428
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,079
estimation techniques you use to sort of

1429
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,720
infer what those shapes

1430
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,800
>> Yeah. are.

1431
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,359
>> Um, I would say I can't go too far into

1432
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,599
I mean it's uh I think we use a random

1433
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,040
forest uh machine learning algorithm

1434
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,480
which means that I won't be able to tell

1435
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,599
you much more than that but what I can

1436
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,000
tell you is more about the physics

1437
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,680
underlying it which is really cool. Um,

1438
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,520
basically you can your ear can hear kind

1439
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,839
of a surprising number of things based

1440
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,800
on the frequencies that come out of

1441
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:52,400
structures. So you can hear for example

1442
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:54,240
if something is made of wood or metal or

1443
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,839
glass. You can hear that if you hit

1444
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,520
something. You can hear that when

1445
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,960
instrument like musical instruments are

1446
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,720
played and someone can tell the

1447
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,040
difference between a French horn and a

1448
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,960
violin or even a French horn and a

1449
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,599
trumpet for example. And a lot of that

1450
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,359
is based on not just the fundamental

1451
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,440
frequency, which is the pitch that you

1452
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,119
hear, but the harmonics. And that's what

1453
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,359
we're looking to play with. And

1454
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,720
basically, it's both the kind of like

1455
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,480
intensity of harmonics, how many you

1456
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,559
have, and harmonics being multiples of

1457
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,720
the fundamental frequency, and then also

1458
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,640
how much aberration you have in each of

1459
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,119
those. Are they kind of very stark,

1460
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,480
sharp lines at multiples of the

1461
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,640
fundamental frequency, or is there a

1462
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,319
little bit of aberration and noise? So

1463
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,800
what you hear in for example like a

1464
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,040
violin is there's actually many more

1465
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,000
overtones and then with that wood sound

1466
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,240
you actually get a little bit more

1467
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,760
aberration versus a French horn you have

1468
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,720
very few overtones or harmonics and then

1469
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,559
they have a really sharp peak. Um so we

1470
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,720
hope to use that a little bit in kind of

1471
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,040
getting more information about objects

1472
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,119
but it's really it's a really I think

1473
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,200
great result for an undergrad research

1474
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,319
project. I'm stoked and excited to see

1475
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,800
where it goes. Thank you for the

1476
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,400
question.

1477
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,319
Great. I think we are reaching the end

1478
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,319
of the hour. So, let's thank our speaker

1479
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,319
again.
