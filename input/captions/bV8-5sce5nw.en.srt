Episode

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,840
9. All there is to unlearn.

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,680
Old habits die hard. We have all

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,320
invested a lifetime learning with the

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
sole objective of trying to be right.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,199
Often our jobs require that we be always

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
right and that we certify our expertise.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
But in this new mindset, to even start

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,520
innovating, you may need to accept that

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
you are most likely wrong from the

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,120
start. It will take some unlearning.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,800
Each video in this series introduces one

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,440
idea to help you wrestle with what you

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
may need to unlearn. The following ideas

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,399
extracted from the videos you have just

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,120
seen can help. One, I have hinted that

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
innovating is a process of exploration.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,079
The difficulty with any kind of

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
exploration is keeping yourself honest

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
and open-minded. I find it useful to

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,600
remind myself that there's a few things

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,080
we humans are really bad at and some

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,159
that we are really good at. Here they

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,960
go. We're notoriously bad at having good

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
ideas in just one go.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,680
We're bad at inventing something

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,439
entirely from scratch.

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
We are horrible at predicting the

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,080
future. And we're even worse at

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,600
remembering how bad we are at predicting

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
the future.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
And then there is the things we are

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
actually good at. We are really good at

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
coming up with hunches.

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720
We're really good at reusing stuff. We

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,280
excel at saying that something will not

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,079
work. And we truly enjoy storytelling.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,479
Two, I invited you to let go of the idea

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,640
of fail fast and to replace it for a

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,159
pursuit of excellence. What I'm asking

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,520
you to do is to build companies and

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,960
projects that fail to fail.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,640
Three.

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,840
I have offered you an alternative to all

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,600
the innovation entrepreneurship

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,759
frameworks that require you to settle on

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
the product and the user before you even

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,320
start. We spoke about prototyping

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
problems and advancing a portfolio of

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
solutions.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
Four, we distinguish between focusing

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
and narrowing. You can focus on the

53
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,000
problem and keep a space of options

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,239
open. Your risk goes up if you narrow

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,440
your options.

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,040
Five. Our own garage story suggests that

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
there was a time in which we did not

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,239
believe that spending little by little

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,160
was how you founded big projects.

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,920
This may have important implications for

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,640
how you decide to fund projects going

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,400
forward. At the very least, it may help

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,319
calibrate the real risk behind the

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
stringing along projects with little

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,200
amounts of funding.

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,280
Six. There's many more ideas we only

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
touched on partially like how to create

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
value from the technology shelf,

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
repurposing technologies, other ways to

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
prototype problems, the difference

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,239
between precision and accuracy, the

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,959
curse of hindsight, and the true meaning

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
of scale up to name some. You can learn

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,879
more about many of those from the book

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
Innovating Ador's Manifesto or following

76
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,959
my work.

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
There is just this one idea I told you

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
about at the very start of this series

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
of videos that I would like to come back

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
to. We are sitting on a gold mine of

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,519
underutilized technologies. That's the

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,519
last video in this series.
