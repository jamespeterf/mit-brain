1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,319
Great. So, I'm Scott, the CTO at Line

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,279
Lab. My background is in mechanical

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,200
engineering and operations. I co-founded

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,040
Line Lab with another MIT colleague

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,400
after related research collaboration

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,839
with Boeing. And so, currently there's a

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,440
big problem across industries of

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,080
struggling to engineer production and

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,160
supply chain to scale. Elon Musk talks

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
just about how hard the problem is and

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
at the same time we see huge capacity

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
being added in manufacturing. But the

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
inability to address the scaling design

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,599
problem is having major impact on

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
incumbents and startups and scaleups

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
alike. It's a significant problem not

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
just in terms of dollars but also in

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
missing capacity in the industrial base.

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,840
And what sits at the core of this

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,280
problem in most cases is this inability

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,040
to have accurate and informative

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,360
analysis to bridge the valley of death

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,760
into scaled profitable production after

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
a lot of initial investment. Excel can't

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
do this and traditional simulation tools

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
can't either. It's exactly here that

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Line Lab finally delivers a real

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,680
solution.

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Line Lab is new software that fixes the

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,359
way supply chains and production systems

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,360
are designed. Now, for the first time,

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,360
the problem can be solved from right to

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
left where we can input the design and

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,920
the manufacturing steps and the goals

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,680
for scale, rate, cost, etc. And Line Lab

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
will handle the thousands of trade-offs

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,799
to give us a prescriptive result about

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,880
how the system should be configured. At

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
its core is new technology for modeling

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
the complex interactions, variability,

41
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,040
and randomness in the production system

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,799
and supply chain. This is built on pure

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
mass and not AI. So there's no

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
hallucination or unpredictability. This

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,960
is right alongside the sophisticated

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
financial modeling which allows for all

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
of the decisions to be in business

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
relevant context. With transparency

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
characterizing the impact of every

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,119
input, teams are able to effectively

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,159
design course defined and focus efforts

52
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,000
on high-risisk decisions. When Line Lab

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
is run, it's automatically designing the

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,119
production system to meet the

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
requirements and constraints. It's

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,600
designing things like optimal capacity,

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
flow time, critical path, inventory, and

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
other resources. The minimal inputs

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
needed are the manufacturing process

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
steps, resource costs, and performance

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
requirements. But all these can be input

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,679
with uncertainty. Additional constraints

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,760
can be added like maximum floor space,

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,400
maximum capital, fixed existing

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,239
equipment, etc. So line lab can really

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
cover the range from updating existing

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,080
production to designing totally new

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,319
green field sites. We see a quick

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
example of processes, costs and rates

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,080
being updated and an entirely new

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,920
production system is designed that meets

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
those requirements

73
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
as outputs. We are getting things like

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,040
total cost the optimization of capacity

75
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,040
utilization and inventory. Line lab is

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
also producing the trade of how unit

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
cost actually changes with production

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,959
capacity. And finally, line lab is

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,519
characterizing and ranking the main cost

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,440
drivers across design, operations, and

81
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,239
finance to really give the insight on

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:56,879
which levers to pull. As an example,

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,360
a a major aerospace OEM, there you go.

84
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,120
Major aerospace UA OEM used line lab to

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
perform the trade-off analysis between

86
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,440
two production technologies with very

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
different TRL MRL. The model this in

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
line lab they were finally able to

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,280
quantify those maturity differences

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,959
using uncertainties on the inputs. Line

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
lab was then able to characterize the

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,280
resulting output uncertainties like in

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
unit cost for example. The team then

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
used the risk analysis shown here with

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,800
the size of the bubbles to determine

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
which factors were most significant for

97
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
selecting a technology. Using these data

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,560
they were able to quite clearly direct

99
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,159
their efforts and resources to only the

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
factors that mattered for de-risisking

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,799
the decision. As a result, capital costs

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
were reduced, unit costs improved, and

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
the design cycle substantially

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
accelerated.

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
So, we are looking for companies who

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,519
want to pilot Mine Lab. Generally,

107
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
Meline Lab is answering questions around

108
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,680
the costs and manufacturing strategy for

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
new products or new production. And it's

110
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,480
honestly never too early in the product

111
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,680
life cycle to start using line lab. Data

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
don't have to be complete or

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
sophisticated to have a big impact. It's

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
really about making better strategic

115
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,439
decisions in the system and flow where

116
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
those big levers are. We've worked with

117
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,599
customers in diverse verticals and we're

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,319
always open to more and exploring

119
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,000
exciting new potential applications. So,

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,599
if this sounds relevant to the problems

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
you're facing, feel free to reach out to

122
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,920
me and we'd love to consider the uh

123
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
conversation.
