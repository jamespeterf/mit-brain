1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,759
all right thanks Aran this five minute

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,359
um presentation format is great I'll

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,000
test it tomorrow in my class let's see

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,840
how the students react um so I'm yob

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,360
bjon I'm a professor of nuclear science

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,119
and engineering at MIT also co-founder

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,920
of um fto energy we refer to it as a

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,920
clean energy solutions company so who

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,680
are we well we might not Shine for um

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,160
gender diversity but we have a good

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,519
diversity of backgrounds here ranging

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,599
from architecture Norman Foster you

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,680
might have heard of him um nuclear

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:39,000
technology myself Roberto kazoua the um

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,640
uh energy World Michael Ford uh for

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,960
operations of energy systems finances

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
wad uh design

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,399
Etc okay so what's the problem or what's

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,039
our goal uh is to deliver plentiful

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,760
energy that is secure environmentally

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,879
sustainable and uh equitably uh

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,079
equitably distributed

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,119
um and I would argue the challenge at

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,880
the moment is that current low energy

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,439
Alternatives whether they're wind solar

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
or even nuclear on the grid are often

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,840
not um easily adapted to remote offgrade

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,720
locations industrial process they don't

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,960
scale well they're not available

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,360
everywhere and often they're not U

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,479
affordable so what is our solution well

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,079
it's center around a technology that we

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,920
call uh the nuclear battery nuclear

34
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,799
battery really is a small nuclear

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,680
reactor nuclear fusion reactor just to

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
be clear not Fusion which is still a few

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,360
years out there um generating of the

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,399
order of 10 maybe 20 megawatts a nuclear

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,960
reactor is a heat Source if you want

40
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,880
electricity you got aou it to a turbo

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,759
generator and you get electricity but

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,880
naturally you get both heat and

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,240
electricity combin which a lot of

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,759
customers are interested in um nuclear

45
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,640
is zero carbon in operation life cycle

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,600
CO2 emissions very low comparable to to

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,399
wind lower than anything else out there

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,000
the idea of these small reactors here

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,000
you see in our artistic rendering not

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,479
very realistic but great because it was

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,560
made by Norman himself um of what a

52
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,000
nuclear battery might look like but um

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,640
the idea of this small reactor these

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
nuclear batteries to be uh Mass

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,519
fabricated in factories completely

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,959
standardized sort of plug and play uh

57
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,519
which means really days between the time

58
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,760
that these machines arrive to the side

59
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,360
to the time you start generating your

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,200
your heat and electricity um they could

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,280
operate for 3 to 10 years without

62
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,800
refueling that's the beauty of nuclear

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,560
the energy density of the fuel is

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,319
extraordinarily High millions of times

65
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,720
higher than fossil fuel so there is not

66
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,800
a need for frequent refueling um they

67
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,800
can be air cooled you know reject the

68
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,720
waste heat essentially to the atmosphere

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,840
instead of um being linked to proximity

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,040
to a body of water be it the ocean a

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,680
river Etc semi-autonomous operations

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,519
that's required because a lot of uh

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,360
operators would basically break the

74
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,000
business model for these

75
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,319
things now um what is unique about these

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,799
nuclear batteries other than what I

77
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,400
already said well um they're very small

78
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,920
side footprint this basically fit in

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,640
shipping containers and the whole site

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,560
could be order of an acre for generation

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,519
of say 10 or plus megawatts of

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,879
electricity 24/7 and clean uh

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,640
incremental capacity you could basically

84
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,680
uh provision the capacity incrementally

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,640
um with small um initial capital

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,400
investment unlike traditional nuclear

87
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,239
plants which of course will set you back

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,360
building ions and billions of dollars I

89
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,439
already mentioned transporter

90
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,799
redeployable very very robust uh safety

91
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,760
profile and nuclear is not the cheapest

92
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,720
is never the cheapest but once it's

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,560
built then actually its cost is pretty

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,239
predictable and for some applications

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,439
this predictability over a long period

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,439
of time is um is highly desirable now

97
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,280
fto is not a nuclear technology

98
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,480
development company we don't have our

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,760
own nuclear battery design in spite of

100
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,439
the pretty picture that I show you

101
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,040
earlier but we work with very

102
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,560
established nuclear re reor companies

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,319
I'm sure you have heard of Westing gals

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
you might not be familiar with bwxt

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,920
that's actually the company that makes

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,239
reactors for the US Nuclear Navy for

107
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,959
submarines and AFA carriers and these

108
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,040
companies have been developing these

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,560
nuclear batteries and so so what do we

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,720
do well we are really a uh project

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,280
development and execution company so we

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,919
pull together the expertise that we have

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,280
in house with working with uh reactor

114
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,840
vendors with customers Etc to set up

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,320
projects where these nuclear batteries

116
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,919
are Caple to some production activities

117
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,000
that the clients are interested the

118
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,360
customers are interested in and realize

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,080
and integrated a clean energy clean

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
energy system and so here you see some

121
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,320
of the keywords of things that we um are

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
eager to work on that they range from

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,479
technoeconomic analysis of course that

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,680
would be the front end to show the

125
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,360
promise of the project um nuclear

126
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,479
reactor design safety and materials

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,000
evaluation operations and training

128
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,280
assembly etc etc so we like to think

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,800
about ourselves as being at the center

130
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,199
of a little ecosystem of again vendors

131
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,919
prospective um operators of these

132
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,160
machines and the model here that we have

133
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,360
in mind is a fleet of nuclear batteries

134
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,840
it doesn't make sense to have one off

135
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,440
you got to be able to operate a fleet of

136
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,880
potentially hundreds maybe thousands

137
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,199
being optimistically of these nuclear

138
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,720
batteries because that's how the cost

139
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,000
particularly the operating cost are

140
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,960
going to come down because there is a

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,240
range of services that operating

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
refueling and maintaining these machines

143
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,080
is going to require and that again makes

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,160
sense if you you have a multiple of uh a

145
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
multiple of units so we are ready to

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,280
support across many sectors again this

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,400
is sort of the uh the value proposition

148
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,639
here is this is not for the grid and as

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,319
we know the grid is only what a quarter

150
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,759
of the CO2 emissions uh is associated

151
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,960
with the grid the rest is industry

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,880
buildings um transportation Etc and so

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
this solution we think based on our

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,039
analysis is almost like the you know the

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,919
Swiss knife equivalent of the energy

156
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,840
world you could use it almost everywhere

157
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,400
and so we're ready to support and

158
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,199
deliver and we just finished our first

159
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,080
front end assessment for an offshore oil

160
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,800
and gas that desires to uh decarbonize

161
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,479
their offshore applications and it looks

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,000
pretty promising so with that I stop I

163
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,440
think I ran out of time so I can't tell

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,599
you exactly uh what the meaning of fto

165
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,240
energy is but if you're curious come

166
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,560
come see me at the at the table out

167
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,920
there and I'll tell you what's behind

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,459
the name thank you

169
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,459
[Applause]
