dramatic steps the US government has

recently taken to combat climate change

transfer of power in the United States

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,120
forced to face a seemingly unending

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,840
series of Once inag generation crises

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,399
how can the world continue to focus

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,920
attention on goals around carbon

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
emissions and climate change that was

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,239
the question posed by Philip R sharp the

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,920
former president of resources for the

19
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:51,920
future and a former 10-term member of

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,879
the US House of Representatives from

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,320
Indiana during his MIT energy initiative

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,000
fall colloquium address titled the

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,239
prospects for decarbonization in America

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,159
will global and domestic crises disrupt

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,200
our plans perhaps surprisingly sharp

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,119
sounded an optimistic note in his answer

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,360
despite deep political divisions in the

28
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,280
United States he noted Congress has

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,479
passed five major pieces of legislation

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,520
under both president Donald Trump and

31
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,240
President Joseph Biden aimed at

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,200
accelerating decarbonization efforts

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,600
rather than hampering movement to combat

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,520
climate change sharp said domestic and

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,280
Global crises have seemed to Galvanize

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,560
support create new incentives for action

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,200
and even unify political Rivals around

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,119
the cause almost everybody is dealing

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,079
with to some degree the absolutely

40
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,799
profound churning events that we are in

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,119
midst now most of them are unexpected

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,880
and therefore we're not prepared for

43
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,240
them and they have had a profound

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,040
shaking of our thinking sharp said the

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,520
conventional wisdom has not held up in

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,240
almost all of these areas and therefore

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,880
it makes it much more difficult for us

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,719
to think we know how to predict an

49
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,759
uncertain future and it causes us to

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,560
question our own abilties a nation or

51
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,280
anywhere to actually take on these

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
challenges and obviously climate change

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,160
is one of the most important however

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,080
sharp continued these challenges have in

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,319
some instances spurred action the war in

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,040
Ukraine he noted has upset European

57
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,040
energy markets but has also highlighted

58
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,680
the importance of countries achieving a

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,720
more energy independent posture through

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,519
Renewables in America he added we've

61
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,599
actually seen absolutely stunning

62
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,599
Behavior by the United States Congress

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,319
of all places what we've witnessed is

64
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,800
Congress put out incredible sums of

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,760
money under the previous administration

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,720
and then under this Administration to

67
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,040
deal with the co crisis sharp added

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,159
later in his talk and then the United

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,560
States government came together red and

70
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,400
blue to support the ukrainians against

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,440
Russia it saddens me to say it seems to

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
take a Russian invasion or the Chinese

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,280
probing us economically to get us moving

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,720
but we are moving and these things are

75
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,200
happening Congressional

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,120
action sharp cautioned against getting

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,799
caught up in the familiar Viewpoint that

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,640
Congress in its current Incarnation is

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,400
fundamentally incapable of passing

80
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,760
meaningful legislation he pointed in

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,599
particular to the passage of five laws

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,560
over the previous 2 years the 2020

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,560
energy act which has been characterized

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,000
as a down payment on fighting climate

85
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,560
change the infrastructure investment and

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,720
jobs act sometimes called the bipartisan

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
infrastructure bill which calls for

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,080
investments in passenger rail electric

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,040
vehicle infrastructure electric school

90
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,360
buses and other clean energy measures

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,360
the chips and science act a $280 billion

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,799
effort to revitalize the American

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,000
Semiconductor industry which some

94
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,439
analysts say could direct roughly one

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,720
quarter of its funding toward

96
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,159
accelerating zero carbon Industries and

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,400
conducting climate research the

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,640
inflation reduction act called by some

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
the largest climate legislation in US

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,480
history which includes tax credits

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,680
incentives and other Provisions to help

102
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,280
private companies tackle climate change

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,480
increase investments in renewable energy

104
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,519
and enhance Energy Efficiency the kagali

105
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,519
amendment to the Montreal protocol

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,680
ratified by the Senate to little Fanfare

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
in September under which the United

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,320
States agree to reduce the consumption

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,120
and production of hydrocarbons

110
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
hfc's it is a big deal sharp said of the

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
dramatic increase in federal climate

112
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,280
action it is very significant actions

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,560
that are being taken more than what we

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,240
would expect or I would expect out of

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,440
the Congress at any one time along with

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,360
the many billions of dollars of climate

117
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,120
related Investments included in the

118
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,400
legislation sharp said these new laws

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,120
will have a number of positive spillover

120
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,240
effects this enables state governments

121
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,199
in their policies to be more aggressive

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,880
sharp said why because it makes it

123
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
cheaper for some of the Investments that

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,199
they will try to force within their

125
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,720
state another pretty obvious spillover

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
effect sharp said is that the new laws

127
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,120
will enhance us credibility in

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
international

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
negotiations finally he said these

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,199
public investments will make the US

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,440
economy more competitive in

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,720
international markets for clean energy

133
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,520
technology particularly as the United

134
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,000
States seeks to compete against China in

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,039
the space competition with China has

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,600
become a motivator in American politics

137
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,600
like it or not sharp said there is no

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,680
question that it is causing and bringing

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,160
together politicians across blue States

140
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,280
and red

141
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,960
States holding on to

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,560
progress even in an uncertain political

143
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,560
climate in which Democrats and

144
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,080
Republicans seem unable to agree on

145
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,080
basic facts recent funding commitments

146
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,560
are likely to survive no matter which

147
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,120
party controls Congress and the

148
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,759
presidency sharp said that's because

149
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,880
most of the legislation relies on

150
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,000
broadly popular carrots that reward

151
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,080
investments in

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,160
decarbonization rather than less popular

153
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,280
sticks that create new restrictions or

154
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,520
punishments for companies to fail to

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,039
decarbonize politically the impact of

156
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,160
the this is very significant sharp said

157
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,560
it is so much easier in politics to give

158
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,360
away tax credits than it is to penalize

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
or put requirements on people the fact

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,840
is that these tax credits are more

161
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,240
likely to be politically sustained than

162
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,240
other forms of government intervention

163
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,639
that at least has been the history sharp

164
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
stressed the importance of what he

165
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,759
called Civil Society institutions such

166
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,759
as universities nonprofits churches and

167
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,720
other organizations that are apart from

168
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,759
government and business in promoting

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,280
decarbonization efforts those groups can

170
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,639
act highly independently and therefore

171
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,919
they can drive for things that others

172
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,560
are not willing to do now this does not

173
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,520
always work to good purposes partly this

174
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,479
diversity in this decentralization in

175
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,319
Civil Society led to deniers and others

176
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,280
being able to stop some climate action

177
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,400
but now my view is this is starting to

178
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,400
all move in the right direction in a

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,960
very Dynamic and a very important way

180
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,120
what we have seen over the last few

181
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,800
years is a big uptick in philanthropy

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,000
related to

183
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,120
climate looking

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,560
ahead Sharp's optimism even extended to

185
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,319
the role of social media he suggested

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
that the wild west era of social

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,280
platforms may be ending pointing to the

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
celebrities who have recently lost

189
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,639
valuable business Partnerships for

190
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,520
spreading hate speech and

191
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,199
disinformation we're now a lot more

192
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,160
alert to the dangers he said some in the

193
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,440
audience questioned sharp about specific

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
paths toward

195
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,000
decarbonization but sharp said that

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,319
progress will require a number of

197
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,199
desperate approaches some of which will

198
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,160
inevitably have a greater impact than

199
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,479
others the current policy and the policy

200
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,240
embedded in this new legislation is all

201
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,280
about doing both he said it's all about

202
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,639
advancing current Technologies into the

203
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,319
marketplace and at the same time driving

204
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,800
for breakthroughs above all sharp

205
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,440
stressed the need for continued

206
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,560
Collective action around climate change

207
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,199
the fact is we're all contributors to

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,199
some degree he said but we also all can

209
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,360
do something in my view this is clearly

210
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,479
not a time for hand ringing this is a

211
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,440
Time for Action people have to roll up

212
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,720
their sleeves and go to work and not

213
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,720
roll them down any time soon
