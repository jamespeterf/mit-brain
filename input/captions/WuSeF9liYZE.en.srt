written by Deborah

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,320
halber Michael Howland was in his office

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,160
at MIT watching real-time data from a

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,760
wind farm 7,000 M away in Northwest

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,480
India when he noticed something odd some

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,240
of the turbines weren't producing the

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,119
expected amount of electricity Howland

mental engineering studies the physics

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,800
of the Earth's atmosphere and how that

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,039
information can optimize Renewable

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,879
Energy Systems to accomplish this he and

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,879
his team develop and use predictive

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,199
models supercomputer simulations and

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,039
real life data from wind farms such as

across the world the global wind energy

00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:02,239
Council reported last year the Year 2020

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,320
saw record growth in wind power capacity

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,119
thanks to a surge of installations in

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,200
China and the United States yet wind

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,840
power needs to grow three times faster

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,920
in the coming decade to address the

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,920
worst impacts of climate change and

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,159
Achieve Federal and State climate goals

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,079
the report says optimal Wind Farm design

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,840
and the resulting cost of energy are

33
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,079
dependent on the Wind Helen says but

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,320
wind farms are often cited and designed

35
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,079
based on short-term historical climate

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,200
records in October 2021 Howland received

37
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,439
a seed fund Grant from the MIT energy

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
initiative Mighty to account for how

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,040
climate change might affect the wind of

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,720
the future our initial results suggests

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
that considering the uncertainty and the

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,799
winds in the design and operation of

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,200
wind farms can lead to more reliable

44
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,040
energy production he says most recently

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
Howland and his team came up with a

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,960
model that predicts the power produced

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,280
by each individual turbine based on the

48
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,320
physics of the Wind Farm as a whole the

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,960
model can inform decisions that may

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,640
boost a Farm's overall

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,920
output the state of the planet growing

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,640
up in a suburb of Philadelphia the son

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,519
of neuroscientists howland's childhood

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,519
wasn't especially outdoorsy later he'd

55
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,280
become an avid hiker with a deep

56
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,080
appreciation for nature but a nth grade

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
class assignment made him think about

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,000
the state of the planet perhaps for the

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,800
first time a history teacher had asked

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,319
the class to write a report on climate

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,239
change I remember arguing with my high

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,640
school classmates about whether humans

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
were the leading cause of climate change

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,840
but the teacher didn't want to get into

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,760
that debate Howland recalls he said

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,000
climate change was happening whether or

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,640
not you accept that it's anthropogenic

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,400
and he wanted us to think about the

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,319
impacts of global warming and solutions

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,239
I was one of his vigorous Defenders as

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,760
part of a research internship after his

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,440
freshman year of college Howland visited

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,840
a wind farm in Iowa where wind produces

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,120
more than half of the state's

75
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,120
electricity the turbines look tall from

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,159
the highway but when you're underneath

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
them you're really struck by their scale

78
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,319
he says that's where you get a sense of

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,760
how colossal they really are not a fan

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,560
of heights howand opted not to climb the

81
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,440
turbine's internal ladder to snap a

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,200
undergraduate degree from John's Hopkins

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,080
University and M's and PhD degrees in

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
mechanical engineering from Stanford

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,280
University he joined mit's Department of

87
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
Civil and environmental engineering to

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,400
focus on the intersection of fluid

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,760
mechanics weather climate and energy

90
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,319
modeling his goal is to enhance

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,000
Renewable Energy Systems an added bonus

92
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,400
to being at MIT is the opportunity to

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,200
inspire the Next Generation much like

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,400
his nth grade history teacher did for

95
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,959
him hen's graduate level introduction to

96
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,640
the atmospheric boundary layer is geared

97
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,239
primarily to engineers and physicists

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,480
but as he sees it climate change is such

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,720
a multi disciplinary and complex

100
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,280
challenge that every skill set that

101
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,879
exists in human society can be relevant

102
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,000
to mitigating it there are the physics

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,200
and Engineering questions that our lab

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,599
primarily works on but there are also

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,120
questions related to social sciences

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,359
public acceptance policymaking and

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,600
implementation he says careers in

108
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,759
renewable energy are rapidly growing

109
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,520
there are far more job openings than we

110
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,400
can hire for right now in many areas we

111
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,800
don't yet have enough people to address

112
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,520
the challenges in renewable energy and

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,039
climate change mitigation that need to

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,600
be solved I encourage my students really

115
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,759
everyone I interact with to find a way

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,520
to impact the climate change problem he

117
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,120
says unusual

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,240
conditions in Fall 2021 Howland was

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,440
trying to explain the odd data coming in

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,199
from India based on sensor feedback wind

121
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,320
turbin softwar driven Control Systems

122
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,199
constantly tweak the speed and the angle

123
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,680
of the blades and what's known as yaw

124
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,360
the orientation of the giant blades in

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,720
relation to the wind direction existing

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,160
utility scale turbines are controlled

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,520
greedily which means that every turbine

128
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
in the farm automatically turns into the

129
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,199
wind to maximize its own power

130
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
production though the turbines in the

131
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,000
front row of the Indian Wind Farm were

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
reacting appropriately to the wind

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,960
direction their power output was all

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,039
over the place not what we would expect

135
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,080
based on the existing models Howland

136
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,120
says these massive turbine Towers stood

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,560
at 100 m about the length of a football

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,120
field with blades the length of an

139
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,680
Olympic swimming pool at their highest

140
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,240
point the blade tips lunged almost 200 M

141
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,039
into the sky then there's the speed of

142
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,039
the blades themselves the tips move many

143
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,280
times faster than the wind around 80 to

144
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,919
100 m per second up to a quarter or a

145
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,759
third of the speed of sound using a

146
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,680
state-of-the-art sensor that measures

147
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,639
the speed of incoming wind before it

148
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,960
interacts with the massive rotors

149
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,800
howland's team saw an unexpectedly

150
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,720
complex airflow effect he covers the

151
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,319
phenomenon in his class the data coming

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,759
in from India he says displayed quite

153
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,080
remarkable wind conditions stemming from

154
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
the effects of Earth's rotation and the

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,000
physics of buoyancy that you don't

156
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,080
always see traditionally wind turbines

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,639
operate in the lowest 10% of the

158
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,280
atmospheric boundary layer the so-called

159
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,960
surface layer affected primarily by

160
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,160
ground conditions the Indian turbines

161
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,199
howand realized were operating in

162
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,400
regions of the atmosphere that turbines

163
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
haven't historically

164
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,520
accessed trending

165
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,599
taller Howland knew that airflow

166
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,360
interactions can persist for kilometers

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,840
the interaction of high winds with the

168
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
front row turbines was generating wakes

169
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,319
in the air similar to the way boats

170
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,520
generate wakes in the water to address

171
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,280
this howland's model trades off the

172
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,080
efficiency of upwind turbines to benefit

173
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,560
downwind ones by misaligning some of the

174
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,000
upwind turbines in certain conditions

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,759
the downwind units experience less wake

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,440
turbulence increasing the overall energy

177
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,240
output of the wind farm by as much as 1%

178
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,560
to 3% without requiring additional costs

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,919
if a 1.2% energy increase was applied to

180
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,759
the world's existing wind farms it would

181
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,639
be the equivalent of adding more than

182
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,319
3,600

183
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,840
new wind turbines enough to power about

184
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,800
3 million homes even a modest boost

185
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,440
could mean fewer turbines generating the

186
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,000
same output or the ability to place more

187
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,639
units into a smaller space because

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,400
negative interactions between the

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,599
turbines can be diminished Howen says

190
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,599
the model can predict potential benefits

191
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,879
in a variety of scenarios at different

192
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,080
types of wind farms the part that's

193
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,720
important and exciting is that it's not

194
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,680
just particular to this wind farm we can

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,080
apply the colle Ive control method

196
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,000
across the windfarm fleet he says which

197
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,000
is growing taller and wider by 2035 the

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,840
average Hub height for offshore turbines

199
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,159
in the United States is projected to

200
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,720
grow from 100 m to around 150 M the

201
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,199
height of the Washington

202
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,639
Monument as we continue to build larger

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,680
wind turbines and larger wind farms we

204
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,520
need to revisit the existing practice

205
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
for their design and control Howen says

206
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,280
we can use our predictive models to

207
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,000
ensure that we build an operate the most

208
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,320
efficient renewable generators

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,640
possible looking to the

210
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,880
Future Howland and other climate

211
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,320
Watchers have reason for optimism with

212
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,800
the passage in August 2022 of the

213
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,839
inflation reduction act which calls for

214
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,080
a significant investment in domestic

215
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:52,480
energy production and for reducing

216
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,519
carbon emissions by roughly 40% by

217
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,800
2030 but Helen says the act itself isn't

218
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,880
sufficient we need to continue pushing

219
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,600
the envelope in research and development

220
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,760
as well as deployment he says the model

221
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
he created with his team can help

222
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,720
especially for offshore wind farms

223
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,640
experiencing low wind turbulence and

224
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,399
larger wake interactions offshore wind

225
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,560
can face challenges of public acceptance

226
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,760
Howen believes that researchers policy

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,200
makers and the energy industry need to

228
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,120
do more to get the public on board by

229
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,519
addressing concerns through open public

230
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,399
dialogue Outreach and education Howland

231
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,800
once wrote and Illustrated a children's

232
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,480
book inspired by Dr SS's The Lorax that

233
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,560
focused on renewable energy howand

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
recalls his really terrible

235
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,399
illustrations but he believes he was on

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,320
to something I was having some fun

237
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,360
helping people interact with alternative

238
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,040
energy in a more natural way at an

239
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,519
earlier age he says and recognize that

240
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:55,040
these are not nefarious Technologies but

241
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,040
remarkable Feats of human ingenuity
