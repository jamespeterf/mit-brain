1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:02,395
(bright music)

2
00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:04,224
(motorcycle engines roaring)

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:07,641
(bright music continues)

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,512
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:19,026
(David laughs)

6
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:26,916
(upbeat music continues)

7
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,026
(wheels squeaking)

8
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:38,239
(bright music)

9
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:46,383
(bird squawking)

10
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:47,327
(glass shattering)

11
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:49,230
(students guffaw)

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,242
- Oh my God, it's Product Man.

13
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:53,298
I can't believe it.

14
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:54,203
(students applaud)

15
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:57,921
- Product Man at your service.

16
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,190
(students applaud)
(upbeat music continues)

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,990
I'm David Wallace,

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,470
a mechanical engineering
design professor at MIT.

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,850
Play seriously?

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,067
Now, that's a thought.

21
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,410
And smash through the glass

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,200
and then I kinda pose
in my superhero pose.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
- Oh my God, it's Product Man.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,980
I can't believe it.

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,540
- When I look at my own work

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,310
or watch others in theirs,

27
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,530
when really good things are happening,

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,920
we're energized, vibrant, excited.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,200
Here's the detonator with the safety key.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,864
- [Assistant] Okay, it wasn't plugged in.

31
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:30,840
(students laugh)

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,120
- [David] We're so serious
about the importance

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,500
of what we are doing.

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,333
(electricity pops)

35
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,166
- Whoa.

36
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,650
- [Students] Oh!

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,080
- And that could be really stressful.

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,330
But somehow it isn't.

39
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,610
Product Man at your service.

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,050
- The prototype just shorted.

41
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,820
And it scared everyone here.

42
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,630
- It feels like we're solving
a puzzle, like a game.

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,800
This is a gag product
and it worked perfectly.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,950
We feel free to have fanciful thoughts

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,470
and we're not afraid of a mistake

46
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,590
and we're really determined to succeed.

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,480
- Thank you, Product Man.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,430
- Doesn't that sound like play?

49
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,571
I'm here to protect design, debugging,

50
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:14,226
and the 2.009 Way.

51
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:15,059
Gotta go.

52
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:17,940
When solving hard
problems become like play,

53
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,064
good things tend to happen.

54
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,479
(upbeat music continues)

55
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,142
(upbeat music)

56
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:27,528
(students chattering indistinctly)

57
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,006
(drill whirring)

58
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:29,839
(upbeat music continues)

59
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:32,400
In our design class at MIT,

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,770
we're very serious about learning

61
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,720
and solving real problems.

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,740
We're working to become
better engineers and designers

63
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,200
to do things that matter.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,910
And in the class, we pair all
this seriousness with play.

65
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,850
We're playful, quite literally.

66
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,318
It's serious engineering wrapped in fun.

67
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,620
(students yelling indistinctly)

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,060
So, the students come in

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,190
knowing we're gonna
have a build challenge,

70
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,590
knowing we're gonna have a theme reveal.

71
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,960
They know there's going
to be these playful events

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,430
throughout the entire course.

73
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,250
So, they arrive with anticipation.

74
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,888
They're waiting for it.

75
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:11,379
(upbeat music continues)

76
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,828
(machines booming)

77
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:13,661
Whoa!

78
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:15,660
And so then when it happens,

79
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,677
they're already invested and saying,

80
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:20,880
"We wanna make this something
we feel good about."

81
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,860
The reveal signals, hey, it's starting.

82
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,420
Now is go time.

83
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,670
And we take this very seriously.

84
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,760
We take it so seriously,
we'll spend hundreds of hours

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,675
making a playful reveal
that lasts 20 minutes.

86
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:36,150
- My opinion matters more.

87
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,670
- Oh, yeah.
(glass shatters)

88
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,790
(students gasp)

89
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,180
We smash a bottle over my head. Why?

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,330
Well, we're actually talking
about design critique

91
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,430
and professional ethics.

92
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,950
One step up and whack,

93
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,170
and then I'll tell you
the key on the whack.

94
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,057
- Hit.

95
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,817
(students laugh)

96
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:59,400
- Another example is design for assembly.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,070
(students yelling indistinctly)

98
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,530
So, it's really important
when we design products

99
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,110
to think about how
they're gonna go together.

100
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,820
So, what we do is a game.

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,510
It's a game of who can put
in the fasteners fastest,

102
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,730
but each person has a different setup

103
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,940
that has different problems
related to assembly.

104
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,460
So, it makes it absolutely clear

105
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,280
how bad design for assembly choices

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,190
can impact the outcomes in your product,

107
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,510
and even in their case,

108
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,360
how easily they're gonna
get their prototype together

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,667
and take it apart when
they need to fix it.

110
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:33,720
(students yell indistinctly)

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
We're learning things

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
that we will apply in our serious work,

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,590
but we're learning them
in a way that's playful,

114
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,850
that engages us,

115
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,650
and we'll retain it.

116
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,483
- I'm done!

117
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,863
- Using play, we can
make the subject real.

118
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,292
(upbeat music)

119
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:03,291
(upbeat music continues)

120
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,259
Hello.

121
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,780
If you think of a lecture,
it's like theater.

122
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,580
Wow, it's a computer.

123
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,510
Whoa, and there's a button over here.

124
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,551
I wonder what this does.

125
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,290
(students cheering)
(machine booming)

126
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,480
You're really putting on a performance

127
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,100
in a very sincere way,

128
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,500
but one that's designed to engage

129
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,799
and draw the interest of students.

130
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,313
(David screams)

131
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:30,730
(upbeat music continues)

132
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,500
And all the silly characters,

133
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,723
they do have meaning, context.

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,380
This fish, for example, was part

135
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,453
of an environmental-like challenge.

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,850
But even more importantly,
it gives students permission

137
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,143
to feel free and exuberant in their work.

138
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,737
(upbeat music continues)

139
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:55,320
(gentle music)

140
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,450
By being playful, by being silly,

141
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,150
but still talking about serious topics,

142
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,983
what we're doing

143
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:09,120
is we're just giving
the students permission

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,610
to feel that way themselves.

145
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,880
It allows them the freedom to
say, "Hey, let's try this,"

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,270
to think of new things, to feel creative,

147
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,250
to not feel constrained

148
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,250
that they might just do something wrong.

149
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,640
Can we all learn how to do this?

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
Of course we can.

151
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,236
Like most things, it just
takes a little practice.

152
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:34,860
(gentle music continues)

153
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,050
Start with playing.

154
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,710
Find ways to combine
playfulness with what you do.

155
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,370
Perhaps there's a game-like
approach to getting a job done,

156
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,900
even doing a chore.

157
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,964
Give it a go and embrace
the power of positive.

158
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:52,770
(students chattering indistinctly)

159
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,030
And that's when you can say,
"We're playing seriously."

160
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,870
- My mom gonna see this.

161
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,499
- No, we'll...
- Guys!

162
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,101
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

163
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,973
- [Student] Whoa, whoa.

164
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,723
(David chuckles)

165
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,535
- [David] Do you wanna do the
bubble talk thing for a bit?

166
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:13,851
(David's lips smacking)

167
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:20,110
(gentle music continues)

168
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:28,741
(David's lips smacking)

169
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,476
(gentle music continues)
