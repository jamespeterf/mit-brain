1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
great thank you so much for having me

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,680
today my name is karita I'm the founder

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,679
C of the 3D architect so I'm affiliated

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,559
with the MIT visiting scientist so we

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,200
are manufacturing technology startup

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,199
located in Boston here and also s City

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
in

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,680
Japan the problems we are tackling is

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,800
about how we can enable sustainable

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,640
society and in this topic this is the

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,519
two challenges we are fac we are working

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,840
on right now the first one is that the

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,400
data center cooling power consumption so

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,160
as you have seen a lot of discussion

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,320
today data center um has other like

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,200
Demand right today and it could consume

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,760
30% of the world electricity by 2030 and

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,800
with within this 133% of electricity

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,160
consumption actually 40% comes from the

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,480
data center cooling so the heat or heat

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,640
disspation is a huge and Urgent problem

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,320
today in the data center and another

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
problem we are looking at is the green

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,760
hydrogen production in order to achieve

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,320
that net emission by 2050 we need adapt

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,080
200 million t hydrogen by 2070 however

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
the hardle here is that the cost of the

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,240
hydrogen production we need to reduce

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,080
the hydrogen cost by the fact of the

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,880
pipe by 20 stud and it looks like two

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,960
different problems here but as a

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,520
manufacturing startup we see the

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,920
underlying common issue here that the

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,600
inefficient fluid flow which comes from

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,720
actually the manufacturing um inability

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,640
to optimize the design at micrometer

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,320
scale so one of the good example is a

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,680
heat sink used for the data center

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,560
Cooling and that has a typically the fin

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,040
structure which has a 0.1 mm Fin and if

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,720
you we know that already if you can

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
decrease a fin stickness or interval

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,280
between FS we can increase surface areer

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
so that we can improve the cooling

45
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,439
performance or if you can make more

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,119
organic structure optimiz structure so

47
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,399
that we can make a more improved um

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,680
cooling performance however we don't

49
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,159
have a way to manufacture such a design

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,360
so the state of the art manufacturing

51
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,560
can only offer 0.21 mm scale of the

52
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,560
design control today and it's same for

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,119
the green hydogen production the water

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,439
electrizer is using right now the

55
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,960
randomly oriented gas division layer and

56
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,000
if you can optimize that structure we

57
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,720
can also improve the um energy

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
production on cost as well or decrease

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,040
energy production cost as well so to

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,360
tackle this challenge what we do here is

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,959
that we invented a completely new way of

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,680
making Metals which is a listography

63
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,480
based metal 3D printing and this can

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,879
offer 10 micrometer features with a

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,640
desired structure so that we can offer

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,680
ultimate performance at scale so what we

67
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,800
do here is that we use offer shelf

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,599
rography based 3D printer or any

69
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,560
rography based device that could be used

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,360
for the semiconductor manufacturing but

71
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,640
we use that machine for making Metals so

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,480
we have the pro G materials which can be

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,800
you know manufactured by that type of O

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
sh 3D printer and we make a 3D

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
structureal gel and you have the

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,959
conversion technology that can convert

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,080
from Gel to metal completely so that by

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,519
using this o shelf rography Bas printer

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,800
which is typically used for making a

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,000
raisin or plastic we can create high

81
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,959
performing metal and allo parts and we

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,840
working with a globally mulle company in

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,319
this two uh industry spaces and one of

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
the use case is that heat sink or Li

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,120
heat sink we are working with a Japan

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
heat sink manufacturer here today so

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,640
compared to the traditionally

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,400
manufactured heat sink we can offer 10

89
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,640
micr meter features with the optimized

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,640
structure so that we can offer almost

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,760
60% cut of electricity cost for the

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,120
cooling and also we can offer you know

93
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,640
by the nature of the 3D printing

94
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,599
technology the customization at low cost

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,840
and at the scale as well another example

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,879
here is that the gas diffusion layer for

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,439
the water electricity system so as you

98
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,519
see from the left pictures people use

99
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,519
this randomly oriented structure for the

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
on Division and you haven't know that

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,760
for the decades if we can control know

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,400
this structure we can improve the

103
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,879
improve the performance but today we

104
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,360
only can offer this design you know

105
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,120
basically by Design cat so that we can

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,879
manufacture the same structure in the

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,400
reality here and people select us a

108
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,519
couple of reason the one of the reason

109
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,640
is that we can improve the out output of

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,560
the green hydrogen production by 30%

111
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,239
with the same cost and also we can lower

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,840
the cost of material as a by Design and

113
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,840
also one of the interesting aspect is

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,880
that now today we can offer the Val

115
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,560
design structure so that you can tell

116
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,320
what parameter you want to chune to

117
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,320
improve the performance of the elect

118
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,000
system for example porosity po diameter

119
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,600
or any other parameters in the design

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,280
space so today we are seeking the some

121
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,160
partnership for the green hydrogen

122
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,880
production water electrizer and liid

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
cooling the example is that liquid

124
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,919
cooling heat sying or coold plate works

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
for the Vaper Chambers and imion cooling

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,199
system and also we think we are seeking

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,759
collaboration on the water electrizer

128
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,360
system and Al fuel cell as well and we

129
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,440
are transitioning to the mass production

130
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,360
scale right now so we are seeking as a

131
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,080
chemical company that can produce the

132
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,320
our G material at the scale as

133
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,080
well so we if you are interested please
