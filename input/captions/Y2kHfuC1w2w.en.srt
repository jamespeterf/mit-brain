1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,040
Welcome to the annual R&D conference. Um

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
I hope you find it interesting. We have

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,200
several tracks. So the track this

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920
morning here, track number three is

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,920
going to be about the new space economy.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,560
And so in this talk I want to give you

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,039
an overview of what that is. Uh give you

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,679
some numbers. We'll also talk about some

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,160
recent events because 2025 so far, we're

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,480
not done with 2025 yet, has been an

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,960
extraordinary year for the new space

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
economy and for all segments of it, for

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
the launch segment, for the space

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,239
segment, really for all aspects of um of

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
the new space economy. Um I'm also going

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,239
to tell you a little bit about our

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,200
research at MIT in our lab. Uh we really

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,680
look at it from a macro perspective. So

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,079
we just completed a a study of the

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,239
launch industry. Uh we looked at the

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,199
last 20 years of launches. We looked at

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,920
the statistics um the countries the

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,960
success rate. So just to give you one

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,280
number um it still is not absolutely

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,040
routine to launch to space. The overall

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,920
success rate is about 95%. So 5% of

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,400
launches still fail. However, those tend

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,479
to be uh the smaller launch vehicles and

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,680
those that don't launch as frequently as

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,000
for example the Falcon 9. Uh the other

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
uh key number that I can give you is uh

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,119
Starlink. Starlink has really been a

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,920
gamecher. Starlink launched 2,000

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,520
satellites just this year. So the total

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
uh complement of satellites in the

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Starlink constellation is now over

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,000
8,000.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,159
Um, I've actually been a user of

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,479
Starlink since the beta trials which

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
started in 2021 and I've seen the

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,200
performance of the Starlink

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,439
constellation go up consistently. Uh, my

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,439
only complaint really with Starlink is

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,119
the power consumption on the ground

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,799
terminal. The power consumption of a

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,360
Starling terminal is about uh 100 watts,

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
110 watts steady state, which is not a

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
big deal if you're wired into the

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,280
electrical grid, but it is a big deal

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,239
for mobile applications.

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,760
Great. So slides are up. Wonderful. And

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
now I just need to be able to advance

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,239
them, but maybe you could advance them

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,560
for me. Could you do that? Awesome.

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,480
Thank you. So, uh, so let's go through

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,160
some of the key events that happened

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,480
very recently. So, New Glenn um last

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,160
week had its second flight. Um and it is

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,400
really a big deal for a number of

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,720
reasons. Um the biggest the biggest um

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,120
takeaway for me is that there is more

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,680
than one way to develop uh new rockets

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,080
and new launch systems. New Glenn was

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,040
not a fast development. It took over a

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
decade to develop this rocket. uh but

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,560
having this level of success so

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,800
successful deployment of actual uh

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
satellites so the escapade mission are

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,599
twin probes to go to Mars so an

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,920
interplanetary mission um by rocket labs

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,680
rocket labs is the manufacturer of those

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,239
having a successful recovery of um you

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,319
know of the booster stage on the second

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
flight is really exceptional and so it

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,720
shows you that this kind of go it slow

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,959
and get it right approach approach is

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,280
still a valid approach to developing

78
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,000
space systems, not just let's launch

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
quickly, let's fail, let's learn and

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
let's redesign. So we have really two

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,200
different approaches to um to space

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,000
systems development. So kudos to Blue

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,879
Origin and New Glenn and a number of our

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,200
MIT students um from our department are

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
actively working on that program. The

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
next slide please. Um [clears throat]

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,360
the other um event and this is October

88
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,640
13th. So just a month ago uh Starship

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,640
had its um Starship had its 11th test

90
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,120
flight. So this is more the you know

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,519
let's launch frequently uh let's

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
understand what failures happened uh and

93
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,239
let's uh let's repair let's redesign.

94
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,040
This was the last flight of the second

95
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,080
generation of Starship. Um they deployed

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,159
eight mock Starlink satellite simulators

97
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
during the mission. The launch site is

98
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,359
also different. Uh, so Starship launched

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
from Starbase, which is, you know, it's

100
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,160
like out of a science fiction. It's

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,360
basically a a city that has sprawled up

102
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,400
from nowhere in West Texas. Um, really,

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,479
really impressive. This is the largest

104
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,440
uh rocket ever built. It's larger than

105
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,240
the Saturn 5. And it's going to have a a

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,960
capacity Dellor orbit, which is well

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,320
north of 100 metric tons. It's it's

108
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,040
really a gamecher. Um the next stage for

109
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,080
Starship will really to fully achieve

110
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,479
operational readiness. Um which then

111
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,240
also means refueling in orbit. So next

112
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,360
big challenge for the third generation

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,919
of Starship will be to uh go to orbit,

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,000
stay in orbit and then rendevous with a

115
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,720
second Starship and demonstrate uh

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,120
spacecraft to spacecraft refueling. Also

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,440
a major success. Next chart please. Um

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
uh coming back to Blue Origin um an

119
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,440
event that happened earlier this spring

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,919
in April uh the [clears throat] New

121
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,160
Shepard mission. So New Shepard is a

122
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,320
suborbital vehicle um that's been

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,960
operating for a number of years. We for

124
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,680
example had a payload on New Shepard 17

125
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,520
which was in 2021. So you can tell the

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,320
launch cadence is about you know um 6 to

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,280
10 flights per year. But what was um

128
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,440
what was remarkable about this flight uh

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,400
was it was the first all female crude

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,520
space flight since Valentina Teroskova

131
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,479
the Soviet um cosmonaut uh who had a

132
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,360
solo mission in 1963. Uh there were some

133
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,199
very illustrious women on that flight.

134
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
It also caused a lot of discussion

135
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,039
online. And uh my my take on this is

136
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,840
that if we want space tourism, we need

137
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
to embrace it in all of its forms. And

138
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
um I really applaud this mission for

139
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,479
promoting diversity and ensuring that

140
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,280
future generations remain engaged in

141
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,039
space tourism and in in this whole

142
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,440
enterprise. Uh next chart please.

143
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,639
Okay. Now let's switch gears slightly

144
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,280
and look at the evolution of cubats. So

145
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,919
uh what are cubats? Cubats are small

146
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,560
satellites. Uh the traditional cube sets

147
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:31,680
are 1 U 2 U or 3U. So 1U is a 10x 10 by

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,759
10 cm form factor and then you multiply

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,840
that by two or by three. So we're

150
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,880
talking roughly shoe box sized

151
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,160
satellites. One of the trends has been

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,160
to uh move up sort of the size scale. So

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,639
uh you'll hear from professor cooy later

154
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,000
this morning. She's launched 3U cube

155
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,240
sets. 6U and then 12U is is kind of

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,120
becoming the new standard. So uh we're

157
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,960
moving up in scale uh because at that

158
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
scale you can do more things like

159
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
propulsion uh you have more in

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,520
interesting instruments. The point of

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
this chart is this is a running total.

162
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,919
So it's cumulative number of cubats

163
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,520
launched and you could see it was a slow

164
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,400
growth slow growth until about 2013 2014

165
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,800
almost exactly 10 years ago the curve

166
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,599
starts really shifting and that has to

167
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,000
do with launch opportunities as well and

168
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,120
we're we're actually now well over 2,000

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,840
of these these cubats. However, I want

170
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,560
to point out one thing. This lower curve

171
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,960
here, this this light green curve is the

172
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
fraction of cube sets that have actual

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,599
propulsion on board. So most of these

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
cube sets because of their small factor

175
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,759
do not have propulsion. So you launch

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,759
them, they're in an orbit and then

177
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
they're subject to the pertabbations of

178
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,360
that orbit primarily drag and they will

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,960
gradually come down. Recently we've had

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
uh you know we have the 11-year solar

181
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,400
cycle. So because of the increased drag

182
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,960
during solar maximum, a lot of cubats

183
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,120
have come down sooner than expected. So

184
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
the lifetime of these cubats if they're

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,960
launched say from 400 kilometer like an

186
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,440
ISS like orbit is only a few months or

187
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,199
maximum a couple of years. However,

188
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
there are cubats that have been launched

189
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,960
in higher altitudes like the Swiss cube.

190
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,240
Um the Swiss cube was launched in 2008

191
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,879
to about 750 kilometer altitude. It's

192
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,360
still up there after you know after all

193
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,440
over 15 years. So the altitude of

194
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,319
insertion is extremely important for

195
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,839
cube sets. But look at that curve. Uh

196
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,560
next chart please. Now another thing

197
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,440
that's really changed is um if you want

198
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,760
to do your own cubat mission um how do

199
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,480
you go about this? There are there is

200
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,800
now an ecosystem a supply chain for

201
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,040
satellite components and parts that did

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,800
not exist a decade ago. An example is

203
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,279
this company here, Endurosat. Um, it's a

204
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
company from, are you ready for this?

205
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,360
Bulgaria.

206
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Endurosat is based in Bulgaria. They've

207
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,040
recently opened a US office, but uh, you

208
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
can go to their website. This is a 6U

209
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,519
cube set. We just talked about the form

210
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,320
factor. 6U cube set. Uh, and you can buy

211
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,480
hardware for cube sets like on Amazon

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,040
basically. It's incredible. There's a

213
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,360
configurator. So you can have modific no

214
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,080
modifications. You can choose a version

215
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,200
of it with ADCS mean meaning pointing

216
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,399
accuracy less than one degree less than

217
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,399
0.1 degrees. And then here's the price.

218
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,880
It's a range 153,100

219
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,880
to 284,400.

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,480
So for basically the bus and some of the

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,279
basic components, you can now buy Cubat

222
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,680
components basically off the shelf.

223
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,920
That is absolutely new and was not the

224
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,560
case a decade ago. Uh next chart please.

225
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,480
Uh okay. So we've talked about uh the

226
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,959
launch vehicles, we've talked about cube

227
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,160
sets, we've talked about c space

228
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,320
tourism. Is new space only about

229
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,080
billionaires space tourism and cube

230
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,080
sets? No, it is really an economy. So if

231
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,440
we go to the next chart, there's a

232
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,079
number of um organizations,

233
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,160
mainly consultancies that really um do a

234
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,320
a pretty good job, I would say, of

235
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
trying to capture what is the space

236
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
economy, what's in the space economy,

237
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,760
what's not in the space economy. It's

238
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,600
actually not easy to do because unlike

239
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,560
terrestrial economies, you know, like

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
agriculture or semiconductors,

241
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,680
um the space economy is kind of spread

242
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,160
out throughout the regular economy. So

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
if you're looking for those um codes

244
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,800
right there's the North American

245
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
Industry Classification Codes NAKES some

246
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
of you might be familiar with that and

247
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,600
you look for the main category called

248
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,519
space economy you will not find it

249
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,000
because the space economy is kind of

250
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,160
spread throughout nevertheless so uh

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,720
this this prediction here this is a an

252
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
organization called Nova Space uh

253
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,920
there's several of them out there their

254
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,560
estimate for 2024 last year is that the

255
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,519
total space economy globally speaking is

256
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,600
about $600 billion.

257
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,519
Um, and what does that include? It

258
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,760
includes different subsectors. So, it

259
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,120
includes satellite services for example.

260
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,079
It includes launch. Uh, PNT is precision

261
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,120
navigation and timing. So, it's a mix of

262
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,240
launch, satellite manufacturing,

263
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,920
operations, but also data services. And

264
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
especially on data services, the

265
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,560
question is how broad, you know, how far

266
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,120
downstream do you go and still count

267
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,040
that as part of the space economy. Other

268
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,640
things that are noteworthy is the growth

269
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,000
rate. So the 5-year compound annual

270
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,200
growth rate is about 7%. I've also seen

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,600
studies that claim it's about 11%. So

272
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,600
it's somewhere between 7 and 11% which

273
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
is significantly

274
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,760
higher than uh the global economy

275
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,800
overall.

276
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,760
And um it's also more than double the

277
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,079
growth rate of aviation. So just to to

278
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,480
put this in perspective uh all of

279
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,800
aviation so aircraft manufacturing,

280
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,839
airlines, airport operations, all of

281
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,600
that together is about $1.8

282
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,760
trillion globally. 600 billion is about

283
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,800
onethird. So you could just to remember

284
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,480
the space economy is about currently

285
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,440
onethird the size of aviation. However,

286
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,440
its growth rate is more than twice.

287
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
Those are kind of the big takeaways. And

288
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,279
a predict prediction here by them is

289
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,279
that by 2033

290
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,399
uh given those growth rates, we're going

291
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,760
to be very close to $1 trillion globally

292
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,760
in in that space economy. Uh next chart,

293
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,839
please. Um okay, so what is in the space

294
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,320
economy? How can we understand the

295
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
structure of the space economy? Again,

296
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,480
there's uh quite a bit of information

297
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,240
out there. I particularly like this one.

298
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,800
This is an uh interactive mind map. Um

299
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,360
uh and you can uh you can actually go

300
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,079
and click in these different sectors. So

301
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,040
at the center we have the traditional

302
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,040
government organizations NASA, issa,

303
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,320
JAXA and Japan. Um we have investors, we

304
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,000
have uh R&D centers and hubs. And then

305
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,000
uh around here we have different

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,639
companies in robotics in space services

307
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,240
uh data down linking from space

308
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
observation

309
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,480
um we have space manufacturing that's a

310
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,279
very small sector but it's growing

311
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,920
satellite communications which is uh

312
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,079
probably the most profitable and and so

313
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,800
forth. And each one of these little

314
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,440
things here is a logo of a company. some

315
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,000
very wellestablished, some are startups

316
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,639
and um and it's a very dynamic evolution

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,800
of that industry. Uh next chart,

318
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,600
next chart please.

319
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,480
Okay, so one of the trends I just wanted

320
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,959
to also make the point that uh things

321
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,600
are not static in the space economy.

322
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,440
some businesses that used to be very

323
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,680
profitable that you would say this is

324
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,480
the most profitable part of the space

325
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,360
economy have gone down and other parts

326
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,519
have gone up. So I draw here and I will

327
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I will tell you it's not always easy to

328
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,160
get accurate data. So this is an

329
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,120
estimated crossover between two

330
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,880
companies Direct TV and Starlink. So,

331
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,240
Direct TV, if you remember, their

332
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,519
business was broadcast television from

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
uh space, particularly from

334
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,560
geostationary orbit, and you put a a

335
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,839
fairly large dish on your roof and you

336
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,320
get direct TV, right? Uh and that was a

337
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
big business. It still is a kind of a

338
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,639
big business, but it's definitely

339
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,519
decreased significantly over the last

340
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,920
decade. By the way, this is 2025, so

341
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,480
everything to the right here is a uh

342
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,480
projection. The orange curve is the

343
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,160
revenues, the estimated revenues of

344
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Starlink. Uh Starlink's revenues um have

345
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,040
grown substantially. Um it's a little

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,199
bit unclear whether they are because

347
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,000
Starlink is still a privately held

348
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,839
company. Um the finances are not always

349
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,240
as clear as for publicly traded

350
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,880
companies, but we're pretty sure that

351
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
the $10 billion revenue per year

352
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,279
threshold for Starlink is is going to

353
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,920
happen very very soon if it hasn't

354
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,240
happened already. But this crossover is

355
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,120
important because what does Starlink do?

356
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,680
Starlink provides us high quality, high

357
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
bandwidth internet almost anywhere we

358
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,040
are on the globe, right? Airlines are

359
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,040
starting to have it. Uh residential uh

360
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,519
mobile users are starting to have it and

361
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,519
the quality of the service again is very

362
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,680
very consistent 150 megabits per second

363
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,639
uh at a relatively attractive price

364
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,199
point. So the point is this is a dynamic

365
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,600
industry. Next chart.

366
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,600
Um, all right. So, I told you in the

367
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,120
introduction that we recently completed

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
a um a survey, a pretty in-depth study

369
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,759
of the international space launch

370
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,360
industry. We just published that in ACTA

371
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,639
astronautica.

372
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,199
And um this is an open access article.

373
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,680
So you you have access to it for free.

374
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,839
Uh and what we show is essentially again

375
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,600
the last decade is really where a lot of

376
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,160
the action has happened. uh China is is

377
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,480
very has been very active but has really

378
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,839
been growing. The big story here is

379
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,320
Falcon 9. Falcon 9 has you know close to

380
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,639
50% of the global launch market at this

381
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,880
point but there's others as well. Russia

382
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,040
of course has been shrinking. This is

383
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,680
related to the war in Ukraine and and

384
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,800
and and the Russ the isolation

385
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,800
essentially of Russia on the

386
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,199
international stage particularly

387
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,000
commercially. uh that also affects the

388
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,720
proton launch vehicle and then Europe

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,959
has really really suffered in the last

390
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,679
decade with the retirement of the Aran

391
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,679
5. Arian 6 is now here but the launch

392
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,799
rates are very low. Uh my prediction is

393
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,199
at the current growth rate that by 2027

394
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,959
so two years from now we are going to be

395
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,959
launching to space every day.

396
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,640
We're over 250 now. So project that out

397
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,439
for a couple of years, which is not too

398
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,799
far. We're going to be over 300 launches

399
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,960
per year and very very close to once per

400
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:38,080
day to space from somewhere on this

401
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:41,039
planet by 2027. Uh next chart please.

402
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,320
Okay, so I did mention China. Um I think

403
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,520
we just need to be uh particularly in

404
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,840
the west, we need to be cognizant. We

405
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,799
need to be um aware how uh how much

406
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,919
progress China really has made not just

407
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:02,400
in uh deploying unmanned satellites but

408
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,640
also in human space flight. So Shenzu 21

409
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,720
um is the recent mission. You might have

410
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,600
heard that the astronauts, there's three

411
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,440
tyonauts we call them, are uh on the

412
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,240
station right now and they've having

413
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,480
trouble coming back to Earth because

414
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,640
their return capsule was damaged by

415
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,440
space debris. The exact nature of the

416
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,000
damage is unclear and China has recently

417
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,640
launched just a couple days ago a rescue

418
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,280
capsule to get those astronauts back. So

419
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,160
that is that is actually impressive that

420
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,559
they have that capability. Uh Long March

421
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,039
is the main workhorse rocket. You saw

422
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,520
that on the prior chart. Um they've been

423
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,200
have they had a uninterrupted human

424
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,000
presence in Earth orbit since 2021. Um

425
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,400
and uh and they have strong ambition. So

426
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,960
China has announced uh that they are

427
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,000
going to land uh tyonauts on the lunar

428
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,720
surface. They've announced a joint lunar

429
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,280
research station with uh with China,

430
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,440
China and Russia together with a nuclear

431
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,600
fision reactor providing the power on

432
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,000
the lunar surface by 2030 2035 time

433
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,919
frame. So that is very significant

434
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,200
because it shows the growth and the

435
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,440
maturation of China's capabilities in in

436
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,559
crude and uncrrewed space flight. Next

437
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,200
chart please. Okay, this is also

438
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,520
exciting and this is probably the the

439
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,919
most um recent trend. Uh you'll you'll

440
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,679
hear more about this from Professor COY,

441
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,960
but uh StarCloud 1 launched uh also this

442
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,919
month, right? This has been an

443
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,440
incredible month, right, with with um

444
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,200
New Glenn with Starship and StarCloud 1

445
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,520
launched on a Falcon 9 out of

446
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
Vandenberg. That's a third launch site,

447
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,280
right? We've talked about Texas. We've

448
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,840
talked about Cape Canaveral. This one

449
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
launched from Vandenberg in California.

450
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,280
And um this is the first satellite that

451
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,440
hosted a G um uh high performance GPU

452
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,240
from Nvidia to deliver um inspace

453
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,360
computation. As you all know, the growth

454
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,720
rate of AI, the use of uh large language

455
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,720
models like chat GPT, uh Gemini and so

456
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,120
forth has been increasing a lot. But

457
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,400
this computation is not coming for free,

458
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,039
right? You need to power it

459
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,080
electrically. You need land. You need

460
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:23,919
cooling. You need electric power. Well,

461
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,080
it turns out in space, land is kind of

462
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,320
free, right? Once you're in space, uh

463
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,640
except if you're in geostationary orbit,

464
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,679
you need to get that slot, but otherwise

465
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,280
there is no land that you need to like

466
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,159
buy or rent. So, land is kind of free.

467
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,520
Power is also free from the sun. The

468
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,240
solar constant is about 1,360

469
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,559
watts per square meter and on Earth we

470
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,679
get about 100 watts per square meter. So

471
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,360
10x more power per unit area. And then

472
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,320
cooling

473
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,000
um particularly during eclipse when your

474
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,880
satellite goes through the shadow of the

475
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,120
earth it gets very cold. So cooling can

476
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,360
be free as well. So one of the big

477
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,640
questions we have is does it make sense

478
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,360
to launch major data centers and

479
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,400
computing in space because a lot of the

480
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,720
issues and costs for having these large

481
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,480
computing centers on Earth don't exist.

482
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,320
Of course you need to launch you need to

483
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,240
operate those satellites and there's

484
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,400
plenty of issues but you're going to

485
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,120
hear a lot about this in coming years.

486
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,960
AI edge computing in space and we've

487
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,960
already had the first thesis on these

488
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,240
topics here at MIT. So, we're happy to

489
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,880
share more with you. Next chart.

490
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,159
Okay. I haven't said much about Europe

491
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,320
in this whole picture. Uh again, also

492
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,520
this month in November, in fact, next

493
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,360
week, November 26th and 27, ISA, which

494
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,640
is the European Space Agency, is going

495
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,280
to have their uh ministerial council. Um

496
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,600
the last one was in 2022.

497
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,159
And this one is going to be very

498
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,520
important uh for a couple reasons. one

499
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:05,039
is uh you've seen that European um

500
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,280
launch capacity has really um has

501
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,200
declined and the European share of the

502
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,159
global launch market has declined as

503
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,799
well and at the same time the war in

504
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,280
Ukraine has made it very clear for

505
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,480
example because of the use of Starlink

506
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,960
on the front lines that having uh your

507
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,720
own satellites having your own capacity

508
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,280
in space is really important for

509
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,960
national security. So for the very first

510
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,919
time, ISSA at the ministerial level is

511
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,559
going to discuss the role of ISA in dual

512
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,840
use technologies and this might actually

513
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,880
require a change to ISSA's charter

514
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,640
because founded purely for civilian

515
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
purposes. So this is going to be

516
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
something really interesting to watch

517
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,120
toward the end of this month. Next

518
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,240
chart, please. Okay. So the other point

519
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,360
I want to make here is let's not call it

520
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,720
new space and old space right old space

521
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,559
is a bit sort of peorative but this new

522
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,360
space economy that we're talking about

523
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,720
and let's call it traditional space they

524
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,919
both coexist so they're like two cogs

525
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,880
working together um we will still have

526
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,360
large spacecraft programs we're still

527
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,480
using geostationary satellites you know

528
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,320
those large van or Even school bus size

529
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
satellites, they're not going to go

530
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,000
away. We're still going to have them.

531
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,480
There still is a role for geostationary

532
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,880
satellites. There still is a role for

533
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,440
satellites in medium-ear orbit. Those

534
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,679
are the 12-hour orbits that are used by

535
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,919
say GPS or Galileo. And um Newspace is

536
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,320
injecting though innovation into this

537
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,640
traditional market and in some cases

538
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,880
disrupting it and in other cases

539
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,400
complementing it. Next chart.

540
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,720
Okay, so here's a way to maybe visualize

541
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
uh the difference between traditional

542
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,440
space and new space. On the left in

543
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,640
blue, we have the traditional approach

544
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,280
to space. An agency or an institution,

545
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,080
usually always a government, issues a

546
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,640
call for tender or request for proposal

547
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,120
and that tender imposes requirements.

548
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,919
Companies re respond with proposals to

549
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,799
that call for tender. Uh a winner is

550
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,480
declared, the work is performed. um

551
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,559
revenue is earned through milestone

552
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,400
payments and then you repeat right

553
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,360
that's kind of a linear process on the

554
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,240
right side we have those six pillars of

555
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,400
the new space business product process

556
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,320
the funding model the business model the

557
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,799
technology and the market and what's

558
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,760
really interesting is to look at what is

559
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,480
the starting point some comp new space

560
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,360
companies they have you know IP they

561
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,000
have new technology uh in communications

562
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,799
in quantum encryption whatever it is

563
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
that's their starting point. Others uh

564
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,559
they start with the business model for

565
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,880
example a transcript or subscription

566
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:01,039
type service um in the as a BTOC market.

567
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Starlink is essentially a subscription

568
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:08,240
service and it's clearly a BTOC business

569
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,039
direct to consumer market. So um very

570
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,440
very different. Next chart.

571
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,080
All right. So are there this sounds

572
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,919
interesting large growth over the last

573
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,000
decade. So is there are there any issues

574
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,880
are there any problems? And the answer

575
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,360
is yes. Uh the biggest issue we're

576
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,080
worried about right now is uh the the

577
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,679
rapid growth of the resident space

578
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,600
object population RSO population. This

579
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,120
has been growing even faster than the

580
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,200
number of launches than the number of

581
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,240
satellites. And so you can see this

582
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,799
colored curve shows you the tracked.

583
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,640
These are only the space objects we're

584
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,279
currently actively tracking. There's

585
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,799
about 30,000 of them. And you can see

586
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,279
which countries they come from

587
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,679
originally, US, Russia, China, and then

588
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,840
the others. And you can see some big

589
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,440
jumps. Uh and these big jumps happen

590
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,200
either because there was an

591
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,679
anti-satellite test. We the US by the

592
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,159
way we do criticize other countries for

593
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,159
doing anti-satellite tests but we are

594
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
the first ones who demonstrated it. So

595
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,039
we have to keep that in mind. There have

596
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,440
been five anti-satellite tests so far

597
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,039
and uh every one of those tests creates

598
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,320
an enormous debris cloud that is really

599
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,640
uh a problem. Um and then the other is

600
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,640
accidental collisions between satellites

601
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,200
or debris in satellites. The most famous

602
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,880
of these is the Iridium cosmos collision

603
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,360
that happened uh back in 2008.

604
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,440
Um so we need to do a better job

605
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,240
tracking this population. Next chart

606
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,960
please. Um and so we're doing some

607
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,360
research uh in my group uh together with

608
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,679
DARPA and Lincoln Lab on um the sensors

609
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,679
for tracking space objects. Primarily

610
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,840
we're talking about ground radar and

611
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,720
we're talking about uh optical sensors

612
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,200
as well as inspace sensors. What is the

613
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,120
value of getting more and more and more

614
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,279
sensor sensor data? Uh we believe that

615
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,159
in order to quantify the marginal

616
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,080
utility of these sensors, you need to go

617
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,600
all the way to decision making. So

618
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,880
specifically we're looking at the

619
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,360
maneuvering decisions for uh for

620
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,760
collision avoidance. Since Aridium

621
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,679
Cosmos the number of collision warnings

622
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,279
that operators are getting has just

623
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,320
skyrocketed

624
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,799
and um the question is

625
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,799
will if you get more information about

626
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,440
potential collisions and conjunctions

627
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,159
will you change your threshold at which

628
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,000
you will maneuver next chart. And and

629
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,039
that's really what we're looking at.

630
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Here's here's a nominal threshold. So if

631
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,080
if the risk the probability of collision

632
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
is above this threshold, you would

633
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,840
maneuver and if it's below the

634
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,960
threshold, you would not maneuver. The

635
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,520
tricky part is and you can think of this

636
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,240
as two ellipsoids intersecting with each

637
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,720
other that um there there's what's

638
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,960
called the diluted region. So if the

639
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,159
uncertainty is very large, you can

640
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,720
calculate a low probability of collision

641
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,080
but it's not because it's actually low

642
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,760
but it's because you have poor

643
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,240
knowledge. So the ellipsoids of

644
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,080
uncertainty are very large. So you want

645
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,960
to make sure that whatever decision you

646
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,120
make you are not doing it because of a

647
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,600
lack of knowledge but you're doing it in

648
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,919
the what we call the robust region. And

649
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,399
I want to point out um Chris Tomla who's

650
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,279
a major in the US Air Force is doing his

651
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,960
PhD uh currently on on this topic. Next

652
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,840
chart.

653
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,159
So that's space traffic management. Of

654
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,039
course the other uh thing we have to do

655
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,399
is catalog maintenance. uh the catalog

656
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,640
of space objects is growing like we said

657
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,200
and uh we've shown with uh particularly

658
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,600
for geocynchronous orbit that there

659
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,120
could be a lot of value in observing not

660
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,679
just from earth but also having

661
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,320
observers in lower earth orbit looking

662
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,559
up at geo and uh and basically getting

663
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,279
much more frequent and much more um

664
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,960
accurate updates on our population in

665
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:17,919
geocynchronous orbit. Next chart. We're

666
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,080
almost there. The last point I feel an

667
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,919
obligation to also tell you about this.

668
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,159
Um, we talked a lot about the commercial

669
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,000
aspects of space, the scientific aspects

670
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:33,039
of space. But, you know, despite I think

671
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,600
a desire to keep space reserved purely

672
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,240
for commercial and scientific purposes,

673
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,000
I think we have to be we have to be

674
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,320
realistic about what's actually

675
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,320
happening. uh space is becoming

676
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,360
increasingly contested and there's

677
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,919
adversarial events like uh for for sure

678
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,480
the anti-satellite tests. So uh you see

679
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:58,000
the five ASAT tests that have happened

680
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:01,440
1985 the US 2007 China 2008 the US again

681
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,960
2019 India and 2021 Russia uh that

682
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,799
that's the most hostile aggressive type

683
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
of interaction in space so therefore

684
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,520
it's on the right side uh and then the

685
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,000
international space station on the blue

686
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,320
side is the most symbiotic kind of

687
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,480
interaction we've had and there's a

688
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,799
whole spectrum in between. So, we've

689
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,200
been working also with Lincoln Labs on

690
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,360
wargaming in space. Um, the picture that

691
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,360
you see there is, uh, Major Michael

692
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,200
Jones, who graduated last year with his

693
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,039
PhD, developed a um, it's essentially a

694
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,039
strategic game. It's a computer game

695
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,679
that you can play between a blue and a

696
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,039
red player, human versus human, AI

697
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,240
versus human, or AI versus AI. And it's

698
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,240
really interesting. This is uh, way more

699
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,320
complex. Think of this as chess in

700
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,080
space. But there are three big

701
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,760
differences with playing chess. In

702
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,679
chess, when you move a piece, it stays

703
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,679
there unless you move it again. In

704
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
space, all the pieces are moving all the

705
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,880
time because of orbital dynamics.

706
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,559
Secondly, in chess, you can only move

707
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,720
one piece at a time, right? When it's

708
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,720
your turn. Here, you can move multiple

709
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,640
pieces at once. And thirdly, in chess,

710
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,960
say uh queen takes rook, you when you do

711
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,440
that move, you know the outcome. Here

712
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,440
the outcome is uh uncertain and there's

713
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,000
probabilistic outcomes. So it's

714
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,120
significantly more complex than

715
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,039
traditional chess. Okay, so I think I'm

716
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,080
at the end here. Next chart. Uh I just

717
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,640
want to do if you allow me a little uh

718
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,880
plug here for our course uh through MIT

719
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,320
professional education. It's called the

720
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,120
new space economy. Um I co-e this course

721
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,360
course with professor Alessandro Golkar

722
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,679
who's a professor of space systems at TU

723
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,399
Munich. So what's good about it is he

724
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,200
sort of brings the European perspective.

725
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,720
I bring more of the US perspective and

726
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,960
the course has been offered for about

727
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,039
three years now and we've gotten really

728
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,840
good feedback and we keep refreshing it

729
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:08,840
because as you can see this is a very

730
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,840
very rapidly evolving uh domain.
