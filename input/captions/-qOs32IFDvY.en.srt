1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,759
So to address both of these problems um

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,720
we'll be now diving into uh the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,080
technologies and how um by using these

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,360
technologies we can generate data and um

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119
that data can help us um answer those

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,800
questions.

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,279
And so um the first uh technology that

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,039
we'll be talking about is um a

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,000
technology called single cell RNA

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,080
sequencing. uh this emerged in the last

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,200
uh decade or so and has really

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,280
revolutionized our ability um to

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,680
understand cell biology um and um

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
understand disease.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
The second problem is that we know how a

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,760
few of these genes worked like for

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,920
example um we learned that PDGFRA is

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,239
important for cell division. So if you

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,600
delete this gene then the padypipes

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,160
won't proliferate anymore. um and adipo

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,079
Q um is very important for the adiposite

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,600
population and so maybe if we delete

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,920
this gene then we'll see um less less uh

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,560
productive signaling between adapose

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,320
tissue and other tissues. Um but the

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,119
question is um can we learn for all the

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,439
remaining genes uh out of the 20,000 or

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,720
so genes in our genome what they too are

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,119
doing? Um and if we had a uh technology

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,799
that would allow us to uh delete these

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
other genes and then see what the impact

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,479
is on the cells um then that would

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,720
really help us uh towards this goal. And

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,720
so in parts B and C we'll be talking

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,640
about technologies that um really

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,439
address this first challenge of

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,600
measuring uh every gene in every cell to

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,400
understand um which genes are switched

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,880
on or off uh in which cells. uh and

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,960
secondly uh perturbing these genes or

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,000
deleting these genes to see what happens

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,479
to the cells um when um um those genes

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
are deleted. So talking about the first

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,360
technology which we used to measure gene

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
expression in cells uh this is a

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,759
technology called uh single cell RNA

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,879
sequencing. Um it's really

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,440
revolutionized our uh ability to do uh

49
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,440
cell biology and to understand um the

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,520
cellular states that uh drive disease.

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,560
And so um to simply put um what happens

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,800
with single cell RNA sequencing is that

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,680
um you start with a population of cells

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,239
of interest um and from these you can

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,959
measure in every single cell the uh

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,879
activity level of every single gene. Um

57
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,000
and so uh the output um that you get is

58
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,239
this kind of matrix uh where uh every

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,560
row is a different gene uh and every

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,640
column is a different cell. Um so you

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,680
would have maybe 20,000 genes for every

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,560
gene in the genome. Um and however many

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,120
cells uh you profile um in that

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,519
experiment. So for one of the data sets

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,640
uh in the uh first crunch, this is

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,080
roughly 150,000.

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Um and then uh each value tells us um

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,480
how many um uh RNA molecules or in other

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,080
words how active every gene is in each

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,760
of these different cells.

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,640
And so um going back to uh some of the

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,360
cell populations and uh programs that

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
we're interested in um if this is the

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,560
the the pool of cells that we perform

75
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,799
single cell RNA seek on what we might

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,200
see when we look at the resulting matrix

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:38,000
is um that the genes PDGFRA and thigh 1

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,239
are uh switched on in these two first

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,319
cells and so probably then these two

80
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,560
first cells are priiposytes.

81
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,640
And we might also see that the genes

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,519
adipo Q and FAB P4 are switched on in

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,120
these uh four subsequent cells. Um and

84
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,400
so we might conclude from that that

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,879
these cells 3 to six are uh classic

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
adiposytes.

87
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,920
And finally we might see that these two

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,560
lipogenic markers S surbp and fast n are

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,360
specifically switched on in a subset of

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,519
the adiposytes. um in the last two cells

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,040
five and six. And so we might say that

92
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,359
these are particularly uh lipogenic uh

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,400
cells among the larger adiposite

94
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,080
population. And so uh as I mentioned we

95
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,720
can profile hundreds of thousands of

96
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,040
cells um with this technology. And

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,680
actually uh this is very exciting

98
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:39,199
because uh the last um 15 years or so um

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,080
since the very first uh single cell RNA

100
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,040
seek technology um was published has

101
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,160
seen enormous growth and so we went from

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:53,120
uh a case where uh in 2009 four cells in

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,520
uh a four- stage uh blastoir were

104
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,160
sequenced. So in the matrix on the

105
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,720
previous page there were just uh four

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,960
columns um to uh today uh this is the

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,320
logarithmic scale and showing the number

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,520
of cells uh to the case where uh today

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,280
or at least eight years ago um we in

110
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,639
2017 we now have technologies that allow

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
us to profile uh 1 million cells.

112
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,360
And so now um I'll switch gears a little

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,759
bit and tell you about um how this

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,039
single cell RNA seek um experiment

115
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,360
actually works. Um this isn't uh

116
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,800
information that you'll directly need to

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,560
to um um do the challenges but it's very

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,479
helpful uh I think for you to

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
understand.

120
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,639
And so what we start from is a

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
population of cells. So this can either

122
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,840
be uh cells that are found in a piece of

123
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,560
tissue or cells that we've already grown

124
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,720
uh in a dish in the lab.

125
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Um and cells tend to interact and to

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,320
communicate. And so the first step is to

127
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,840
actually um go from this population to a

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,960
dissociated um version of this

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,000
population where um every cell uh is no

130
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:13,120
longer kind of attached to other cells.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Um and um we then uh take these cells

132
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,120
and isolate them one by one and for each

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:23,120
of them we can then count um how many of

134
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,199
each uh genes uh corresponding RNA

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,199
molecules are found uh in that

136
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,120
particular cell.

137
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,560
So it's this workflow again where we

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,400
start from a a kind of population of

139
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,759
cells um dissociate them and then one by

140
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,000
one um are able to measure the RNA

141
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
molecules inside each of those therefore

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
telling us about the genes which are

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,680
active there uh and the gene expression

144
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
programs in particular which are

145
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,080
expressed

146
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,919
um and so uh I'll tell you a little bit

147
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
more now about this isolation step and

148
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,280
how that works.

149
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,639
So um basically what happens is we have

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,720
this micrfluidic system and uh cells are

151
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,639
flown in through here uh into this

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,520
chamber uh and then they become

153
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,000
encapsulated in individual um water

154
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,560
droplets and what you can see is that um

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,520
in each of these water droplets uh along

156
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
with the cell uh you also have a uh

157
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,880
colored bead that's encapsulated with

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,280
it. Um, and this colored bead um will

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,520
act as a barcode so that um um we'll be

160
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,080
able to tell for all of the RNA

161
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,960
molecules inside every cell uh which

162
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,000
barcode it had. So for example, this

163
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,000
cell three here has uh these four RNA

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,479
molecules which are shown in red uh

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,080
because this cell was encapsulated uh

166
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,240
with the red bead and so that um uh bead

167
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,360
allowed us to barcode these individual

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,520
uh RNA molecules.

169
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,599
Okay, so that's this uh method for

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
isolating cells. And the reason that we

171
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,400
want to isolate the cells is so that we

172
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,400
can individually uh barcode all of the

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,759
RNA transcripts that come from a

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,240
particular cell with that barcode.

175
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,240
And now we can go back to our overall uh

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
workflow where we've um done the

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,280
dissociation, the isolation, um the

178
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,319
labeling of the RNA molecules. And what

179
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,039
actually happens now is um the the

180
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,599
reverse of what typically uh happens uh

181
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,960
in the central dogma in biology which is

182
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,240
uh where DNA uh is transcribed and

183
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,240
produces RNA. So here we actually do the

184
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,039
reverse process a process called reverse

185
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,159
transcription where we go from the RNA

186
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:43,599
and for each RNA molecule we uh convert

187
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,920
it um to uh the corresponding DNA

188
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,120
molecule. Uh and we do this for two

189
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,480
reasons. Um firstly mainly we do this

190
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,080
because um DNA is very stable and RNA is

191
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,959
not. Um and secondly this then allows us

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,399
to actually amplify these molecules uh

193
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,519
of DNA. Um and so we have a much larger

194
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,839
pool of uh DNA molecules uh that kind of

195
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,399
accurately represent the uh proportions

196
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,640
of RNA molecules um that we originally

197
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,480
detected.

198
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,120
And once we have um these uh DNA

199
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
molecules, we can then do sequencing,

200
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
which is basically saying for every

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,640
single one of these DNA sequences um

202
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
going through and seeing um which of the

203
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,800
four letters uh in the genetic code, A,

204
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,360
C, T, and G are at that position uh in

205
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,279
each DNA sequence.

206
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
And so why is that helpful? What do we

207
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,880
then do with this kind of sequencing

208
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,640
library? Well, um we now have uh the

209
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,000
human genome project. This was completed

210
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,279
in 2003 and this was a really uh amazing

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,720
effort um that uh produced the sequence

212
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,839
of every gene in the human body. And so

213
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,720
um now we have these sequences uh of DNA

214
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,279
that correspond um to scrap that bit. Um

215
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,839
and so now we have uh these sequences of

216
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,760
DNA. What we can do is we can actually

217
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
go back to the um human genome and find

218
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,800
out which uh gene each of these

219
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,800
sequences comes from.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,240
And so once we've done that um we can

221
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,800
now count um within this sequencing

222
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,200
library how many sequences we see

223
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,880
corresponding to each of these genes uh

224
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,440
in the human genome. Um and yes, so this

225
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,000
is the expression matrix or the output

226
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,120
of the single cell RNA seek uh

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,760
experiment that we've uh seen already um

228
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,600
and is kind of the main data structure

229
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,839
um that you'll be working with through

230
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,079
these crunches.

231
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:55,040
So um just a couple more uh things to be

232
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
aware of with these matrices. Um so

233
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
first of all just to reiterate you know

234
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
every row is a different gene and every

235
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,040
column is a different cell um and then

236
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,640
the values represent the activity level

237
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,760
of that gene in that cell. And so uh but

238
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,839
one issue with these matrices um with

239
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,720
the output of the single cell RNA seek

240
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,360
experiments um is that they tend to be

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,600
quite sparse uh meaning that there are

242
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,680
many entries here where the value is

243
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,560
actually uh zero and um this is a bit

244
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,440
complicated because um in those cases we

245
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,560
can't actually distinguish um between

246
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,519
two interpretations one being uh

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,600
biological but um in reality

248
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,480
uh this gene is actually zero in the

249
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,160
cell. Uh and one being just technical

250
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,040
that that gene was uh not detected um at

251
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,360
high enough abundance um to be captured

252
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,399
uh in the experiment.

253
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,959
And so uh basically uh the kind of

254
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,760
pre-processing uh in this bionformatics

255
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,079
pipeline involves uh dealing with this

256
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,320
issue.

257
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,000
And so uh this is typically how we deal

258
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,680
with that. um we want to remove uh cells

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,120
that have too many zeros and therefore

260
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,079
seem low quality. And so um what you see

261
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,880
here on the x-axis is uh the cell

262
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,279
basically ordered by this ranking of um

263
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,279
how many uh genes have a value of zero

264
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,959
in that cell. This is uh what we

265
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,040
typically call the number of detected

266
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,320
genes.

267
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,959
um and on the uh y-axis so on the x axis

268
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,040
is this rank of the cells and on the y-

269
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,600
axis is uh the number of genes that were

270
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,399
detected. So the number of nonzero genes

271
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,920
um and so what we tend to do is to uh

272
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,120
remove uh this lower tail uh of cells

273
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,920
that have uh too few genes detected um

274
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,880
and so are probably not very helpful for

275
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,360
uh downstream analysis.

276
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,440
Um and this is another issue now but we

277
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,760
actually also tend to remove the cells

278
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,399
which are at the top end um of this

279
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,959
because uh often these have a

280
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,279
suspiciously uh high number of genes

281
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,920
detected in the cell. Um and what that

282
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,480
suggests is that uh the isolation step

283
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,760
that we spoke about previously

284
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,600
is actually not fully working. Um, and

285
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,760
maybe rather than an individual cell

286
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,240
being in one of those water droplets, we

287
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,959
actually have uh two or multiple cells

288
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,920
in there. Um, so we remove these two

289
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,399
ends uh and we're left with um these

290
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,200
high quality cells uh in the middle here

291
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,920
for our analysis.

292
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:40,240
Okay. So um this is how we deal with um

293
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,720
the lowquality cells uh in the data.

294
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,120
And then there is also a second issue

295
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,600
that we have to deal with which is that

296
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
the total number of uh RNAs that we

297
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,720
count in individual cells uh might be

298
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,880
different from cell to cell. So uh in

299
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,360
other words some cells might have um

300
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,199
higher overall uh gene expression but

301
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,560
this is actually just uh because of

302
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:06,000
technical reasons. Um and so we'd like

303
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,279
to uh normalize for that. Um and so what

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,880
we do is we uh scale the gene expression

305
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:16,000
per cell such that um it sums to a

306
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,560
100,000 which is roughly how many uh

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,040
molecules of RNA we might expect a given

308
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,279
cell to have and then um we uh add a

309
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,199
pseudo count of one uh and then log

310
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,480
transform the data um so that our uh

311
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,399
distribution is uh Gaussian um and this

312
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
makes things much easier for uh

313
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
downstream analysis.

314
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,519
And then finally uh in this third step

315
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,920
we now have normalized cells only

316
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,320
highquality cells. We can project these

317
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,440
cells onto a uh lower dimensionality

318
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,720
embedding. And so this is uh one way um

319
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
using for example UMAP or TSN um that we

320
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,000
typically uh visualize um the single

321
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,600
cell RNA seek uh data set and the kind

322
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
of global diversity um uh of cells that

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,720
we see there. And so going back um to um

324
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,160
our particular use case uh this is uh

325
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,399
one of the data sets that you'll be

326
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,160
working with um an example of this lower

327
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,720
dimensional um embedding of the cells.

328
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,839
Um and you can see here um that we've

329
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,320
marked uh which of the cells are um

330
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,720
paddypoytes uh and which of the cells

331
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
are adiposytes. Um and again we've done

332
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,880
this because now that we have the single

333
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,959
cell RNA seek data we can actually go

334
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,279
and see which genes are expressed in

335
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,839
which cells and what we find is that the

336
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,399
classical uh gene markers of the

337
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,959
priiposytes as well as other genes in

338
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,600
the priiposite program are expressed in

339
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,519
these cells while the classical markers

340
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,199
of the uh adiposite population um adipoq

341
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,560
and fab

342
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,959
um as well as other adiposite um uh

343
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,959
markers. is uh expressed in this pink

344
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,959
population.
