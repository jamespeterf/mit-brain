1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,240
and um you'll remember probably it's all

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,760
gone because it's like what a week ago

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,840
uh P at 4 was mostly about the topic of

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,199
equivalence classes

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,199
equivalence in

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,119
music what were some of the things that

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,359
we were talking about back then cuz this

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,160
is just going to keep coming up all

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,480
semester what are some things that we

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,000
could say in some context that two notes

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,960
or two pitches are different but in

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,360
another context we might say they're

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
equivalent to each other yeah OCT

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,239
octaves great let's just let's just

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,960
shoot out perut

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,039
permutation

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,760
cardinality transposition inversion and

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,559
the one that's not part of the optic

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,680
spelling good good where uh just while I

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,960
put some things on the board shout out

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,160
some more things we talked about in

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,680
class that we didn't put on the problem

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,680
set what were some other things that we

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,920
s say things are the same even though

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,759
they might sound

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,680
different instrumentation

27
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,240
instrumentation yeah we s say hey that

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,000
note's a c and it's like no that note

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,159
was on a on a piano and this one was on

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,520
a trumpet good other

31
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:25,640
things and harmonics and harmonics yep

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,840
that goes with as a special class of

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,759
spelling good good but it's good to use

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,520
that term else

35
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,040
so I said it doesn't matter how long the

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,040
note is it's still a c right yeah so

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,720
duration when we're talking about notes

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,240
good good so uh I can't apparently lead

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
a discussion and write things on the

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,600
board but I want to talk about two

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
things that uh came up a lot um one of

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,520
them I don't need notation for and one

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,920
of them I do one of them is much better

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,759
B Sharp for to I don't know it doesn't

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,479
really matter but it's FP 5 you were

46
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,039
asked to write a pro prr to

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,039
automatically generate the interval um

48
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,280
on well sorry you were asked to write a

49
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,080
program to automatically generate the

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,120
interval of anything and this was one of

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,319
my hidden test cases that um I think

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,680
it's the only problem that over half

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,959
maybe three qus of the class uh the

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,200
problem uh came up with what's which one

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:29,400
of these two notes is the problematic

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:33,879
one take a guess B good good now BP is a

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,080
problematic note the way Esh is right

58
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,640
but it also has its own special

59
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,480
problematic things what what's bsharp 4

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
what note does that sound

61
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,920
like C5

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,519
good

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,280
so the issue that came up a lot um is

64
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,280
the only thing what what should this

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,720
interval be let's let's think about that

66
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,360
first what should the interval

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,720
be yeah diminished fifth diminished

68
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,920
fifth so let's think about that

69
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,440
diminished fifth good yeah what's what

70
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,239
would be the interval if it was C5 to

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,239
F

72
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,720
5

73
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,879
anybody augment

74
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,400
augmented fourth good so the four and

75
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:28,400
the five are changed around based on uh

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,840
the number of distances in the step

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,080
spacing which you all did great on um

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,159
but now we have a different problem and

79
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:43,400
so what came up a lot um from various

80
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:47,840
things I saw a lot of um D D D D D D D D

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,120
D is that the right number D D D um

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,480
12th I think that might that might not

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:58,040
be enough D's because the issue is that

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,519
the BP is something that sounds in kind

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,280
of octave five but it's not so always

86
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
when you're thinking of you know how's

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
your screwy Prof going to try to screw

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,159
you up think about these things that

89
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,640
cross over the boundaries between

90
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,760
octaves or sound like one thing not the

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,280
other um a lot of a lot of times what

92
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,359
what happened was you needed to do

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,799
something mod 12 at a certain point add

94
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,520
an offset depending on how your

95
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:27,759
algorithm works and then mod 12 it again

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,400
so this sort of double mod 12 at this

97
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,560
point we're we're going to be working

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,039
for algorithms that get things right we

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,560
can work on efficient algorithms as sort

100
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,880
of um you know more efficient ones as

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,680
kind of a project later good the second

102
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,000
one that came up um had to do with

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,120
asking you to uh This was done by hand

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,360
um to come up with a pitch set that was

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,400
equivalent to the one I gave you using p

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,880
permutation and T transposition but

107
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,360
without octave inversion or cardinality

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,360
um equivalence and most of you are like

109
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,840
I don't even want to think about

110
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,600
inversional um you know equivalent so

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,120
that's good and cardinality equivalence

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,240
just means that I gave you three notes

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,400
how many notes should you have three

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,720
three good good so the hard part so this

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,960
was A4 E5 C

116
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,639
4 what I'd like you to do when you have

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,600
a problem like this is go back to do it

118
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,680
the oldfashioned way first get out staff

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,919
paper or use finale Muse score whatever

120
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,120
you're using and try to make sure that

121
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,240
you're seeing what the notes are so

122
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,440
where's A4

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:44,240
go stop two stop stop okay good

124
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,240
A4 what's the next one

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,280
E5 stop okay good go slower puff right

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and then what's the next

127
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,319
one

128
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,759
C four

129
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:03,600
right stop

130
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,720
what's the common name we would call to

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,720
this If This Were a

132
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,199
chord A major first inversion in first

133
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,720
inversion yeah so oops I got to jle this

134
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,039
otherwise was blood red yes first

135
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,759
inversion um okay so then what you need

136
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,039
to do you want to do is something

137
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
that and it had to use both now you I

138
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,840
think I tried to say it in such a way

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,680
that even an MIT student wouldn't be

140
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,800
allowed to say well you know uh not

141
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,440
arranging anything is not rearranging

142
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,000
anything is a permutation and

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,680
transposition by Perfect Unison is a

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,080
transposition but you needed to change

145
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,120
them in some way so one of the things

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,360
you could do uh so one of the things

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,360
that happened a lot was that the octaves

148
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,280
got changed and so that ended up being

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,280
about 40% of the errors that we saw so

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,360
you can do is you could first re permute

151
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,199
things and probably the rep permutation

152
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,120
that I would do first is let's just put

153
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,360
it in ascending order so that's probably

154
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,599
the permutation you'd like to um have

155
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,800
your computer do

156
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,039
anyhow and then let's just shift

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,520
everything up um one way you can do it

158
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,560
well in this one you I was going to say

159
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,440
shift everything up a space or a line

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,000
but the E is the problem so let's just

161
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,560
transpose up a a major second what are

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,960
we going to get

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,960
here dsharp

164
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,280
B FP good not um because well no this

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,639
one we had implicitly because everything

166
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,319
on this we had spelling or and that's an

167
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:44,479
S not a five a spelling equivalent so

168
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:49,479
yeah so D Shar 4

169
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:52,120
B4 and F five so um when you get that

170
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,800
back that's there any other questions on

171
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,800
problem set

172
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,120
four hardest programming problem set so

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,159
far no no two two was harder for some

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,680
people anyone vote for one no okay if if

175
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,720
if one was the hardest uh probably

176
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,560
you're not here uh now um but sorry I

177
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,919
shouldn't yeah um but yeah so prom set

178
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,120
six will be announcing today it is also

179
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,280
a slight programming one uh it's

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,280
designed to give you a little bit of a

181
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,240
break and it you'll I'll talk about it

182
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,879
in a bit but it's uh more of a um the

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,960
only sort of participation grade type of

184
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,960
problem set than uh trying to get the

185
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,399
exact results so we're going to have a

186
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,839
little bit of a break um coming up for

187
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,159
things somebody want to volunteer what

188
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:44,480
electronic corpora did you find

189
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,320
online Adam yeah we did musipedia

190
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,360
musipedia great what's what is that it's

191
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,040
a dual database and search query

192
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,320
data cor cool great another another

193
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,480
group yeah uh we did ultimate guitar

194
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,959
ultimate guitar great how's how's that

195
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,240
that encoded um I mean they started off

196
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,880
with just like text um ask key guitar

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,800
tab but then they kind of expanded and

198
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,360
Incorporated more advanced software oh

199
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,839
cool yeah I remember when it was a lot

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,760
of asky guitar tabs I think everybody

201
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,320
had their own parser for the ultimate

202
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,360
guitar at some point uh good uh anybody

203
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
else

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,800
Vanessa video game music database video

205
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,519
game music database fantastic great

206
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,399
great repository what's what were things

207
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,160
mostly encoded for that almost

208
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,079
everything was in min5 almost everything

209
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,600
was in mini files why why do you think

210
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,440
that was I think it's like generally a

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,920
standard and it's relatively small file

212
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,760
sizes so it's easier to like Mass pop a

213
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,200
whole bunch of different it is also

214
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,760
that's probably how they were encoded in

215
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,360
a lot of especially the early video

216
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
games they were encoded so when you're

217
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,720
ripping from or something like that uh

218
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
but definitely not encoding Sharps and

219
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,519
flats good one last one Su your group oh

220
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
um we did a jazz it was a jazz database

221
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,760
a jazz database fantastic fantastic what

222
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,399
werein coding for that um they had a

223
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
variety they had like the transcribed

224
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,399
sheet music for a lot of jazz solos and

225
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,240
then also a CSV file that just had every

226
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,560
notes offset from the very beginning and

227
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,120
its pitch as a number cool uh what

228
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,120
you'll find is a lot of um a lot of

229
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,560
these data sets they really have their

230
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,279
own sort of oneoff make your own format

231
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,880
because like I I don't think that that

232
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,959
one's a standard but I've seen lots of

233
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,320
these because um that's how uh things

234
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,800
things uh you know tend to tend to go

235
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
great uh where we're going to get to

236
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,760
right back to

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,839
representation uh in just a bit uh we' a

238
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,880
special guest Michael good who knows a

239
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,920
little something about representations

240
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,079
being the creator of Music XML and uh

241
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,800
sort of uh found and BR Bell also from

242
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,079
the Dean's office um and um and so if if

243
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,240
you guys can stick around for 10 minutes

244
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,040
we're I'd like to before we do that

245
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,800
let's get sort of warmed up for probably

246
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,959
the thing that are on some people's mind

247
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,040
right the downgraded midterm which is

248
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,160
now I'm calling quiz because I'd like to

249
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,200
divide this into two smaller low lower

250
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,639
stress things and that will be on

251
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,040
Wednesday uh we'll start recording about

252
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,880
uh 30 40 minutes in I'm designing it to

253
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,200
take 30 minutes if we take a little bit

254
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,440
longer that's okay it's not all about

255
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,839
the rush but we will do one type of

256
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:25,160
thing um that uh is about sort of recall

257
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:27,240
so the um the the the quiz will be not

258
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,800
about your programming skills but about

259
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,760
the reading and we want I want the

260
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,760
quizzes to be more about the readings so

261
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,920
that you keep thinking about ideas that

262
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,279
you're going to be doing in your

263
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,000
projects as we uh keep going with uh

264
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,279
further um with further problem sets

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,120
each one of them will start having a

266
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,519
little bit of uh what do we call it uh

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,839
sort of assign yourself your own um your

268
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,399
own problem and start it okay we got

269
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
some sound going we don't really need

270
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,839
that but we can turn that down for a bit

271
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,160
who's done cahoot

272
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,320
before okay who knew that MIT apparently

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,040
let their cahoot subscription uh lapse

274
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,200
uh sometime between the last time I'm in

275
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,000
here so I'm only able to do 10 players

276
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,199
so can you all uh can you all pair up

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,040
and do in teams with the other I know I

278
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,199
know I I I was trying to fill out the

279
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,480
subscription form right behind class so

280
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,880
can you team up one two three three

281
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,040
three four five six seven eight actually

282
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,639
you can be your own team n or do you

283
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,680
want to do it with Michael stu okay we

284
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,440
might have one more thing do it okay oh

285
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,360
yeah uh use any nickname you want just

286
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,360
make it family

287
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,480
safe oh you can you can decide if you

288
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
want to

289
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,279
be

290
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,240
okay so this is ju this is just to judge

291
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,519
how much time you feel like you might

292
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,399
need to spend reviewing uh the things

293
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,639
okay we have 1 two 3 four we have

294
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:06,399
nickname nickname too great

295
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
um five

296
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,600
six okay we'll do a little bit of the

297
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,600
background music but although

298
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,240
maybe okay we have eight anybody anybody

299
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,320
waiting on two more people want to be

300
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,760
loners go on their own okay now that's

301
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,240
good we're going to get

302
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:34,079
started oh we got winners okay

303
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,279
oh and okay great super um here we go so

304
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,720
about 20 or 30 seconds on each one

305
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:42,120
there's uh 11 questions I think 13

306
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,120
questions

307
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,560
maybe which of the following is a binary

308
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,560
music representation

309
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,639
so this is your time if you haven't done

310
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,920
this before lock in something no points

311
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,920
for

312
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,199
wrong three

313
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,199
two what do we have midi mid is the only

314
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,800
one that is typically represented in

315
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:25,480
binary code and not in

316
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,920
text okay okay I know you you would have

317
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,240
thought I would have made the answer

318
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,360
music XML to honor our guest but you

319
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,880
didn't you knew it wasn't music XML you

320
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,240
knew it wasn't music XML because you

321
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,959
studied that well enough good let's keep

322
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,880
going okay hey Nick the creative

323
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,959
nicknames are up top according to cook

324
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,759
what is ironic about the timing of the

325
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,759
rise and fall of comparative and

326
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,759
computational musicology

327
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,680
hey most we got it comparative

328
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,240
musicology which is kind of designed

329
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,600
well for computers declined at the time

330
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,839
computers came

331
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
up okay that's Nicholas Cook's

332
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,079
comparative and computational musicology

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,360
to review if that one wasn't obvious

334
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,600
we'll keep going okay we got much more

335
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,600
on the board

336
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:35,680
who was not a composer whose music was

337
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
discussed by cook who was not in

338
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,959
there this is a hard one this is about

339
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,959
as hard

340
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,880
as 3

341
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,040
seconds oh most people got it voger no

342
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,319
liity was the one with all the graphs

343
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,440
showing when things come in and out and

344
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:04,720
the hideen one heyen was used as the

345
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,800
example for um for the German

346
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,279
nationalist song he was the composer of

347
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,279
the music but not the

348
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,330
lyrics okay we got one

349
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,120
fire fu

350
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,880
[Music]

351
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,240
fu the music 21 iterator talking about

352
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,639
my own stuff that returns offsets from

353
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,639
the start of the part is

354
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,360
[Music]

355
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,720
you got one more

356
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,079
person two

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,839
seconds hey almost everybody got

358
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,399
flattened I know you know that we Cur

359
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
somebody was trying to trying to do the

360
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,600
the thought experiment that I like

361
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,919
recurse better I keep telling you use

362
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,039
recurse but in this case flatten is the

363
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,039
better

364
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,039
one

365
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,120
oops

366
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,480
okay who wrote about musical codes in

367
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,480
the introduction to Beyond MIDI

368
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,359

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,559
oh done

370
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,320
done M Michael good does have an article

371
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,120
in that book but no you don't know that

372
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,520
was the next virtual score what I wrote

373
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,520
before starting

374
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,160
okay getting

375
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,440
close Dimitri tasko criticized me for

376
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,600
all of these things about music 21

377
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,600
except what this is hard

378
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,930
[Music]

379
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,840
and oh no the one thing he didn't

380
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,960
criticize me for is the worst feature on

381
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,799
it it is really hard to install but

382
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,240
somehow he already got it installed so

383
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:45,960
he didn't care about

384
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,039
that okay so that was that was one that

385
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,799
shook shook things up the

386
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,559
Snowman here we go um we're half over

387
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,440
halfway there this is an extra credit

388
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,400
from an optional reading so don't worry

389
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,360
but take a guess on this one Donald bird

390
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,919
created his extremes of music notation

391
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,919
uh thing to show that notation

392
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,240
what yeah good good good okay we don't

393
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,080
need to discuss that even if you didn't

394
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,799
do the reading it's really cool article

395
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,559
if you haven't had a chance to flip

396
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,840
through it some weird things in there

397
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,360
Craig Sap's name good guy good guy

398
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,720
appeared in this class for his creation

399
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,720
of

400
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,440
[Music]

401
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,159
what okay what do we get yes the

402
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,880
illustration of the same passage of

403
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,760
Music in dozens of encodings also known

404
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,640
allowing you to translate from one

405
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:07,200
coding to another called the Rosetta

406
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:09,320
Stone yep um we got um he now runs the

407
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,919
hum drum thing but it was David here on

408
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:16,280
here um nobody did this one and uh yeah

409
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:21,480
I don't know the answer to the

410
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:24,760
red yellow exist um yes I believe so

411
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,799
somewhere I this is from the reading for

412
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,960
today so we'll see if we got today's

413
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,600
reading what do David Luen call his

414
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,600
unifying rule for species

415
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,720
Counterpoint okay a lot of people gold R

416
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,720
those who said Golden Rule by the way I

417
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,039
am going to misspeak and call it the

418
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,280
Golden Rule a lot because I do that but

419
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,240
um yep we'll talk about it a little bit

420
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,240
more the end of class

421
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:14,360
today common or conventional music

422
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,360
notation also CW MN consists of

423
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,840
what Seven Answers

424
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,240
[Music]

425
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,480
yeah it's I know all of the above is

426
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
almost always the right answer when you

427
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,600
take a guess but no in this case it was

428
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,039
just um things that traditional western

429
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,080
music notation in some way so that you

430
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,600
can write down non-western and you can

431
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,720
ENC as you all know you can encode many

432
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,559
things into the computer that are not

433
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,559
that so great we're doing we're doing

434
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,559
well

435
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,559
now okay three

436
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,559
more oh

437
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,559
wow nice we don't need to do that

438
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:25,200
[Music]

439
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:29,000
anymore Arden and hon showed how

440
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,120
European folk song varied across genre

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,120
times locations

442
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:44,000
[Music]

443
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,240
functions hey yep we almost always got

444
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
that this was the article that showed

445
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,520
the geographic information systems back

446
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,520
when that was very very hard to do we

447
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,640
should be able to do this more easily

448
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,440
with Google Maps and

449
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,200
things

450
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,080
okay before we do the last one uh before

451
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,360
we do the last one just to know the quiz

452
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,080
will not be a bunch of these little

453
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,360
factoid things that's just all I can

454
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,400
figure out to do on cahoot it will be

455
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,240
actually about conceptual issues and

456
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,000
ability to apply these ideas but um

457
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,760
let's finish this oh it's about uh

458
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,679
Sophia son and me showed connections

459
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,159
between music and emotion using what

460
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,159
types of musical scores

461
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,760
[Music]

462
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,520
answer oh no I know I do too many V

463
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:52,480
crows and I do medieval music but it was

464
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:54,919
lead sheets uh so yep oh yeah read great

465
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,360
so we have on the

466
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:58,960
podium third place nickname three

467
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:05,600
anybody want to claim their Podium

468
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,600
nicely done nickname too yep and

469
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,960
top I guess this shows that some people

470
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,760
spend their time not thinking of

471
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,840
creative names but just reading the

472
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,240
Articles congrats everybody so we've

473
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,000
been talking a lot about encodings and

474
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,000
what you'll be doing over the course of

475
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,720
the semester sometimes is working with

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,600
these strange encodings and maybe as

477
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,080
we're starting to get well let me say

478
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,000
you've had some problem sets where I've

479
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,600
given you questions and you've given

480
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,360
answers right and now you've given two

481
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,279
problem sets that encoding one and uh

482
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,320
this corpor one where you've been doing

483
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,159
the research to find interesting

484
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,679
problems but I haven't been asking you

485
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,679
to actually get an answer you didn't

486
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,640
need to make a corpus a par parser for

487
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,640
guitar um ultimate guitar in order to

488
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,679
answer any questions so we're getting to

489
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,600
the end of the semester we'll be

490
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,640
bringing those two things colliding

491
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,320
together and doing more um on how you

492
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,159
can come up with your own problems and

493
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,080
come up with your own Solutions Michael

494
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,679
would you like to come up and talk for

495
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,600
just a little bit I'd like to introduce

496
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:17,040
Michael good who's uh MIT grad and the

497
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,720
inventor of Music XML up here who's

498
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,200
[Applause]

499
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,399
Vis you all have seen an interview with

500
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Michael right so just wanted to to talk

501
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:28,840
the interview is a couple couple years

502
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:32,000
old now I think we did it during covid

503
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,320
um yeah so what's what's been up and

504
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,880
interesting in the world of anything

505
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,960
with computer music but especially you

506
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,720
know music the encoding anything that

507
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:44,840
you've been finding or oh that's I I

508
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:49,480
retired um in January so my mind has

509
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,039
sort of gone out of the music notation

510
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,120
area

511
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,960
CL I mean some of the things that were

512
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,080
in these projects were really cool the

513
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,960
uh the body percussion en coding stuff

514
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,399
and I was like oh pretty pretty great

515
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,880
yeah do you do you feel like like now

516
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:05,480
now you got to come out of retirement

517
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,080
and find a way to put all these things

518
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,200
into music XML not yet

519
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,000
okay so but in the future but what what

520
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,120
are some ways that somebody could get um

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520
you know a particular musical project if

522
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,760
they're interested in you know

523
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,799
non-western music or something else and

524
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,320
get get such a standard um sort of

525
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,760
musical encoding as as you've created

526
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,840
what what kind of advice would you give

527
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:34,120
for that well

528
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,039
you to develop a standard for a music

529
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,720
representation you need to have multiple

530
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,279
people who are using it right and you

531
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,399
need to have I think tools that that

532
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,360
support it so that becomes if it's non

533
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:48,159
standard that becomes more of a you know

534
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,120
less common repertoire that becomes more

535
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,320
of a chicken and an egg problem so look

536
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,760
for something that has at least two

537
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,600
applications that are doing that type of

538
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,200
music and see if you can do maybe there

539
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,159
one's an application you wrote and one's

540
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,480
an application somebody else wrote and

541
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,399
tried to put something in between I mean

542
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,080
when I was starting music XML a lot of

543
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,880
people had tried to do a standard common

544
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,880
western music notation format and I knew

545
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
that if it was if it didn't work with

546
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,840
either finale or cilus because those are

547
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,159
the two programs people cared about then

548
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,799
if it didn't work with at least one of

549
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,559
those two programs I was just going to

550
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,840
give up go home and find something else

551
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,720
to do because nobody would care about

552
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,000
music XML if it didn't work with one of

553
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,240
those programs nowaday be M score Oro or

554
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,960
things like

555
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,840
that so if you're trying to do a

556
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,200
standard music representation then you

557
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,519
need to have a community of people who

558
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,640
are using it and applications that use

559
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,159
it um maybe more interesting is just to

560
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,399
you know at this point is to come up

561
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,840
with cool things that could be

562
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:54,640
represented and and and do some analysis

563
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,159
there and and try to figure out ways

564
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,799
that these representations could be

565
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,279
useful for the musicians

566
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,960
uh who are doing these type of

567
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,600
repertoire great so Michael was um you

568
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,159
did music when you were at MIT oh yeah

569
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,360
what what kinds of things well I was a

570
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,360
trumpet player nowadays I sing my wife

571
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,919
my wife my wife and I met in the MIT

572
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,279
concert band she's an electrical

573
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,600
engineer right she's she's uh the one of

574
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,080
the 40 top engineers at Analog Devices

575
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,279
so she just was talking with race dat at

576
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,279
her company

577
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,240
conference a couple days ago so she's 61

578
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:29,559
I'm 63 uh I'm class of 79 she's class of

579
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,640
82 and she played Piccolo I played

580
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:34,600
trumpet and I played trumpet in the band

581
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,799
The Orchestra Festival Jazz Ensemble

582
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,760
chamber music Society musical you know

583
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,600
anything that needed a trumpet laptop

584
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,519
Ensemble played it there was no there

585
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,159
was no laptop laptops were not

586
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,559
invented I was I ter the the coolest

587
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,440
thing I did my my thesis in the

588
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:53,240
experimental music studio with Professor

589
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Barry burko which is now the media lab

590
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,159
one of the groups that became part of

591
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,480
the media lab and the coolest thing was

592
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:03,600
we got to use t52 terminals instead you

593
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,159
know video terminals instead of the you

594
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,679
know paper terminals that I was using

595
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,080
for all my other classes so I got to use

596
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,240
the coolest computer technology that I

597
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,000
had seen at that point in my computer

598
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,000
music class so that was awesome so

599
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,799
Michael here's a a question I haven't I

600
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,440
I don't think I've ever asked you so so

601
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,120
you did music while you were at MIT and

602
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,200
you did other things and then um but

603
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,159
music wasn't your primary um sort of you

604
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
know putting money in you're in a bank

605
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:33,159
for a bit um you could ask a little bit

606
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,120
about what that was but what made you

607
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,000
want to come back and do it and is there

608
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,519
anything for anybody who's not thinking

609
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,120
of graduating this year next year

610
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,720
whatever and doing music but might

611
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,039
follow a career like years well yeah

612
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,440
following a career like line is kind of

613
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,039
I mean it's a whole different time now

614
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,080
when I I was doing my bachelor's thesis

615
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,240
at the experimental music studio was on

616
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,799
one of these alpha alpha numeric

617
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,679
encodings um which is now called Scott

618
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:59,880
it's actually still still shipped I

619
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,039
think as part of sees sound and I was

620
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,039
rewriting it from an earlier version

621
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,640
called Soo but this was in 1979 so there

622
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,519
was no midi right there was no computer

623
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,080
music technology industry okay New

624
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,519
England digital was doing some clavet

625
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,679
but you know that was know one tiny

626
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,039
company so there wasn't any industry to

627
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,919
go to for a job so I started to do

628
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:25,399
usability work as for my grad school I I

629
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:29,760
got my masters here too and I did

630
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:31,440
usability work until 2000 when it you

631
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,519
could see that everything was going to

632
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,799
this is when the web was coming up and

633
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,320
you know everything was going to be

634
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,480
moved this app over to the web from from

635
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,640
from Au GOI and the first time I did

636
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,120
that it was a lot of fun and but doing

637
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,840
it a thousand times was going to be

638
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,440
really boring so I looked at you know

639
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,720
there was an opportunity to do a

640
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,559
standard music notation format there was

641
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,279
downloadable sheet music starting to

642
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,559
happen it was IND decent uh thing so

643
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,399
there was obviously a demand for uh a

644
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,039
standard computer music because it was

645
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,399
silly you could download the music and

646
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,880
all you could do was use it in the

647
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,159
player or print it out and it's was like

648
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,399
you should be able to share it back and

649
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,600
forth between programs like HTML and

650
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,519
midi you know if you don't have a

651
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,080
standard it's it's nothing for for that

652
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,720
type of common things

653
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,679
so that was the motivation to do it you

654
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,279
know that I I wanted to use downloadable

655
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,600
music in any

656
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,960
application and I but I had the

657
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,559
financial uh ability to do that because

658
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,519
my wife worked for Analog Devices and

659
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,799
elect engineer and their company did

660
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,399
really well and so if I totally failed

661
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,519
it didn't matter financially so I mean I

662
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:41,000
was in extremely lucky position there I

663
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,919
me nowadays though you can you know you

664
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,399
got each other all interested in music

665
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,880
technology and there's all sort I

666
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,200
mean to go through I mean if IID had a

667
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,279
class like this I wouldn't have had a

668
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,760
class like this because you didn't I had

669
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,960
to spend all my time like building

670
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,320
infrastructure now you can do the cool

671
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,080
things on top of you know the cool

672
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,080
problems on top of it so find find cool

673
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,200
problems that people are interested in

674
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,880
uh I mean if you want to make a career

675
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,960
if you if you're just studying you know

676
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,440
find a cool problem that you're

677
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,880
interested in well that's I guess the

678
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,080
starting point anyway find a cool

679
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,399
problem that you're interested in

680
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,720
because if you're not interested in it

681
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,600
you won't be able to make a living at it

682
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,799
you'll just be terribly bored and then

683
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,399
find if somebody else is interested in

684
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,519
that or something

685
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,120
adjacent one last question before I let

686
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,360
you go if that's if that's okay um you

687
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,279
know it's hard for us to think of you

688
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,919
know that that you went from the

689
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,399
essentially teletype era things you

690
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,880
don't see things on screen you have to

691
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:42,279
type it onto and then it all comes out

692
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,919
on paper and stuff in of what 30 uh

693
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,519
bytes per second uh modems and and and

694
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,279
things like that to I mean until two

695
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,440
months ago when you retired you were

696
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:55,480
still totally on top of of like 99% as

697
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,120
many percent of the new technologies as

698
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,240
anybody can do and things and someday

699
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,960
it's hard for us to think but these will

700
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,480
seem as outrageous as a teletype or a

701
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,159
horse and buggy and stuff what not just

702
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,080
for music people but how do we keep up

703
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,200
how do we keep up like you with all the

704
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,720
changing

705
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,880
technology if you're a tech person like

706
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,559
I think you you kind of do

707
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,279
that live in Silicon Valley you gota but

708
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,039
stay with you know what's going I mean I

709
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,639
have this usability background so I was

710
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,600
always interested in user interface

711
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,320
Technologies but I mean I don't know

712
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,919
anything about machine learning

713
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,120
outside of applications for it I mean in

714
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:35,120
the music space I'm excited to see what

715
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,559
sound slice is doing for using machine

716
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,039
learning for optical music recognition

717
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,960
What audio Shake is doing for Source

718
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:45,480
separation of of audio which everybody

719
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,039
tried to do and nobody would they're the

720
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,360
first ones who are able to do it and

721
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,240
they're very clear about which problems

722
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,000
they can handle and which problems they

723
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,519
can't and why it's a good market and why

724
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,039
it's supporting musicians so we were

725
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,000
talking a little earlier about with

726
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,720
generative music things sort of to sum

727
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,880
up what you're saying is make make sure

728
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,039
that there's a problem that you're

729
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,040
trying to solve yeah a problem that

730
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,520
you're trying to solve that isn't

731
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,520
putting musicians out of work would

732
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,200
be well thanks Michael for I wish we

733
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,040
could have had you earlier when we were

734
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,119
specifically talking music XML but we

735
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,960
can't go you can't go six weeks into the

736
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,079
semester without knowing music XML so

737
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,720
even knowing you're coming now uh it's

738
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,720
still it's so great so thanks and

739
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,119
and feel free to stay feel free to move

740
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,119
on we're going to uh unlock intervals

741
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,000
we're going to be moving on to the

742
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,839
shortest topic of the semester and that

743
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,839
is a voice leading you're going to get

744
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:47,359
just a little bit for me today you're

745
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,879
going to have the world's shortest um

746
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,399
not the world's shortest but a pretty

747
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,200
short problem set and then we'll do talk

748
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,720
about it a little bit after um after the

749
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,280
midterm on Wednesday and that will be it

750
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,760
uh it's very important topic we're going

751
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,680
to keep working on it it's why it

752
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,680
deserves to have its own number um but

753
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,839
uh what um when we're talking about

754
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,320
voice leading we're generally talking

755
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,720
about how yeah we just need one staff

756
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,040
for

757
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:18,280
this how

758
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,920
multiple parts are moving at the same

759
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,400
time

760
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,960
so this would be pretty bad voice

761
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,280
leaning maybe very dissonant but

762
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:33,280
something we're talking about not what's

763
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,280
happening

764
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,400
here and not what's happening that one's

765
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,400
hard to do

766
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,880
here but the combination of the two and

767
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:50,720
why voice leading becomes a particularly

768
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,760
interesting problem for computers is

769
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,200
there's two general ways of inter of

770
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,240
iterating um both and both um

771
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,520
both flatten and recurse are in some

772
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,760
ways well no sorry uh recurse is sort of

773
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,200
the you go through one part or one voice

774
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,520
and you go through everything and you go

775
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,480
through the other part and the other

776
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,040
voice and you go through everything and

777
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,200
then you have something like flatten

778
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,359
which in the

779
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,839
end especially if everything is just

780
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,800
quarter notes you're going through one

781
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,760
slice going to the next and going to the

782
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,920
next

783
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,599
slice so voice leading is a particular

784
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,440
problem requires you to be constantly

785
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,200
moving back and forth between I'm moving

786
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,079
according to Voice or according to part

787
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,440
and I'm looking at what's happening at

788
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,280
one time or

789
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,680
another um one of the classic

790
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,800
applications for uh sort of starting off

791
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,760
computational voice leading is to work

792
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,119
on a topic called species Counterpoint

793
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,240
has anybody who has done species

794
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,119
CounterPoint in one of their classes

795
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,520
some instructors do it some don't not

796
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:04,920
everybody has so there's it's a um I

797
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,520
think it's invented it's an 18th century

798
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,599
way of learning to write music like they

799
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:15,520
wrote it in the 16th century so not 100%

800
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,960
relevant to um to music composition

801
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,119
today but still sort of a fundamental

802
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,800
skill like um you practicing your scales

803
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,480
or something Mozart and Brahms uh

804
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,119
practiced species Counterpoint uh every

805
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,880
day sort of keep up their chops um the

806
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,960
earliest the first species that we tend

807
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,240
to call it is something is all in whole

808
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,480
notes let me see if I can compose one um

809
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,040
while

810
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,319
we're

811
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,960
um how many notes I write 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

812
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:52,079
8 nine good classic ones tend to be

813
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,400
around nine notes long and then against

814
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,599
this in first species you're going to

815
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:02,119
write one whole note for every

816
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:06,800
note with particular conditions and some

817
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:10,319
of these conditions will be horizontally

818
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,319
constraining like for

819
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,839
instance uh yeah now this that

820
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,839
particular one

821
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:24,520
don't do that why

822
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,520
not trone Yep this case augmented fourth

823
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,440
um or diminished fifth usually not

824
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,079
allowed also especially in this context

825
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,119
good so some of these things are going

826
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,480
to be based on that and on on one case

827
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,119
and some of them are going to be based

828
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,160
on vertical things this would not be

829
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,160
allowed why

830
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:48,960
not sorry I need to two

831
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,880
colors what's what somebody said it I

832
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,119
just didn't

833
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,960
hear no no I think I think I heard it

834
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,920
properly seventh yeah so um in first

835
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,400
species the rule is all horizontal

836
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,760
vertical intervals must be consonant and

837
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:10,839
all vertical intervals must be

838
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,560
consonant but then there are other

839
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,560
strange little

840
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,560
rules

841
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,200
like this is a consonant

842
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,599
interval this is a consonant interval

843
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,079
this is a con I I was going to do red

844
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,359
this is a constant interval all these

845
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,359
intervals are consonant what's the

846
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:35,760
problem here with these

847
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:37,480
two for anybody who's done this yeah so

848
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,599
parallel fifth so what's the interval G

849
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:46,720
to D perfect fifth e to B perfect fifth

850
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,119
so two perfect fifths in a row um so I

851
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,960
just want to give uh there for anybody

852
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,720
who wants to um I don't have a

853
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,400
formalized extra credit for this but um

854
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,240
if you can writing

855
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,119
software that can solve any given what

856
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,240
we call the this is the part that's

857
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,040
given to you there's always one part

858
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,400
that's given to you it's called the Kus

859
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,760
fmis or the fixed song in Latin and so

860
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,760
you fixed you can't change it and one of

861
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,359
the classic things is to write um

862
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
nowadays in computers is to write

863
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,880
software that can solve the other part

864
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,400
that can give you the other part there

865
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,280
and that's one of the ones if you're

866
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,599
interested in in optimization and

867
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,000
algorithmic things that this is one of

868
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,359
the cases the first cases in this class

869
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,119
where it is easy to write something that

870
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,680
will do it properly but for a 20 note or

871
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,960
40 Note One won't be able to generate it

872
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,839
in the time that the Universe um before

873
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,640
the heat death of the universe so it's

874
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,960
something where uh algorithmic

875
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,960
complexity comes in you are not going to

876
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,680
be given that assignment this year um

877
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,040
you all have worked pretty hard right

878
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,960
this this class is yeah okay so not

879
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,760
doing that seems like a good thing but

880
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,720
instead we're going to be

881
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:05,160
what you're going to be asked to do uh

882
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:09,240
over between now and next Friday is to

883
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:12,640
um come up and encode some of the basic

884
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,640
features underlying how you might solve

885
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,839
a problem like this and specifically how

886
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,359
you might avoid things like this uh

887
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,200
there's one or two uh things on this the

888
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,920
this is not get an everything correct

889
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,000
problem set but um looking quite down

890
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,640
the road to the second probably the

891
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,119
second to last problem set in this class

892
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,079
problem set nine will this will be

893
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,839
foundational knowledge on it and that

894
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,480
one problem set nine you're going to be

895
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,480
given a piece and you're going to be

896
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,800
asked to remove all the passing tones

897
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,640
and all the ornaments and leave it just

898
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,839
with the block chords and so being able

899
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,119
to identify voice leading moments is

900
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,359
pretty

901
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:55,319
important okay so let's unlock intervals

902
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,720
you've been working a lot on them

903
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:01,880
so unlocking

904
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,560
interval let's go ahead and from music

905
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,839
21 import uh Corpus which we'll use just

906
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:14,480
at the very end if we have time note

907
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:19,240
pitch and the brand new interval

908
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,240
module is that big enough bigger

909
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,480
better okay um we'll start with the wor

910
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,599
worst variable name ever I equals the

911
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,720
interval module so it's

912
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:38,280
lowercase and the

913
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:40,400
interval class in there P5 let's start

914
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,960
with a perfect fifth these are all

915
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,680
things that you've been

916
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,760
doing within the interval module by the

917
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,920
way there are interval classes called

918
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,640
chromatic interval diatonic interval

919
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,280
generic interval all these things but

920
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,200
the interval class will let you do

921
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,599
basically almost anything in there great

922
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,680
so now you've created a P5 interval you

923
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,880
can get its name which is very unhelpful

924
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,559
it just tells you what you just put in

925
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,440
but you can get its nice name uh with a

926
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,520
capital N in the

927
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,920
middle perfect fifth um so it's just a

928
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,359
little bit more helpful Let's uh keep

929
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,400
going we can get its directed nice name

930
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,880
so this is Allin snake case or camel

931
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,440
case whatever you want to call it

932
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,160
directed nice with a capital N name with

933
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,920
a capital m and

934
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,520
get us sending perfect fifth so there's

935
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,359
sometimes we care about what direction

936
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,079
the interval is and sometimes we don't

937
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,680
uh in Melodies we care or don't

938
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,079
care take a guess when you're talking

939
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,400
about Melodies do we care which

940
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,760
direction the interval

941
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,480
is yes when we're talking about the

942
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,160
notes of a chord do we care no not

943
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,079
usually right because we're just talking

944
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,079
about uh what things are great so if we

945
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:59,040
want to create um a descending interval

946
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,040
we can create interval.

947
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,040
interval

948
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,839
P5 and get its directed nice name you

949
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,720
don't have to type all things I'll put

950
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,079
this up later if you're not a fast

951
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,800
typist but you can do that um also

952
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,720
because I can never remember which one

953
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,240
we prefer uh you can do negative P5

954
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,640
because I I don't know which one of

955
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,119
those is actually

956
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,400
better okay so that the most basic way

957
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:35,839
of doing things um

958
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:38,720
let's try to get the intervals um from

959
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:44,280
pitches first off so let's create two

960
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:48,119
pitches we'll create um pitch. Pitch

961
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:52,280
B3 P2 pitch.

962
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:54,480
pitch C5 so not little hard but not too

963
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,119
hard and you don't need to type the

964
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,480
question marks we're going to get the

965
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:00,200
interval interval.

966
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,319
interval

967
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:07,160
interval between P1 and P2 so you can

968
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,440
instead of putting in a string you can

969
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,359
give it two pitches or something and I'm

970
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,640
going to name this variable after what

971
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:19,480
the name should be the interval between

972
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,119
B3 and C5 what should I call that

973
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,880
somebody who hasn't already gotten ahead

974
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,400
in the computer what is that interv

975
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,000
always try to do things in your head the

976
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:34,040
first time

977
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,960
nth minor 9th so I'll do lowercase m n u

978
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,119
I do like naming things according to

979
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,359
their interval or according to what

980
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,640
they're representing it does hit my anal

981
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:46,920
retentive uh like must be everything

982
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,599
must be in order streak that when we do

983
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,640
have something that should be a major

984
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:52,760
third it's capital M but then I go

985
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,920
Capital should only be used for classes

986
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,760
and you know um but SI we have to do

987
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,359
that okay so we have do we get

988
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,640
yep minor ninth how many semitones in a

989
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,640
minor

990
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:11,520
ninth uh 13 13 13 so dot semitones will

991
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:15,400
give you the number of semmit tones in

992
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:19,839
an interval which is often quite helpful

993
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:23,319
um obviously m9n name will give

994
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:28,720
youname will give you M9 but M9 dos

995
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:28,720
simple name also in C snake case

996
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,800
so when you're dealing with compound

997
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,079
intervals there is something called

998
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:40,240
Simple name that would be very helpful

999
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:44,240
for working through things

1000
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,839
um there's um now there's there's some

1001
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,559
some slight difference let's um let's

1002
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,559
come up with another interval this one

1003
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,880
I'll call

1004
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,800
p8 and I'll just show so you can do some

1005
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,480
of these things here we can also create

1006
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,200
an interval from notes not just from

1007
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,960
pitches uh that's probably a mistake in

1008
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,280
my taxonomy morony whatever it is but um

1009
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,880
it's been there for a while so p8 should

1010
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:12,720
be C4 to C five good the only difference

1011
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:16,440
why I'm creating a octave I should have

1012
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,000
just call it octave right um is that

1013
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,119
sometimes that the octave simple name is

1014
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,839
perfect Unis P1 right but um sometimes

1015
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,359
we care about the difference between

1016
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:30,440
octaves and Unison in a way that we

1017
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:34,400
don't care about uh seconds and nins so

1018
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:36,760
there is something called p8 dosi Simple

1019
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,040
name I wish I had spent some more time

1020
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,720
coming up with it which basically is

1021
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,200
exactly the same as a simple name except

1022
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,680
that things that are multiples of

1023
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,160
octaves get squished down to an octave

1024
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,760
so a double octave also becomes an

1025
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:57,119
octave in the semi-simple name whereas

1026
00:47:51,760 --> 00:48:00,760
the 9th's semisimple name is my minor

1027
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,960
second I think there's also things see

1028
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,760
if I still have all these in here semi

1029
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:11,000
simple nice name yeah okay so there's

1030
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,200
there are all of these things in there

1031
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,960
great um

1032
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:19,400
let's let's stop typing so much and

1033
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:22,319
let's create some aliases Alias um we's

1034
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,839
just capital I is the interval. interval

1035
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:29,319
class so now we can call I and get new

1036
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:33,119
interval and P the pitch. pitch class

1037
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:36,800
not a pitch class the class pitch inside

1038
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,880
the module pitch right is that able to

1039
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,960
be

1040
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,079
seen great so now we can create like

1041
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,680
minor

1042
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:51,200
third just like that just a capital I

1043
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:54,119
parentheses and slow down okay slow down

1044
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,440
slow down yes a little bit okay good

1045
00:48:54,119 --> 00:49:00,520
great pause for a second on this

1046
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,520
so far so far this is great uh except

1047
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,319
for being able to get the interval from

1048
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,079
two pitches which will probably be very

1049
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,160
helpful for you uh there's not too much

1050
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,799
you can do once you have an interval

1051
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:16,079
object so let's start creating some

1052
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:17,520
things that um might like so don't have

1053
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,319
to type all these things but this is

1054
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,240
probably a nice one to do the interval

1055
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:25,520
of a minor third is consonant now this

1056
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,520
is probably a mistaken term before I hit

1057
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,720
enter Because all of these things are

1058
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,520
consonant in some of the world's

1059
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,599
traditions and some not in some of the

1060
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,920
other world's traditions in fact um some

1061
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,680
of the early proposals of Music 21 said

1062
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,440
oh and then you'll be able to have a

1063
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,440
context objects which will be able to

1064
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,400
affect how these things are so if you're

1065
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,280
in 14th century Europe This will be

1066
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,359
false and if you're in some part if

1067
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,760
you're giving it a southern uh Southern

1068
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:57,040
Indian context it might be fals or you

1069
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,440
depending on what the time is and I've

1070
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,319
never actually fully implemented that so

1071
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,280
right now unfortunately this privileges

1072
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,400
the Western um sort of classical music

1073
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,960
context what should this be if it's in a

1074
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,640
western classical music context minor

1075
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:16,000
thirds are constant or dissonant con

1076
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:19,880
Conant good I programmed something right

1077
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,599
um now let's try something else a major

1078
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,559
sixth consonant or dissonant consonant

1079
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:27,400
consonant

1080
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,400
good and um

1081
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,839
sorry I'm just going to I'm typing a lot

1082
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,240
here you can probably assign things

1083
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,640
variables uh the number of semitones in

1084
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,920
a major

1085
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,920
6

1086
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:44,160
nine nine good now I'm going to create a

1087
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:47,559
diminish sth I lowercase

1088
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,760
D7 and number of semmit tones in a

1089
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:50,760
diminished

1090
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:54,599
7th

1091
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:59,000
11 one guess another guess n

1092
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,000
nine so diminish seventh is

1093
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:06,960
consonant false so one of the things

1094
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:10,040
built into the music 21 ontology that's

1095
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,760
different from um so Dimitri Chacho's

1096
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:16,680
optic default ontology is that spelling

1097
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:20,640
matters this case so diminish 7th sounds

1098
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,280
the same as a major sixth in isolation

1099
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,760
but it's not considered

1100
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:30,200
consonant that's important to know and

1101
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,000
uh I think uh I think last year there

1102
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,480
was a month that went by without

1103
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,680
somebody reporting this as a bug to the

1104
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,799
music 21 list but most most months one

1105
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,160
to two people um put that in not see

1106
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:47,680
that so it definitely means that you

1107
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:50,240
know um you uh I don't know an augmented

1108
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,280
sth is not consonant either even though

1109
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,640
an augmented second seventh is another

1110
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,640
way of

1111
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:01,119
saying octave perfect octave great super

1112
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,240
um basically anything in traditional

1113
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,599
theory in traditional tonal Theory

1114
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,400
anything that is marked as diminished or

1115
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,520
augmented or doubly diminished or doubly

1116
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,920
augmented or whatever is considered

1117
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:18,200
dissonant now the weird

1118
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,480
one um that we can always debate is the

1119
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,799
perfect forth who thinks it's

1120
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,839
consonants who thinks it's a

1121
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:28,319
dissonance a lot of people not voting

1122
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:30,839
I'm glad for either way people voted um

1123
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,839
in this case music 21 regards it as not

1124
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:35,240
a consonants perfect forths are

1125
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:37,480
generally they're the one weird interval

1126
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:41,119
they're generally considered consonant

1127
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:44,400
when they are melodic but dissonant when

1128
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:48,119
they're harmonic and above the

1129
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,720
base so it's take take Medieval music

1130
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,880
with me or speo um you can figure out

1131
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,400
the whole history of how this happened

1132
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,960
and why it's in the one weird double

1133
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,559
position but it's the only perfect thing

1134
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:03,319
that is not um consonant in some

1135
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:06,079
circumstances

1136
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:08,520
okay um what are some of the things you

1137
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,440
might do with interval uh class well

1138
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,440
let's start with let's create the

1139
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:17,200
perfect fifth one

1140
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:20,240
P5 hopefully I've created that good um

1141
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:25,000
and what we can do is let's say uh C4

1142
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:28,000
we'll just C this equals P

1143
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,240
C4 and now P5 can

1144
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,240
transpose pitch

1145
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,640
C4 so you have a perfect fifth creating

1146
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:44,640
that as an interval object storing as P5

1147
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,760
we can create a pitch object these just

1148
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:52,599
because of my aliases C4 start C4 then

1149
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:55,640
P5 can transpose the C4 transpose pitch

1150
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:58,200
on C4 and gets an a pitch object that's

1151
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:02,720
G4

1152
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:06,440
now once you've done that if we look at

1153
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:09,200
C4 that object is

1154
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:13,680
unchanged so transpose pitch creates a

1155
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,119
new pitch that is not uh that is not the

1156
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,680
same pitch so if you wanted to do

1157
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:23,440
something useful with this you would

1158
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:26,839
probably store it as G4 equals this and

1159
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,960
then you can do something with

1160
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:30,480
with your new pitch obviously if you

1161
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,599
knew what the pitch was going to be

1162
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,160
coming in and what the pitch was going

1163
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,559
to be coming out you wouldn't need to do

1164
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,599
this right you can just create your own

1165
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:42,160
damn G4 but um but this would work sort

1166
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:46,200
of in general if you do want to

1167
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,920
transpose in place um and I don't think

1168
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,480
we've seen this in music 21 but you're

1169
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,440
going to start seeing it all over the

1170
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,400
place there is a keyword only argument

1171
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,760
that means you must type this as a

1172
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,040
keyword in place equals so C4 will now

1173
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,040
be transposed

1174
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,040
and nothing will be returned we run it

1175
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,559
but now

1176
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,880
c4 is a really terribly named variable

1177
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:15,359
right C4 is now a

1178
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,640
G4 um if you're ever doing a demo you

1179
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,799
all remember when we took two notes we

1180
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,400
inserted two notes or we removed them

1181
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:24,160
from the stream and then everything was

1182
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,839
screwed up uh so I always I'm going to

1183
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,880
remember learned from that experience

1184
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:32,119
and make C4 uh equals C4 right

1185
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,319
again but sometimes we want to just have

1186
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:36,960
a generic P equals um here this time

1187
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:39,119
I'll write it out so that we can copy

1188
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,599
and paste this pitch. pitch

1189
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:45,640
C4 and uh we still have P5 let's just do

1190
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,480
this for I in range 13 we don't actually

1191
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,400
need I you can some people like to have

1192
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,559
underscore as a dummy variable but we're

1193
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,760
just going to for 13 times let's take

1194
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:56,359
the pitch and

1195
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:03,280
then uh we can no since we just done it

1196
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:03,280
P5 transpose pitch p in place equals

1197
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:19,680
true so we create a

1198
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:22,359
C4 13 times we're going to go through

1199
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,880
and um transpose

1200
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:28,240
it so what is p

1201
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,280
now C

1202
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,960
B

1203
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,960
10 is that what it

1204
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:45,119
is oops not c um what do you call it

1205
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,960
P F double sharp 11 because if you

1206
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,400
notice we were Printing and then

1207
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,720
transposing was my little uh little

1208
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,640
trick thing just to just to make sure

1209
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,640
that we're all following things yeah so

1210
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,200
by the way this is one of the weird

1211
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:04,200
reasons why um why I wanted you to work

1212
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,640
early on with weird octave numbers like

1213
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:11,079
10 and 11 and -2 and things like that

1214
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,039
because quite often it is simpler to do

1215
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:14,599
an operation like this like let's all go

1216
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:16,480
around the circle of fifths and then

1217
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,880
we'll just print the step of it and not

1218
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,079
care about the octave number and then we

1219
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,400
in the end we can bring it back down a

1220
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,640
bunch of octaves later but sometimes

1221
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,520
you're going to end up in there and

1222
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,400
sometimes you're going to end up in in

1223
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,400
double sharp territory triple sharp

1224
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,079
territory before then transposing down

1225
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,359
back the other way or doing some other

1226
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:41,720
path so some so almost never is

1227
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:44,039
um is you know F quadruple sharp 22

1228
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,960
going to be a useful thing to think

1229
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,119
about musically but sometimes it's a

1230
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,079
useful point in the mid in the midpoint

1231
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,440
of your work and by the way that's how

1232
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,799
imaginary numbers came out first that

1233
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,280
they were first used to solve I believe

1234
00:57:55,799 --> 00:58:01,240
Quint equations in a way that U made it

1235
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,359
very easy even though they were NE in

1236
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,720
the intermediate stages even though they

1237
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:10,440
were never the answer at the end um so

1238
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:14,319
think of quadruple Sharps and octave 22s

1239
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:17,880
and stuff as like that okay

1240
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:23,799
um so a couple couple things is C4 still

1241
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:26,440
C4 yep good um you can also

1242
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:28,280
transpose uh do the opposite way way and

1243
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,400
this is a this is a real something that

1244
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,119
python allows that other languages I

1245
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,640
haven't been able to do it in so instead

1246
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,640
of taking the interval and saying tr.

1247
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,920
transpose pitch and the pitch you can

1248
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,720
take the pitch and say transpose that by

1249
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,520
the interval and that's sometimes pretty

1250
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:48,720
helpful so music 21 object. transpose by

1251
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:52,760
an interval class and um if you don't

1252
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:56,200
care about efficiency you can always um

1253
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,799
put in um just a string and it will

1254
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:02,039
create a interval for you and so

1255
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:05,880
transposing up an augmented 223rd gets

1256
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:11,160
you g Shar 35 is that right doesn't

1257
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:13,319
matter okay um by the way um okay uh

1258
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,079
looking at the time one or two last

1259
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:19,440
things uh if you ever

1260
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,079
want something when you um when you're

1261
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,839
working with the this is the interval

1262
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,720
object again perfect fifth there are

1263
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:28,880
things like specifier in here and you'll

1264
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:33,799
be able to um do a you know how to do

1265
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:37,440
dur on a um uh what do you call it on a

1266
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:40,119
object to see everything um that's in it

1267
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,000
but these are probably the most useful

1268
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:45,160
things you'll see so how many scents how

1269
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,319
many hundredths of a semitone is it and

1270
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,280
yes you can do microtonal intervals if

1271
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:51,280
you care about such things uh what's the

1272
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,480
chromatic interval what's the complement

1273
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,640
if you have a major sixth the complement

1274
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,200
is

1275
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,559
a remember it's minor thir it's the

1276
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,160
thing that fills out the octave dionic

1277
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:04,039
is it a skip is it a step can we reverse

1278
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,240
the interval all these things so you'll

1279
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:10,520
find some of these things in here um but

1280
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,760
the last thing I'm want to do is to

1281
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:16,280
think about uh this spelling non-s

1282
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:20,359
spelling thing so implicit dionic we'll

1283
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:22,760
say um let's create the interval of four

1284
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:25,280
semitones so all I car is that it's an

1285
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,480
interval of four semit tones and here's

1286
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,280
where um what do we call it polyvalent

1287
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,480
um polygamus whatever whatever we call

1288
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:37,319
the interval it will take um I that was

1289
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:39,000
a joke um it will take an integer

1290
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:42,920
instead of a string so we can say the

1291
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,240
int four and if I just look at this I4

1292
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:49,520
right now it looks like hey it's just a

1293
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,240
cheap way of saying major third but it's

1294
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:55,480
actually a little bit different from

1295
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:57,200
that so if I take the pitch C double

1296
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:01,640
flat

1297
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:05,119
um so pitch C flat

1298
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:09,680
4 and i' say I4

1299
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:11,559
transpose that pitch so take cou flat 4

1300
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,079
and take it up a major third I don't

1301
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:14,880
care about the accidental but what's the

1302
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:17,200
F what's the step have to be if you're

1303
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,720
going up a third from C

1304
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:25,119
something e e so it should be uh what is

1305
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,119
that e double flat 4

1306
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:31,520
and instead you get a D4 so there's

1307
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,880
something where if you initiate an

1308
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:37,119
interval just by saying the number of

1309
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:41,000
semones you're telling that interval

1310
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,680
that the dionic interval the minor major

1311
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,520
uh the major third is implicit that is

1312
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,880
to say um when you want to know if it's

1313
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:53,079
a major third yeah it'll be a major

1314
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:56,000
third but I4 will say no feel free to

1315
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:59,839
change this to anything that is for sem

1316
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,160
tones up that is logical um and easy to

1317
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:05,920
use so that's something that people will

1318
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,240
um see in there whereas if we take the

1319
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,720
perfect fifth and see which we created

1320
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,880
it with the P5 thing and see if it's an

1321
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,760
implicit

1322
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:18,000
dionic false perfect fifth will always

1323
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,880
take the one that we created with the

1324
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,359
string P5 will always make sure that

1325
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,599
something is a P5 uh I'm looking at the

1326
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,520
time so I won't demonstrate last thing

1327
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,200
which is music 21 still has a

1328
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,720
restriction that it won't go above

1329
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,400
quadruple sharps or quadruple Flats so

1330
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:38,440
at that point even the dionic one will

1331
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,599
say uh forget what I said let's make it

1332
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:45,240
work and round

1333
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:47,119
things uh great I'm um that's that's all

1334
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,319
the time that I have if you transpose a

1335
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,920
whole score uh you'll see that the key

1336
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:53,039
signature is transpose with you which

1337
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,440
can be kind of helpful and I'll I'll

1338
01:02:53,039 --> 01:03:00,119
post my um I'll post my what do you call

1339
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:05,119
it uh the the thing where where I have

1340
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:05,119
that demo to the class right
