[Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,439
the fourth session is to talk about you

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,920
in a facilitative leader role do you

4
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:24,720
imagine yourself stepping into a leader

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,039
role in a public sector do you think you

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,119
need to develop additional skills or

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,800
capabilities before you would do that

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,399
that do you know for sure you will never

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,120
do that I want the discussion to be

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:43,879
about each person imagining themselves

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,399
yes or no maybe but only if in a

12
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,399
leadership role in the public Arena

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,920
in the negotiation field we often teach

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:32,680
about the need to be able to

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,520
self-regulate between empathy and

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,520
assertiveness we make that distinction

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,960
and we make that

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,960
connection because in most negotiations

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,560
we think it's important to hear what the

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,280
other side's concerns and interests are

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,640
so that you can find a way of responding

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,680
to them in exchange for reciprocity but

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:01,079
if you can't listened can't hear can't

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,600
empathize with their con concerns it's

25
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,880
unlikely you'll suggest something that

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,879
meets their interests meets their needs

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,680
and yours we tend to think of empathy as

28
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:18,599
something we pour out with people we

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,080
care about but in this leadership SL

30
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:26,120
Neti SL consensus building

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,360
context we argue that you need to be

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,800
able to up the empathy quotient

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,560
in order to be able to create enough of

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,840
a relationship with the others to hear

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,440
their

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,159
concerns so that you can construct some

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,879
proposal that's good for them and great

38
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:53,159
for you and if you can't listen and

39
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,920
present yourself in an empathetic way

40
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,360
you're not likely to find out from them

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,760
what's really on their mind and what

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,480
their most important concerns are so

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,519
there's a constant need to adjust in the

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,920
context of the kinds of hypotheticals

45
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,440
we've been talking

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,040
about how much empathy you're exhibiting

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,799
how much empathy you're trying to Jin up

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm not talking about play acting I'm

49
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,920
talking about serious effort to

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,000
empathize with the concerns of the other

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,799
they'll know if it's not serious and if

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,519
it's not serious it won't have the

53
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,400
effect you need it to have so how can

54
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,000
you you gin up a empathy for someone you

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,760
disagree with you don't like who you

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,239
think is evil who stands for bad things

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,280
but I'm saying you have got to find out

58
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,840
what's important to them and you've got

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,560
to get them to trust you enough to tell

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,879
you what's important to them so that you

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,640
can

62
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,760
construct

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,680
proposals for the other which could be a

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,799
group and not just a person and be

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,519
assertive about that at the same time in

66
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,040
the same setting in the same

67
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,400
interactions in which you have also been

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,840
empathetic there's a tension between

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,280
them but both need to be present there's

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,000
a really important distinction between

71
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,000
facilitation and mediation I did not

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,400
call this mediating leadership I call

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,240
this facilitating leadership that's

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,120
because facilitate ation means something

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:40,440
different from mediation you can't

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,280
mediate unless you can claim and perform

77
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,759
in a neutral way the definition of

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,880
mediation is neutral nonpartisan now no

79
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,720
human really is neutral ever but in this

80
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,479
professional role of

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,039
mediation you have to be accepted as

82
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,199
nonpartisan by the parties so the

83
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,400
measure of your neutrality is their

84
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,080
perception of you and their willingness

85
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,960
to accept the fact you are not there to

86
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,520
advance one side or the other side or

87
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,120
your own interests because if someone

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,919
thinks I've done something that's

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,319
partisan they will tell me to leave so

90
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,479
neutrality goes with mediation

91
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,319
facilitation is a skill more than it is

92
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,199
a role you have your own interests you

93
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,759
haven't promised neutrality

94
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,759
to the group but you've promised or

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,560
you're offering to

96
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,479
facilitate a collective effort to deal

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,919
with whatever the conflict or the

98
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,039
problem

99
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:50,319
is sometimes a spoiler will show

100
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,800
themselves and they'll say I don't care

101
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,479
what this process is going to do I can't

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,960
accept anything less than x and you're

103
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,600
trying to have the parties be be

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,160
creative and generate new options that

105
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,680
will meet everybody's interests and this

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,319
person's proposal clearly will make it

107
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,160
impossible if they won't move off that

108
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,039
position we're not going to be part of

109
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,160
any agreement and there's nothing you

110
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,199
can say there's no song you can sing

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,599
that's going to get me to agree to

112
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,639
something where we don't get this or at

113
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,919
least this and there's a really very

114
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,880
specific

115
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,560
maneuver at that moment

116
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,000
that facilitators and mediators use and

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,280
I can only tell you from my own

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,680
experience it stops the flow of the

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,960
spoilers bad vibrations so when someone

120
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,440
says if I don't get at least this we're

121
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,199
out and the facilitator says well before

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,479
anybody responds you wouldn't want any

123
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,919
more than that if I can get the rest of

124
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,840
this group to do better than that for

125
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,319
you you you wouldn't want to be part of

126
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,160
that conversation you would be amazed at

127
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,199
the way the facial expressions of people

128
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,879
who've built up for a week they're

129
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,960
coming to this meeting and they're going

130
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,400
to unload and they know everybody's

131
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,919
going to be angry at them or hate them

132
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,759
but they've worked themselves up and we

133
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,720
have to have this cuz the moment they

134
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,720
say well no I wouldn't be averse to more

135
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,840
you say okay good so you need to join

136
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,160
the conversation you need to listen to

137
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,160
other people's interests we need to see

138
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,400
how much more value we can create and

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,319
then you can make a case for what you

140
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,039
need and let's see if we can't reframe

141
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,720
all of it is around moving them off that

142
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,919
position and I'm not suggesting

143
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,840
compromise so they got to take a minute

144
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,879
to process it and then they'll say

145
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,240
something like usually can you guarantee

146
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,039
that they'll get me something better

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,560
than that I said we can try I can't

148
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,879
guarantee anybody will get anything

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,319
right now but there's a really good

150
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,759
chance if everybody is

151
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,159
negotiating to try to meet their own

152
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,120
interests and others that we can do that

153
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,479
and they get up and leave because they

154
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,960
don't know what else to do they can't

155
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,879
admit that there might be in their

156
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,319
interest to stay because they've told

157
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,159
their people they were going to come

158
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,000
tonight and blast this thing and make

159
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,000
their position clear and too bad for

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,159
everybody else and

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,719
I don't know what they're going to say

162
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,959
to their people when they go back

163
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:40,240
they'll have some rationalization but

164
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:44,200
they were so put off by the facilitation

165
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,720
response that they um they just walked

166
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,600
away it's not clear they would never

167
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
come

168
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,120
back if this process is going to go on a

169
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,480
while as a facilitator I would certainly

170
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,079
call them after the meeting and say

171
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,120
anything that you can say about whether

172
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:04,120
you might might rejoin the group you're

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,120
cordially invited to come back to the

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,079
next meeting no discussion of what

175
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,440
happened necessary they sometimes will

176
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,880
leave and in some instance it's possible

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,160
to bring them back if you can make it

178
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,640
not a embarrassing or humiliating

179
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,040
process that's the facilitator's job

180
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,200
you're right to be concerned that there

181
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,800
might be spoilers your right to be

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,720
concerned that you're not interested in

183
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,760
helping to find some lowest common

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,200
denominator compromise that starts with

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,000
the spoiler dictating the outer limits

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,120
of what can be produced you don't want

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,800
to be part of that and I wouldn't either

188
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,800
I don't blame

189
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,320
[Music]

190
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:58,200
you a number of people said maybe

191
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,560
someday I might want to be a in a

192
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:06,040
facility of leadership position but um I

193
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:10,519
don't feel like I have the level of

194
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,959
self-control or or self-confidence uh to

195
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,920
take that role right now maybe there's

196
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,079
more things I can learn maybe there's

197
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,600
more things I can observe but I I don't

198
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:24,880
see myself now being able to do that my

199
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,720
response is well that's great that you

200
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,240
have that perspective on yourself

201
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,519
doesn't mean you can and add what skills

202
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,880
and competences need to be added doesn't

203
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,360
mean you have to sign off Forever on the

204
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,600
prospect of being in a facilitative

205
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,120
leadership role there are times in

206
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,079
people's work life where they're tapped

207
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:52,079
to play a leadership role and they may

208
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,639
not think they're ready and they say no

209
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,839
I don't see myself doing that that's

210
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,279
fine if that's not you then that's not

211
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,530
you I don't I don't see that as a ter

212
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,640
able

213
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,640
[Music]

214
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:15,560
problem one person described all of the

215
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,760
micro skills that I listed for you last

216
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,560
time as

217
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,040
values rather than skills as if somehow

218
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,560
they're about what you believe as

219
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,440
opposed to what you can do and um these

220
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,240
are skills

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,760
they're

222
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,040
learned uh you're not necessarily born

223
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,480
with them and they don't come just

224
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,040
because you've decided you want them uh

225
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,399
you have to work to build these micro

226
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,040
skills and the micro skills are give you

227
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,160
a repertoire I think it's a mistake to

228
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,279
think of them in the category of values

229
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,360
if you want to use facilitation in

230
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,800
consensus

231
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,399
building that's the set of

232
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,639
skills and you can't just wish it

233
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,320
you have to learn it or you have to work

234
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,959
with someone for a while who is already

235
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,079
more accomplished at it and a sort of

236
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,600
indirectly Apprentice so that you can

237
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,959
try it out and then begin to build your

238
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,959
self-confidence about being able to do

239
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,920
this several people

240
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,639
said while they could see themselves

241
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,519
becoming facilitative leaders they had

242
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:44,480
no clear idea right now of how you turn

243
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,760
a confrontation into a collaborative

244
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,920
problem solving circumstance they don't

245
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:53,680
see how you could make it happen and so

246
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,000
they're happy to be to see themselves as

247
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,639
facilitative Leaders but if that

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,279
includes transforming a conflict

249
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,440
into a collaborative problem

250
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,279
solving situation they just didn't think

251
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,240
that was possible what I'm going to say

252
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,560
is true regardless of whether we're in a

253
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:18,720
leadership context or not I want to take

254
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:21,160
you to the kind of moment that happens

255
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,600
when everybody shows up with their own

256
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,199
ideas about what the right design to

257
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,560
solve a problem would be and you decide

258
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,839
well let's use the next half hour to

259
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,360
brainstorm everybody still came with

260
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:40,000
their own idea somebody says let's just

261
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,279
take the next half hour and engage in

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,040
brainstorming now anybody who's done

263
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,160
that knows it just a couple of

264
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,000
preconditions for Effective

265
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,920
brainstorming everybody has to agree

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,480
that everything that's said is an idea

267
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,079
is a suggestion for this half hour we're

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:04,639
going to brainstorm in my practice is a

269
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:08,399
mediator my way of embodying the need to

270
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,320
move that confrontation into problem

271
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,480
solving is often if I'm sitting across

272
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,759
from someone I stand up and I take my

273
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,880
chair and I put it next to them say

274
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,680
let's see how many things we can think

275
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,279
of that we agree on that would be a good

276
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:31,320
idea in handling this I'm on your side

277
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:34,199
is what I'm going and saying I'm trying

278
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,759
to convert the confrontation into a

279
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:40,440
collaborative moment the idea of talking

280
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,600
about how you're going to talk is

281
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,120
crucial to transforming a conflict into

282
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,880
a collaborative moment I have to build a

283
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,160
different context right in front of us

284
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,160
while we're sitting there how can we

285
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,959
work together I know everybody's got

286
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,040
their own ideas here and we'll hear

287
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,639
about those but before we do that let's

288
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,440
let's just see what we agree on are good

289
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,959
ideas relative to solving this problem

290
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,000
let's brainstorm to brainstorm

291
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,320
effectively we need to hold off on

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,639
negative or evaluative comments we need

293
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,759
to just put as many thing up there as we

294
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,120
can there's a time limit for how long

295
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,720
we're going to do it nobody's committed

296
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,120
to anything just because they

297
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,040
contributed an idea so don't worry that

298
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,600
you're somehow implicitly committing to

299
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,040
something that you want want to move

300
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,040
away from that's about transforming a

301
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,000
built-in conflict to a collaborative

302
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,360
problem solving circumstance doesn't

303
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
guarantee agreement but the comments I

304
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,440
was seeing from people is I I just don't

305
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,600
see how I can be in the middle of a

306
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,800
conflict and be a useful facilitator

307
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,319
you've got to discuss the desire to do

308
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,560
that you've got to set some ground rules

309
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,560
some people may stay quiet the whole

310
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,519
brainstorming session CU they can't

311
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,920
adjust to that they're not flexible

312
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:07,120
enough you can facilitate the

313
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,680
transformation of a conflict situation

314
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,839
to a joint problem solving situation by

315
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,120
naming it as the thing you think the

316
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:19,680
group should try for a short time that's

317
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,240
one way of thinking about the

318
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,959
transformation from a conflict

319
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,120
situation another is to break up a

320
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:32,040
fairly large group into smaller groups

321
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,480
we work in four groups of three and come

322
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,199
up with the criteria for choosing a good

323
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,920
design to solve this problem 10 minutes

324
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,240
time's up what did you guys what did you

325
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,720
what did you what did you it's easier to

326
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,920
just have to work with three people than

327
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,480
11 others so we use that as a way of

328
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,800
buffering the pressures of the conflict

329
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:01,240
to try to move to transformation you're

330
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:04,120
thinking of a move and are doing it and

331
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,679
you're not worrying about whether people

332
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,880
are going to disagree with what you're

333
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,480
proposing and you're not worrying about

334
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
whether they're not going to like you

335
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,600
you're just ready to

336
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:22,520
try some things that will transform the

337
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,240
context if you don't know how you could

338
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,319
write now be a facilitative leader

339
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,000
because you don't know that you could be

340
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,600
comfortable enough in a conflict to help

341
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,919
the group transform it um you can learn

342
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,919
how to do that but you need some ideas

343
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:46,240
to begin to work with last point that

344
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:49,240
came from two people separately I think

345
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:53,760
this whole facilitation thing makes me

346
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,039
look soft I see myself as a principled

347
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,159
person who doesn't get pushed around

348
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,799
relative to what I believe is right I

349
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,480
believe what I believe I represent the

350
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,640
people I work with all I can suggest to

351
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,799
you is there are other ways of

352
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,240
accomplishing the goal of getting people

353
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,200
to support what you believe but at their

354
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,840
own

355
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,559
volition not because you tell them they

356
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,480
have

357
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:26,559
to and I would argue effective is in the

358
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:29,919
middle between soft and hard effective

359
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,200
is none of that matters I only care if

360
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,039
you perceive me effective in my role as

361
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,919
helping to get a good outcome for the

362
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,440
group in which everyone's interests are

363
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,360
met when someone says I I don't see

364
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,320
being in this kind of leadership role I

365
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,159
guess they see themselves more as some

366
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,240
of our new national

367
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,720
leaders where they assume that will tell

368
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,039
everybody what to do and everyone should

369
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,760
listen because they are the leader um

370
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,720
that's not the model I'm talking about

371
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,159
um I don't think the people in that role

372
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,440
are going to get very far but we'll see

373
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,919
in the United States over the next

374
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,760
couple of years whether that approach

375
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,080
gets anyone where they want to go

376
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,200
someone said it seems like there's lots

377
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,600
of pre-work needed to be a facilitative

378
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,840
leader before the Gathering of all the

379
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,039
parties and the answer to that is

380
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,760
absolutely yes and that's why you work

381
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:29,280
as a team and that's why you have other

382
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,960
people it's not just what you do at the

383
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,960
table it's what you do to create the

384
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,320
table I think one of the

385
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,280
challenges that I can see myself facing

386
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,559
as a facilitative leader is um ensuring

387
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,320
that all voices in the room are heard

388
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,320
equally while not kind of making it a

389
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,880
contrived process like I still want to

390
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
like maintain this like Spirit of

391
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,559
collaboration and people just like

392
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,880
openly exchanging ideas so do you have

393
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,520
some preliminary ideas of how to try

394
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,960
that that's not the

395
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,360
clunky way proposing different questions

396
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,640
maybe other questions that might involve

397
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,799
folks who haven't been speaking as much

398
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,840
but yeah I don't know open to any other

399
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,080
ideas too so we're in this context and

400
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,919
there's several people speaking a lot

401
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,120
and there's several people hardly

402
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,200
speaking and I feel it's my job for

403
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,120
everyone to be heard I'm just repeating

404
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,960
your premise and I say wait a minute

405
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,400
wait a minute we've only heard from a

406
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,200
few people

407
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,679
I really let let's let people who

408
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,360
haven't spoken yet have the floor so I

409
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,600
have now empowered those folks and I

410
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,919
going to stop anyone who's spoken before

411
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,520
from Talking literally that's what my

412
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,240
facilitative job is and sometimes that

413
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,880
will make it more

414
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,640
comfortable for someone who's been quiet

415
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,159
because they don't feel comfortable

416
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,400
jumping in when they want to that's one

417
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,200
idea another idea is to say everyone be

418
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,039
quiet for a few minutes everybody write

419
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,240
down two three answers to the question

420
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,480
that we've been talking about short just

421
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,200
short things I put a lot of people in

422
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,039
that situation I haven't singled one

423
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,240
person out if I'm not singling someone

424
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,880
out who's been quiet there's a better

425
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,080
chance of engaging them a third thing is

426
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,640
to say we've been talking about this for

427
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,679
45 minutes um I want to get a sense of

428
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,720
where the group stands let's just go

429
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,080
around everybody just 30 seconds where

430
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,039
do you stand on this so I am doing

431
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,679
things to encourage the ones who haven't

432
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,520
spoken I can't make them speak and I do

433
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,559
not want to call them and say you

434
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,559
haven't said anything yet Say Something

435
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:45,200
There are a whole series of ways you can

436
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,400
try to do that that I think are better

437
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,919
than either saying well they didn't want

438
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,559
to speak they didn't have to speak I

439
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,039
would say that for me the biggest

440
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,159
challenge would be patience and the

441
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,480
management of time I think that

442
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,000
sometimes this kind of discussions when

443
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,480
they don't have like an end time it's

444
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,760
really difficult to get people to agree

445
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,120
because the discussion can keep going

446
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,760
that's something that I would like

447
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,080
struggle with how to manage I think um

448
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,279
you're right to worry about it I think

449
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,080
every facilitator has to worry about

450
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,279
managing time their time and the group's

451
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,919
time if I'm entering into that kind of

452
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:26,600
situation I need another person in the

453
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:30,480
group to be timekeeper we could also

454
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:33,919
have a ground rule we could say look we

455
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,679
give everybody 3 minutes for a first

456
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,000
statement on anything where you're

457
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,320
recognized from the queue to speak next

458
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,400
I can use that as a device for dealing

459
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,799
with one time problem which is people

460
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,120
who talk too long I would not start a

461
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,799
meeting without an agenda which I sent

462
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,279
out ahead if you have an agenda for any

463
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,600
kind of a group you should have time

464
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,600
next to each item including what is the

465
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,720
ending time but this is about using

466
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,480
agendas and that's the leaders

467
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,640
responsibility tools for time management

468
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,440
for the group not just for for yourself

469
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,080
you're not making evaluations about what

470
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,640
were the good suggestions and the bad

471
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,360
suggestions and you're not

472
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,520
editorializing and leaving something out

473
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,919
because you don't agree with it those

474
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,760
are some simple often used tools by

475
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,080
facilitators to deal with the time

476
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,080
management problem

477
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,559
main challenge for me personally is how

478
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
to to deal with people that wants to

479
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,080
spoil the process it takes sometimes a

480
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,720
lot of

481
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:45,600
emotional resilience to keep myself in a

482
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,840
set of mind that could facilitate the

483
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,000
processes I think it's a challenge for

484
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,960
anyone when we are in a process that

485
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,679
goes on for a long time which is why um

486
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,480
most professional facilitators work in

487
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,200
pairs has to be someone that you trust

488
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,120
to be your Alter Ego I'm talking about

489
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,080
someone who can do everything you can do

490
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,320
as well as you can do it but you're

491
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,000
switching roles in order to let one

492
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,880
person rest and recharge and if people

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,760
are going to be spoilers and they're

494
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:23,240
very good at it I don't have a a a magic

495
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,600
solution if I put people on the record

496
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,399
of having to give the reasons for why

497
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,399
they're doing something they have to E

498
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,919
either lie but many people won't take

499
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:35,600
their spoilers role to the point of

500
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,880
lying because they know it will ruin

501
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,240
their reputation in that context for the

502
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,840
future nobody forgets that that person

503
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,760
lied and suddenly the spoiler strategy

504
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,039
Falls away and they become part of the

505
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,000
negotiation group a question that I have

506
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,880
is like not in the moment of being a

507
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,559
facilitator but like communicating that

508
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,840
out once the decision has been reached

509
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,919
maintaining like the Vigor of that

510
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,120
decision and seeing it through like how

511
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,320
do you kind of like maintain trust in

512
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,520
the process knowing that ultimately like

513
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,840
you don't have the final say you want to

514
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,520
be in charge of a written summary of

515
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,200
whatever the key outcome findings

516
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,760
agreement is and you want to draft it

517
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,600
and you want everybody in the group to

518
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,080
have a chance to comment on it and if

519
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,679
there are disagreements you may need to

520
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,720
reconvene the parties you can put your

521
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,960
name as the point of contact not the

522
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:38,000
author that's the point of contact at

523
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,600
the bottom and you want to give that to

524
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,960
the mayor and you want to

525
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:48,080
say anything not clear in this written

526
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,679
statement this is the group's statement

527
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,399
and then the mayor is going to go say

528
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,960
whatever the mayor wants but the

529
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:59,840
existence of a statement that the whole

530
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,159
group had a hand in saying okay to is

531
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,360
the best way of ensuring that what came

532
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,080
out of the group doesn't go through the

533
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,159
political meat grinder and come out in

534
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,960
unrelated ways the problem is that when

535
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,399
some of the parties become very rigid

536
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,000
and uh will not move from their stance

537
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:23,520
what can I do as a facilitative uh

538
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,760
leader my experiences are all based on

539
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,039
my government position if I am a

540
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,840
facilitative leader with without that

541
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,679
Authority what will be my role some

542
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,559
people in some

543
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,240
countries would not be able to accept

544
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,960
this informal leadership role while they

545
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,080
still held their government appointment

546
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,559
not true in the United States not true

547
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,320
in some countries but is true in some

548
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,159
countries but if that's not the problem

549
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:59,880
if you can do both you have to be really

550
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:02,720
clear with the participants I have this

551
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,559
responsibility and this obligation in

552
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,200
the world if there's a point of conflict

553
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,760
I would have to opt out and you have to

554
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,720
tell that in one way to the agency you

555
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,960
work for and you have to say to the

556
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,039
people who still want you to be in this

557
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,120
facilitative leadership role if there

558
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,440
comes a conflict I will tell all of you

559
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,120
that and I will bow out thank you for

560
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,640
participating in the four dinner

561
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,480
discussions we will make this available

562
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,320
uh hopefully it will be sitting on the

563
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,240
department's website and I also hope

564
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,720
that it does lead to the creation of

565
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,720
additional courses dealing with

566
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,320
leadership within the public sector that

567
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,960
DSP takes responsibility for maybe you

568
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,159
can become a

569
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,640
constituency to ask for something more

570
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,240
on that score and um I'm obviously

571
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,120
always available to talk with anybody

572
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,480
who wants to pick up on these issues

573
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,679
oneon-one

574
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,679
thanks good night

575
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:24,180
