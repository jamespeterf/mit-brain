1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
With school back in session here at MIT,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,520
some of the brightest minds in the world

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,600
are here starting their school year

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,840
aiming for their degrees in arguably the

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,639
most competitive academic environment in

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,719
America, if not the world at large.

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,240
These are some serious high achievers in

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,640
and out of the classroom we're talking

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,240
about here. Amongst the prospective

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,920
engineers, scientists, and

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,160
mathematicians on this campus with a

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,800
high achievement mindset includes grad

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,720
student Abby Lee from Canada. Lee,

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
always a high energy, high determination

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
kid for as long as memory serves, is

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,480
currently pursuing her master's degree

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,559
here on campus in the aerospace

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
engineering department. An athlete

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,399
throughout her high school and

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,399
undergraduate years, Lee had taken to

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
endurance sports. Currently a member of

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
the triathlon club here on campus, Lee

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
has set her sights on competing on more

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
triathlons.

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,559
So, when I got here, it was kind of like

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
that fresh start. What do I want to do?

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,160
What have I been missing in undergrad?

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,559
and I noticed that MIT has a triathlon

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
club and I loved the Olympic triathon I

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,480
did probably about six years ago now and

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,479
so I said okay let's join the triathlon

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,479
club and see where it takes me and I'd

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,640
known what an iron man was pretty much

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,799
my whole life um there was someone from

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
my undergrad who had set a world record

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,159
as well in Iron Man's and so it was kind

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
of in the back of my mind that it was

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,159
this really hard thing to do um maybe I

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,960
should start with a marathon that was

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
also going in my brain um but more and

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
more I talked about it with some of my

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
friends as a joke like hey What if I

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
just like tried to do this? Um, trained

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,400
a bit more with the club and kind of

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,520
dove straight into, you know, the life

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,360
of a triathlete.

47
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
>> If studying and experimenting her way

48
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
towards her master's degree in literal

49
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,200
out of thisworld work wasn't enough,

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,360
there's one more place that the name

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,840
Abby Lee may very well land. The

52
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,600
Guinness Book of World Records. Her goal

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
to become one of the first and the

54
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,560
youngest woman to compete in an Iron Man

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,119
triathlon on all six inhabited

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,880
continents. Iron Man triathlons are some

57
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,560
of the hardest in the world.

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,240
>> I think I try and ignore as much of the

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
outside world as I can. You know, I've

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,439
trained as much as I can. You know, like

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,360
maybe I could have trained more in one

62
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,799
or two sessions, but that's I can't go

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,560
back in time. I've already done that.

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
We're already at the start line. So, I

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,400
try and just think like, okay, what do I

66
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,080
need to focus on now uh in this race to

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
get me to that finish line? Keeping my

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,319
heart rate down, you know, enjoying the

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
scenery. I've gotten to travel the world

70
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,080
through, you know, this this world

71
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,000
record attempt. And so I kind of get to

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
see Spain and see Brazil and all of

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,680
these places I've never seen before. So

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
trying to absorb that a little bit, keep

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,800
the nerves down and, you know, keep

76
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,239
pushing. There are some moments

77
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
throughout this journey so far that have

78
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,080
been really, really hard. Um, I think

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
I've learned a lot about what I'm

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
capable of and that's been eye opening

81
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,599
for sure and really rewarding, but also

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
just trying to push myself through it

83
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,319
because at the end of the day, this is

84
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
something I really want to do and and

85
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm going to have to be the number one

86
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,319
person driving that.

87
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
>> Aby's determination to hit her goals and

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,519
then some has been something that has

89
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,959
stuck with her since childhood according

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
to her mother, Sharon.

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,879
>> Um, never stop Abby. I think that's a

92
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,680
big huge thing with Abby. If she thinks

93
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,239
she can do it, she's going to do it. And

94
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
that's determination from probably six,

95
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,760
seven years of age, nothing has stopped

96
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,440
her. So I think that with sport and

97
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,159
school, she is a high achiever. Nothing

98
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,680
stops her. No one stops her. Any

99
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,760
challenge doesn't stop.

100
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,920
>> Paige Forester, Aby's lab partner,

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
workout buddy, and close friend, says

102
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
that that drive is infectious.

103
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
>> I mean, honestly, it's been like so

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,800
inspiring. I feel like Abby is like one

105
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
of, you know, your friends, like they're

106
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,360
supposed to be your peers, but I think

107
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
it's really important that you look up

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,120
to them and like Abby is somebody that I

109
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,239
just admire so much. Um, like at the end

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
of the day, like when you really think

111
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
about what she's doing, it's amazing.

112
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,680
Um, but like dayto-day, like getting to

113
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,920
work out with her, she's probably my

114
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
favorite person to work out with because

115
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,760
she's crazy and she'll do anything that

116
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,280
I ask her to. Um, like if I propose a

117
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
150 mi ride, she's like, "Yeah, let's do

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
it. Like, let's go right now." Um, but

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
actually like more importantly than

120
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
that, I think Abby is like one of the

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,200
few people I know that is super humble.

122
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,560
So if she's like the best at something,

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,799
if she's not the best at something,

124
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,799
she's always like open about that and

125
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,560
that will actually talk about it. And I

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,799
really appreciate that because I never

127
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,560
feel with her like there's any

128
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
competition between us. Like I just love

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
to work out with her because um we're

130
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,560
just like proud of each other. So like

131
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
when we are in the pool or we're on the

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840
bike like we're just hyping each other

133
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
up the whole time. And that's actually

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,160
true. like I I don't I don't find that

135
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
with um people. I feel like Aby's just

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,120
really unique in that sense. So, she's I

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
love working out with her. She's

138
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
awesome.

139
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,280
>> With this global goal, she is halfway

140
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,199
home. Three down, three to go. So far,

141
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
Lee has taken to the Iron Man course in

142
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,280
South Africa back in March of 2025,

143
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,440
Brazil in June of 2025, and Spain the

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
following month. The European leg was an

145
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
especially difficult race for her as

146
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,479
fatigue and a possible stomach bug

147
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,720
started to set in.

148
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,199
And so that race, hardest day of my

149
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
life. Um, and I was grinding from

150
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,360
kilometer 25 onwards to finish that

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,520
race. So to put that in perspective, my

152
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
body was begging me for a nap. And I

153
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
still had to tell it, you have 155 more

154
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
kilometers on the bike and then you have

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,960
to go run a marathon and you have to

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
meet these cut off times or you this

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
won't be a certified race. So it was a

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,320
lot of just mentally pushing myself,

159
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,479
reminding myself that today is

160
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
temporary. um you know, if I can just

161
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,759
get to this finish line, I don't have to

162
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,479
be back in Spain again. I don't have to

163
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,160
do that European race again. Um it was

164
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,400
really rewarding to cross the finish

165
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
line, but toughest moment of my life for

166
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,000
sure.

167
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
>> So, what's next for Abby Lee? Three more

168
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,880
Iron Man triathlons on the docket,

169
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,120
including one in October of 2025, the

170
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,440
Iron Man World Championships in Kona,

171
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
Hawaii. Before she heads west, she needs

172
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,400
a big piece of the triathlon puzzle, a

173
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,759
triathlon bike. My biggest barrier right

174
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,919
now actually is I don't have a bike.

175
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,000
So, I flew to Brazil with a used bike,

176
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
but it was about a $1,200 triathlon

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,919
bike. I was super super excited to get

178
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,479
to use it and it arrived broken. Um, and

179
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
that was a killer. In Brazil, I had

180
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
scrambled to get there. There was some

181
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
travel hiccups and I opened the box and

182
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
the bike was broken and I didn't know

183
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
what to do. And thankfully the

184
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
Brazilians some of the nicest people

185
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,280
I've ever met and four people were like,

186
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
"What size are you? We'll lend you a

187
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,479
bike." Like it just was such a

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479
demonstration of how incredible this

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,560
community is. Um, and I just felt so

190
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,840
supportive. So, I did get to borrow a

191
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
bike and then I had to rent one for

192
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,000
Spain, but I don't currently have a bike

193
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,600
to train on. I'm a grad student, so I'm

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,919
trying my best to accomplish this all

195
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,560
off of my siphon, which is not super

196
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,240
forgiving. Um, definitely great, but not

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,000
not maybe where I need it to be for

198
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,440
this. So, trying to budget for that

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,600
bike, but I I don't have something to

200
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
train on now. Maybe I'll rent for Kona.

201
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
Um, but that's the biggest hiccup for

202
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,520
me. Trying to get onto a TT like

203
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,880
triathlon bike before that race and and

204
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,319
get the feel for it, maybe get it fit

205
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,639
for me is huge.

206
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,520
>> For Abby Lee, a student, an engineer,

207
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,000
and a triathlete, the sky or really

208
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
anything certainly isn't the limit.

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
>> Was it a scary watch? Was it scary

210
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,400
watching it for three of them already?

211
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Yes. and Spain was not fun to have to

212
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
hear what she had to go through. But I

213
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,840
think when she came through the other

214
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,479
end of that and said nothing in her life

215
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,160
will be that hard, I truly believe it.

216
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440
Mind over matter is what got Abby

217
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
through it and that'll get her through

218
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,360
that. Once she steps foot onto the

219
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
starting line, the time for training is

220
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,680
over and it's all about the race at hand

221
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,840
for Abby Lee. With three more Iron Man

222
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,759
triathlons to go, the path will not be

223
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
easy. But with the support of the

224
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,720
friends, family, and classmates cheering

225
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
her on near and far, success has already

226
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
been achieved.

227
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,639
>> So, of course, I would like to say the

228
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,960
MIT community has already done so much.

229
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,319
I think just surrounding myself with so

230
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,520
many brilliant and like-minded

231
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,840
individuals has been huge. Just the MIT

232
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
tri club, my friends, my labmates are

233
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
some of the most driven people I've ever

234
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,120
met, and it's infectious. And that's

235
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,960
been really great to see. In terms of

236
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,639
the the community itself, if anyone

237
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,800
knows, you know, great resources for

238
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
Iron Man, places to to find that

239
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,479
equipment, places to find the fuel that

240
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll need for those races, and anyone

241
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
who's open to make partnerships, like

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
that's definitely something I'm looking

243
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,039
towards. And just trying to have fun

244
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,199
with it and seeing who I can inspire

245
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,879
along the way. You know, I always hear

246
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
from people, "Oh my gosh, you did an

247
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,639
Iron Man. That's incredible. I'd never

248
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,960
be able to do that. I don't run." But I

249
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,120
didn't run either. I didn't bike. My

250
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,199
first road bike ever I bought in

251
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
September from the MIT police auction

252
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,759
cuz I couldn't afford anything else. And

253
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,080
so I'm hoping to show people it's maybe

254
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
not about being the best at what you're

255
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
doing, but just trying just getting out

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,599
there. And so, you know, if the MIT

257
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,680
community has anyone who's looking for

258
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,519
for some inspiration on getting started

259
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,279
and just really trying your best and

260
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,200
setting lofty goals and not being afraid

261
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,040
to fail, I'd say like come chat with me.

262
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,279
I'd love to help. If you would like to

263
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,680
help Abby in her Iron Man triathlon

264
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,200
journey, visit her website for more

265
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,640
