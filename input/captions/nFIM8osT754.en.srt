00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello everyone. My name is Jack Louu and

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
I'm the CPO and co-founder of

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,320
Tristarai. So my co-founder, he grew up

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
spending a lot of time at his dad's

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
plastic manufacturing plant. He he

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,680
distinctly remembers the noise, the

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,599
smell of melting resin, and more

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,439
importantly, his dad constantly running

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,640
around trying to solve issues with his

10
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,880
production. His dad was able to solve

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
this through instinct, through

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,480
experience, and honestly just good

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
old-fashioned hustle.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,600
But he always thought and he always told

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
Seem, my co-founder, that if there was a

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
way for him to see what was happening on

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,280
his production floor in real time

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
instead of trying to solve problems

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,239
after, that would be a game changer. And

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:02,320
that's what stuck with us and

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,479
um how we based our company on. So um as

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,159
we found out as we went to the industry

23
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,000
um he wasn't the only problem with this

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,200
uh only only person with this problem

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,080
right and after years at MIT and at auto

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,640
manufacturing plants we saw that this uh

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,040
most people still operate on making

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,080
decisions on a bad or incomplete

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,479
feedback cycle and just lack of

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,360
information and um and this gap in

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,079
information is kind of what cost these

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,920
companies billions s in lost uh

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,360
production in scrap and just general

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,840
inefficiencies and uh that's what we aim

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,240
to

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,640
tackle. So uh basically uh the idea is

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,119
that we try to fill this gap of

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
information by understanding the the uh

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,520
lack the biggest lack which is the human

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
element of any production cycle. uh

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
there's no real good in a way to get

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
that information other than

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,920
self-reporting which is just inherently

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,159
unreliable and what drives these uh gaps

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,280
of

46
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,600
misinformation. Uh at the end of the day

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,720
um we come in uh we install our vision

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,879
system and we put we use that to inspect

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,599
the production line. We understand that

50
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:20,400
the entire production process um and if

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,720
any of the operators kind of go outside

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,520
of the standard operating procedure,

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,440
we're able to flag that uh give the

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,440
instant alert to the operator and that

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,680
gives the opportunity to fix that in

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,160
real time instead of trying to go back

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,959
and resolve it after.

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,400
Um and so the the underlaying technology

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,400
behind this uh this monitoring system is

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,680
that we essentially have these action

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,920
building blocks. Um and in a way you can

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,400
think of it as Legos where we understand

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,959
these complex motions through basic

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,040
movement and being able to restitch that

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,959
in a different combination to detect

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
other complex actions. And that's how

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,040
we're able to map it directly over to

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,720
their production process and the

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
production cycle.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,680
Um and um and because of this like

71
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,920
uh mix of smaller or more basic movement

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,599
blocks that we can assemble it into uh

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,400
fit it to any uh application uh in uh

74
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,440
any kind of environment.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,959
Um, so in in one of our plastic plants,

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
as you can imagine, that's where we

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,080
started, uh, based on my co-founder's

78
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,959
dad, uh, we we found that we were able

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,760
to reduce the, uh, defective and scrap

80
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,879
rate by over 60% in over just a month

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,879
by, uh, allowing them to react in real

82
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,440
time instead of going back and fixing

83
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,640
things. And uh in another one of our

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,480
customers that makes uh auto radiators,

85
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,560
they're essentially every time we catch

86
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,239
a defect as it's happening, they're

87
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,120
saving tens of thousands in lost

88
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
production in scrap. And not only that,

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
you're saving them essentially over 10

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
hours of rework. As you can imagine,

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
anything that you build incorrectly, you

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
have to unbuild and then rebuild. So

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,120
that basically triples your production

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,759
time for each of those parts.

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,040
Um, and more importantly, I I think more

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,040
than just that, we're helping the

97
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
engineers and the operators have more

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
visibility. They don't feel like they're

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,080
flying blind when they're uh doing their

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,160
shifts day day in day out. And it gives

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
them a tool that makes their lives a lot

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
easier because it's a second pair of

103
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,040
eyes and it allows them to resolve

104
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,800
things without feeling the effects of

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,080
incorrectly doing something later on.

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,560
Um, at the end of the day, I I think

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
like our

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,240
fundamental drive for what we're

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,400
building is that we're trying to build

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
something that I think our co-founders

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,840
would have loved to have. You know,

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,440
these people, they don't care about

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,600
computer vision. They don't care about

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,800
cameras. They don't care about

115
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,040
algorithms. What they want is ability to

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,120
react in real time and full visibility

117
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
in what's happening on their plan 4. And

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
at the end of the day, it's it's just

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,840
about making manufacturing smarter,

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
leaner, and uh more agile and resilient

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,840
to, you know, everything that's going on

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
in the world. And uh so all I ask of you

123
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,280
is if you think this application or this

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
technology can improve uh things at your

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
company, please come and speak to us and

126
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,360
we'll love to have a conversation. Thank

127
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,360
you very much.
