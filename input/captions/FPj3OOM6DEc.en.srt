1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,480
So remember last lecture I introduced

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,880
you to the idea of tailbounds where we

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,800
want to get a rough handle on how likely

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,119
it is for a random variable to be far

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
away from its expectation.

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,720
So we talked about uh you know marov's

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,279
bound, chbachev's bound and each of

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,000
these used more and more information

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,840
about the random variables as a way to

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,640
get a better bound on the tail

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
probabilities. So marov just used that

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,800
the random variable was non- negative

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120
and then we already could bound the

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,680
probability that it was double its

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,440
expectation. Chbashev we used its

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
variance which is a measure of how

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,320
spread out the random variable is and

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,760
you know today we're going to do you

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,440
know the the most important tool uh the

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,520
highest powered tool which is called the

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,080
churnoff bound.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
So this is going to use that not only

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,600
you know do we know properties about X's

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,760
expectation and its variance but that X

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
itself is composed of the sum of

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,960
mutually independent random variables.

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,320
So we'll see that implicitly in the

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,159
proof of this we're going to be using

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,240
not just the first moment which is the

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,759
mean and the second moment but we're

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,040
going to be using all of the higher

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,119
moments at once. Uh but the basic setup

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
for the turnoff bound at least the plain

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,320
vanilla version is remember from last

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,240
time we have these random variables xi

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,880
that are mutually independent. So this

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,880
is critical turnoffbound only works when

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
you have mutual independence not just

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,360
pair-wise. It's completely false

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,759
otherwise. And these XI's we're going to

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,720
assume for simplicity that they're Berni

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,360
random variables. So each of the XI's is

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,759
probability PI of being one and is

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,159
otherwise zero. And just to have some

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,640
notation, we'll let mu denote the

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,119
expectation of X, which is the sum of

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
all the XI's. But of course, that's the

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,239
same thing as the sum of all of the PIs.

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,800
So the turnoff bound comes in a lot of

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,280
different flavors. Let me state a few

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,879
different versions you might care about.

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
First, there's what's called the upper

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,720
tail, which this is the probability that

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,680
the random variable is way larger than

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,319
its expectation. So for all delta

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,520
greater than zero, we can look at the

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,360
probability that X is larger than its

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,800
mean by a 1 + delta factor. So you

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
should think about delta here as being

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,000
something like 0.1, right? Uh the chance

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,280
that this happens is exponentially

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
small.

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,720
And it depends on this delta parameter

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
of course, but then it also depends on

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
mu.

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
So this is a complicated algebraic

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
expression, but it's important to have

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,120
some intuition for what's going on here.

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,879
So if I take a fair coin and I flip it,

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
I know the probability that it's heads

71
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,480
is 50, right? Is 50%.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,640
And you know, intuitively, if I flip my

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,360
coin a whole bunch of times and keep

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,599
track of how many heads I get, I should

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
expect that the empirical average of the

76
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,800
number of heads is very quickly going to

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,800
50/50, right? Maybe if I flip it three

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
times, you know, I'll get two heads out

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,519
of three and that'll be far away from

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
50/50. But the larger the number of

81
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
flips, well, the more it should be

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,159
driven to going back to the average,

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,120
right? That's what things like the weak

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,879
law of large numbers are telling us. And

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
you know the way that this shows up is

86
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,920
really in this mean mew because as the

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,480
number of flips n gets larger and

88
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
larger, my mean is larger and larger. So

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,239
the chance that I have 10% too many

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,879
heads is going down exponentially

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
with the number of flips I make. So this

92
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,200
is the critical distinction between the

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,000
churnoff bound and things like the weak

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,319
law of large numbers is that here our

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,720
failure probability the chance that you

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,920
know we're outside this range where we

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,000
think it lands is exponentially small in

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,080
n whereas for things like the weak law

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,120
of large numbers it was only inverse

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,359
polomially small in n. So that's called

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
the upper tail because all I care about

102
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,320
is the probability that x is too big

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,120
compared to mu. there's a corresponding

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,199
lower tail. The only reason we separate

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
these two things out is because they

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
have a slightly different dependence on

107
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,080
delta. So here it really only makes

108
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:40,479
sense to have a delta that's between 0

109
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:44,000
and one. And now the probability that x

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,360
is at most 1 minus delta * mu that I get

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
too few heads instead is again something

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,240
that's exponentially small. it just has

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,240
doesn't have this two plus delta in the

114
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,720
base. So it looks like this instead.

115
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,919
So this is the lower tail. And there's

116
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,160
also a way that you can combine them if

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,880
you don't have to worry that much about

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,400
what the dependence on delta is. So what

119
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,960
I claim is that when you just put these

120
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,680
bounds together, so for all delta

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,720
between 0 and one, you can just write it

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,520
instead. The probability that X minus mu

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,919
an absolute value is larger than delta

124
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,240
mu. So it's more than delta mu away from

125
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:31,759
its expectation goes down like 2 * e

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,560
minus mu delta^ 2 over 3. So turnoff

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,960
bounds aren't really just one bound.

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,720
There's a whole family of bounds. The

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,000
ones I'm stating here, you know, these

130
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,400
are for bernoli random variables. and we

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,919
have you know an upper tail, a lower

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
tail, a combined bound. Uh in fact there

133
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
are versions of churnoff bounds where

134
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
the XI's aren't Berni random variables.

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,320
There are other kinds of random

136
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,120
variables you know with bounded second

137
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,720
moments. So what you know the way you

138
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,320
should think about turnoff bounds is I'm

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,919
going to give you one proof of the

140
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,759
turnoff bound. It'll be in this

141
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,960
restricted case of Berni random

142
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,120
variables. The same basic proof works

143
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,280
for a lot of other exotic variants of a

144
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,720
churnoff bound. And when you need a

145
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
different kind of turnoff bound like

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
your XI's are not Bernoli, you just look

147
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,280
it up and quote the bound. So the key

148
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,759
thing is really just to understand one

149
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,919
of these bounds, how the proof works and

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
intuitively why the proof should extend

151
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,400
beyond literally the assumptions I'm

152
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,280
making. So are there any questions about

153
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,479
it?

154
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,400
Okay, so this is uh probably the most

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,720
complicated proof uh we've done up until

156
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
this point and it's something which

157
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
we're going to spend a bit of time in

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,120
recitation thinking about. Yeah.

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,479
>> Uh does mu have to be positive?

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,960
>> Uh so mu is positive here just by

161
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,120
assumption because my x i are non-

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
negative. I mean if mu were zero it

163
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
would be kind of trivial. So you have to

164
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,440
be a bit more careful when you have a

165
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,599
churnoff bound with random variables

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,520
whose uh which are not non- negative and

167
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,960
yeah you have to shift and scale it and

168
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,960
you'll see through the proof that a lot

169
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,039
of these things can be done. It's just

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,919
that it changes subtleties like what

171
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
exactly happens in the exponent here. So

172
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,639
there might be, you know, other

173
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
quantities that show up, but the

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,520
important thing is really the mu and the

175
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,199
delta dependence and then the other

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,840
scalers might change in different ways,

177
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,840
but good question. All right, so we're

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,919
going to cover this in more detail in

179
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,599
the recitation, but I'm warning you. So

180
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,479
this will be one of the most complicated

181
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,000
proofs we've done up until this point.

182
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,080
But what I'm going to try and do is I'm

183
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,800
going to explain the high-level strategy

184
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,639
for the proof and that way we can then

185
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,120
try and fill in some of the technical

186
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,520
details, the actual estimates to get the

187
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
overall strategy to work. So what I

188
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,599
really want to focus on is like how

189
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
we're going to prove this bound at a

190
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,639
high level because you know in all

191
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,319
proofs there are you know the hard parts

192
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,319
of how you're going to fit the pieces

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
together and then there are the tedious

194
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,800
parts of like how do you do the literal

195
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,440
computations to execute the different

196
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,160
steps of your strategy. So let's start

197
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,319
with the main idea and this will be a

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,960
very similar trick to what happened when

199
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,240
we proved the chbashev bound. So let's

200
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,400
say I have my random variable X and for

201
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,919
some A that I'm going to set later

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,240
because I'm going to set it to be equal

203
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,800
to this you know 1 plus delta mu or 1

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,399
minus delt you know that kind of thing.

205
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
Let's say I'm interested in the

206
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,760
probability that X is very large that

207
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,320
it's at least some value A. I claim that

208
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,959
this is the same thing as the

209
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,519
probability that E to the BX is at least

210
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:52,080
e to the BA. And this is true for all B

211
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,320
that are non- negative.

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,839
Okay, so this is the first key trick. So

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
remember when we had the proof of the

214
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,160
chbashev bound, you know, chbashev

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
doesn't assume any kind of non-

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,240
negativity about the random variable.

217
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
And I had this trick where when I wanted

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
to look at the probability that X is too

219
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,640
large, I squared both sides and then I

220
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,720
defined a new random variable Y. And I

221
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
said that that random variable Y is non-

222
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
negative. And I just said those two

223
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
probabilities are the same because

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,519
they're literally the same event. So

225
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,440
that's exactly what's happening here.

226
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,080
You can take B to be one just for

227
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,040
simplicity. I'm just saying that, you

228
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,000
know, these two events are the same. X

229
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,720
being at least A is the same thing as E

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
to the X being at least E to the A. And

231
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,640
that's just because you know E is a nice

232
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,640
you know monotone function, right? And

233
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,040
this is true now even if I put in a

234
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,440
scalar B in there as long as B is non-

235
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,680
negative. So is everyone on board with

236
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
this? This is fine.

237
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,240
>> Yeah.

238
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,080
>> Why doesn't B need to be strictly

239
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,080
greater than zero? Uh,

240
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,120
I don't know. Let's just make it strict.

241
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
I'm not going to use the equality

242
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
anyways and we'll get into a

243
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,240
technicality, but thanks for the catch.

244
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,120
Any other questions?

245
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,320
All right. So, that's the first idea.

246
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,720
So, you know, just to belabor the point,

247
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,800
right? So, why is this true?

248
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,440
It's true because e to the y is an

249
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,440
increasing function.

250
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,279
And so that really means that these two

251
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,959
events are the same. The set of all x's

252
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,160
where x is at least you know a are the

253
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,640
same as the set of all x's where e to

254
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,480
the bx is at least e to the b a. So

255
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,640
they're literally the same event. So

256
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,120
this is the first thing in our trick,

257
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,519
right? And so now exactly like in the

258
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
proof of the chbashev bound, what I'm

259
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,839
going to do is I'm going to define a new

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,640
random variable y which is e to the bx.

261
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,360
Right? So this is a really interesting

262
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,079
trick. Just like for chevb I defined a

263
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,640
new random variable y which was the you

264
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,560
know square compared to the expectation.

265
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,959
Now I'm doing this funny thing where I

266
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,880
take the exponential of my random

267
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,399
variable and I'm using that to define

268
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,320
this new random variable y. Right?

269
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:36,519
So now

270
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,519
just by construction y is non- negative

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,200
right it's a non- negative random

272
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,200
variable which means we can apply

273
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
markoff.

274
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,279
So let's apply markoff and see what we

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
get.

276
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:04,079
So the probability that you know X is uh

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:09,279
at least a is at most

278
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:12,320
e expectation of e to the bx over e to

279
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,279
the b a.

280
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,720
Okay. So what is this doing right here

281
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,279
is I'm just using two facts. So first of

282
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,639
all, this one right here is just the

283
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,240
probability that Y is at least E to the

284
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,800
BA. And I'm using the fact that you know

285
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,519
if I had probability of Y at least E to

286
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,000
the BA, this would be my expectation of

287
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,040
Y. This would be my threshold. So this

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,680
is just markoff. And now I'm using this

289
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,920
fact that these two probabilities are

290
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,279
the same to replace my left hand side

291
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,600
with the probability X is at least a.

292
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,680
So this is subtle, right? Does everyone

293
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,720
follow that?

294
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,560
Any questions?

295
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,120
Give me a thumbs up if it makes sense.

296
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,839
Okay, good. All right. So now it turns

297
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,959
out that uh the quantity on the right

298
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,399
hand side, this thing right here, this

299
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,560
is important for its own right.

300
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,680
It actually has a very special name and

301
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,240
a special role. So before we go on uh

302
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,720
with the proof, let me explain what this

303
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,560
quantity is and why it's so important

304
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,440
because otherwise it'll seem a bit too

305
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,800
magical. So this is called the moment

306
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:33,040
generating function.

307
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,760
So the moment generating function

308
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,839
you know we've seen generating functions

309
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,160
in the context of cominotaurics, right?

310
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,079
And here it's a generating function in a

311
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,320
different disguise because it'll be

312
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,920
keeping track of other things. So when

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,079
we talked about generating functions in

314
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,839
the context of combinotaurics, you know,

315
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,560
the coefficients that showed up in

316
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,360
different powers of a different powers

317
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,639
of x that kept track of things we wanted

318
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,560
to count. So you know it turns out that

319
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,519
this quantity right here keeps track of

320
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,360
uh you know important quantities of x.

321
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,160
But you know the way it keeps track of

322
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,560
it is that there's a free parameter B.

323
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,160
So what I really care about is how this

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,880
term depends on B. And so it turns out

325
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,920
that the series expansion I get in terms

326
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,079
of B keeps track of a lot of interesting

327
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
properties of the random variable.

328
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,680
That's why we call this the moment

329
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,360
generating function. So the moment

330
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,079
generating function of X is literally

331
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,519
just the thing on the right hand side.

332
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,920
We denote it by MX of B and it's equal

333
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,240
to the expectation of e to the bx.

334
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
So even though x is our random variable,

335
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,240
that's not the thing that shows up in

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,120
the moment generating function because

337
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,959
I'm taking the expectation over x. The

338
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,880
important thing is really just how that

339
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,560
expectation depends on b. So let's you

340
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
know tease out these properties of the

341
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,760
moment generating function just to get

342
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,399
some intuition for what properties

343
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,040
of uh you know the random variable this

344
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,839
proof of the churnoff bound is using. So

345
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,839
let's do some intuition.

346
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,040
So first of all mx of b is a function of

347
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,120
b.

348
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,440
In fact, you know, one way that we could

349
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,639
think about it is we could take the

350
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,720
tailaylor expansion of e to the bx,

351
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,800
right? So if we take the tailor

352
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,279
expansion of e to the bx because inside

353
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,519
the expectation x is just you know some

354
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,600
particular realization

355
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:49,680
and it could look like 1 + you know bx

356
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:53,839
plus 1 over 2 factorial b ^2 x^2

357
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,639
plus 1 over 3 factorial b cub x cubed

358
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,639
and so on. Okay.

359
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,399
So if we just take the tailor expansion

360
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,920
of our exponential function, this is

361
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,639
what we get. And now we can use

362
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,959
linearity of expectation and this is the

363
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:14,320
same thing as the sum from i= 0 to

364
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:19,519
infinity of 1 / i factorial b to the i

365
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:22,240
the expectation of x to the i.

366
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,240
So this is what I promised you, right?

367
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,800
So the moment generating function is

368
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,639
this generating function that uh depends

369
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,000
on B and what is you know the first term

370
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,959
of this well it's trivial when I equals

371
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,800
Z right because I just get one out of it

372
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,920
but now when I do the you know the next

373
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,800
term corresponding to I equals 1 what am

374
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,519
I getting well the coefficient of B is

375
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,600
the expectation of X

376
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,160
and when I look at I equals 2 it's not

377
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,040
the variance of X but it's the second

378
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,040
moment of X and so on and the third

379
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,880
moments. So the moment generating

380
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,279
function keeps track of the moments of X

381
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,120
and in fact what I claim is that you can

382
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,360
extract the uh moments from the moment

383
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,039
generating function.

384
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,360
So we'll see how this works just in a

385
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,360
simple case

386
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,199
and this will parallel what Peter taught

387
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,600
you about uh generating functions. So,

388
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,640
how could I go about extracting a

389
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,840
particular moment

390
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,559
of X from the moment generating

391
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,520
function?

392
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,280
Well, in particular, the way that I can

393
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,160
recover the first moment of X is just by

394
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,160
taking my

395
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
moment generating function,

396
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,600
taking the partial derivative with

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,520
respect to B and then evaluating it at B

398
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
equals Z.

399
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,919
All that would do is it would kill the

400
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,559
first term that's just a constant and I

401
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,120
just pick up the expectation,

402
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,200
right? And then when I evaluated at B

403
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,919
equals Z all of the higher order terms

404
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,039
would disappear. Uh so you can check

405
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,440
that this really does give you um you

406
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,400
know what you want right

407
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,400
in particular the partial with respect

408
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,160
to b of mx of b we can just apply it to

409
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,039
this expression that I wrote out right

410
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,640
here. And you know that's the same thing

411
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:34,880
as the partial with respect to b of 1 +

412
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:40,720
b e x and so on. And then we'll get this

413
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:43,760
expression that looks like e x + b e x

414
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,360
squared and so on. And we evaluate at b

415
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,520
equals z. We get exactly what we wanted.

416
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,200
So for example, how could I extract the

417
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,799
second moment of you know X from the

418
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,440
moment generating function just to make

419
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,440
sure we're on the same page.

420
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
>> Yeah.

421
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,000
>> Second derivative. Just have to be

422
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
careful with the constants but they all

423
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,760
work out uh nicely here. So you know

424
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,760
this gives us some intuition about you

425
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,000
know I told you that the churnoff bound

426
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,320
would be using higher order moments of

427
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,080
my random variable. I'm not just using

428
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,799
the first and second moment like I am

429
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,799
with Marov and Chevbashev and the way

430
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,039
that I'm using it is really what's

431
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,280
happening on the right hand side. That

432
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,200
moment generating function contains all

433
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,000
of the information about X that we'll

434
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,039
want. Okay.

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,200
So now uh let's get back to the proof

436
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,000
and figure out you know why this is a

437
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,000
productive thing to do.

438
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,760
So here's our first key lema. So in the

439
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,640
setting of the churnoff bound where we

440
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:58,160
have X equals the sum of these XI's

441
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,520
and all these XI's

442
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,520
are mutually independent.

443
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,320
Then what I claim is that the moment

444
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,960
generating function of X evaluated at B

445
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,280
is the same thing as the product of all

446
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,720
of the constituent moment generating

447
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:27,720
functions for each one of the XI's all

448
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,720
evaluated at the same thing B.

449
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,159
So that's the first key statement. This

450
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,039
is why the moment generating function

451
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,120
plays nicely with mutual independence is

452
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,880
because it decomposes as a product of a

453
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,919
lot of things. Was there a question? No.

454
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,520
Okay. All right. So the proof for this

455
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,000
is very simple. It's just about

456
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,240
unpacking you know what's happening in

457
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,240
this definition.

458
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,240
So by definition and our assumption

459
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,559
we just have to remember what the moment

460
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,799
generating function is. So mx of b is

461
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,159
defined to be the expectation of e to

462
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:12,240
the bx that's where it came from. And

463
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:17,039
then we can remember what exactly x is

464
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,000
right because x is the sum from i= 1 to

465
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,400
n of the x i's.

466
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,720
And now what should I do in my last step

467
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,520
right here? So how am I going to

468
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,520
proceed? Yeah.

469
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,679
>> That's right. So just to you know

470
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,120
belabor this right. So let me write it

471
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,720
out you know in two steps. First I can

472
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,679
write this as the product from i= 1 to n

473
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,200
of each of these ebxis

474
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:56,240
right. But now the crucial thing is that

475
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,480
by mutual independence of the x i's

476
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,799
I actually know that not only are the x

477
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,559
i independent but so are the e to the

478
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,559
bxis as well. Right? And so by mutual

479
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,559
independence

480
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,200
we can write we can pull the product

481
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,919
outside. This is where I crucially need

482
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,840
not just pair-wise independence and I'll

483
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,960
get the product of all of these

484
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,880
expectations of e to the bxi.

485
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,720
And that's literally the product of

486
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,679
their moment generating functions

487
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,679
exactly as I promised. So that's the

488
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
first lema, the first key thing we need

489
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,799
for the ingredient for the turnoff.

490
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,039
Okay,

491
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,039
any questions.

492
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,960
So you know this is the basic

493
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,679
architecture of the proof for the

494
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,600
turnoff bound is that you know we

495
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,200
defined this new random variable y

496
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,360
that's the exponential of x and then you

497
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,960
know when we applied markov we ended up

498
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,720
with the moment generating function the

499
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,320
right hand side and the moment

500
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,400
generating function turns into the

501
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,200
product of all of the constituent moment

502
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
generating functions. So now what we

503
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,720
need to do is we need to actually

504
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,440
estimate the individual terms that go

505
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
into the right hand side. So now you

506
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,919
know the whole name of the game is

507
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,919
executing the strategy and figuring out

508
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,000
what the right hand side looks like in

509
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,080
this one bound that I wrote down right

510
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,280
there. So now we're actually going to

511
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,799
use the properties of like the pis. So

512
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,799
let me tell you the second key lema

513
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,799
which will be our second main ingredient

514
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,200
in the proof.

515
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
So let's figure out what these moment

516
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,120
generating functions are for each of

517
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,200
these x subis.

518
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,200
So here's what I claim. This is our lema

519
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
2.

520
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,720
So if x subi

521
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,520
is one or zero again with probability

522
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,480
pi and zero otherwise. So same as the

523
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,440
assumptions of the turnoff bound. Then

524
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,799
what I claim is that the moment

525
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:15,440
generating function of XI evaluated at B

526
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:18,880
is at most e to the pi e to the b minus

527
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,720
one. Okay. So this is now just the

528
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,200
numerical value for it. Obviously it has

529
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,760
to depend on what the probability pi is

530
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,919
of x i being one for that bernoli random

531
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,760
variable. And then it also depends on

532
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,440
where we're evaluating the moment

533
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,080
generating function at because that

534
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,039
shows up in the as a double exponential

535
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,279
bound.

536
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:45,559
So what we're going to do to prove this

537
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,559
is we'll use the fact

538
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,480
that 1 + y is at most e to the y. And

539
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,960
this is true for all y.

540
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,039
All right. And so this is a very simple

541
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,679
thing to prove just with calculus or you

542
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,880
can just plot it to check yourself. You

543
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,039
plot uh you know 1 + y and look at e to

544
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,840
the y and you'll see that you know the

545
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,360
line is strict is below um you know the

546
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,960
exponential curve. Um so this inequality

547
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
is going to play a crucial role in

548
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:26,520
getting a convenient form for the right

549
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,520
hand side. So now let's prove this lema.

550
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,400
Well, we're going to prove this just by

551
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,799
direct computation and eventually we're

552
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,559
going to appeal to this fact in order to

553
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,279
write it in a more convenient form.

554
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,799
So, you know what is the moment

555
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,400
generating function of xi? Well, we can

556
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:53,279
write it out because you know there are

557
00:25:48,400 --> 00:26:00,200
only two possibilities. So either

558
00:25:53,279 --> 00:26:00,200
x i equals 1 or x i equals zero.

559
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,120
In the case where it's zero, our

560
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,279
quantity contributes a one, right?

561
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,880
Because we get e to the 0. And the case

562
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,799
where it's a one, we get an e to the b.

563
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,279
So this is just literally using the

564
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,840
definition of the expectation.

565
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,799
And now we can plug in for you know what

566
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,679
the probability of x i being one is. So

567
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:31,360
this gives us on the right hand side p i

568
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:33,600
e e to the b + 1 minus pi.

569
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,240
And we can write this in a slightly more

570
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,400
convenient form. We can write this out

571
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:45,919
instead as 1 + pi * e b minus one. So

572
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,799
I'm just collecting the two terms.

573
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,919
And now I'm almost done because I should

574
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,960
use this fact I told you I needed about

575
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,080
the exponential.

576
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,120
So [clears throat] I'm going to think

577
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,760
about my y variable as just being this

578
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,159
pi quantity on the right hand side. I

579
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,840
have something that looks like 1 + y and

580
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:11,960
I'm going to upper bound it by e to the

581
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,960
y. So using our fact about exponentials

582
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,000
we get that the moment generating

583
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,760
function is now at most e to the pi * e

584
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,679
to the b minus one. Right? So literally

585
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,039
all I'm doing is I'm appealing to the

586
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,880
fact where this is my y right here.

587
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,679
Right? And that's the end of the proof

588
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,080
for limit two.

589
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,640
So right now it's not totally obvious

590
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,120
why we want an expression like this.

591
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,440
Like why did we not just stop at the

592
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,039
expression I had above. Let me give you

593
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,120
a little foreshadowing of where we're

594
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,720
going. See at the end of the day the way

595
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,039
that the churnoff bound works is that

596
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,679
the right hand side has this quantity mu

597
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,399
in it right which is the average of your

598
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,399
random variable. And that quantity mu is

599
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,000
the sum of the pis. So in our lema one,

600
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,480
we're taking the product of all these

601
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
moment generating functions. And so

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,600
what's going to happen is we take the

603
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,559
product of terms that look like this

604
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,919
where the pi is happening upstairs and

605
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,320
then we're going to get a sum of the

606
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,360
pi's and that's where our mu is going to

607
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,200
fall out. So if id kept that other bound

608
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,520
over there, that would have been still

609
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,520
true and just, you know, an even sharper

610
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,520
bound. But it doesn't give me a

611
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,240
convenient expression for actually

612
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,440
getting the churnoff bound that I want.

613
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,640
Okay, so now we can prove the turnoff

614
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,640
bound. Uh,

615
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,600
and I'm just going to prove the upper

616
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,360
tail, but you can check the notes for

617
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,679
the proof of the lower tail, and it

618
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,200
works very similarly.

619
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,039
Um, what I'm going to do is, you know,

620
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,480
at the end of the day, I have to figure

621
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,399
out how to execute this proof strategy,

622
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,279
right? because I have a whole bunch of

623
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,399
parameters that I now need to set. So I

624
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,039
have to set my threshold a you know in

625
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,039
that bound that I wrote up there. I have

626
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,520
to choose my parameter B which is my

627
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,679
helper parameter so that I get a tight

628
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,520
enough right hand side that I get the

629
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,640
upper tail for the turnoff bound popping

630
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,840
out. So let me just tell you what I'm

631
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,760
going to choose for these A's and B. So

632
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,679
A is the obvious thing because it

633
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,840
corresponds to the event we care about.

634
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,679
So it's 1 plus delta time mu because

635
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,360
that's our upper tail condition. And b

636
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,880
we're just going to set to be equal to

637
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,480
the natural log of 1 + delta. So this

638
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,240
might look a little strange, but the way

639
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
that you would prove this yourself or

640
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,640
come up with this B is you would just

641
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,880
work through the calculations I'm about

642
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,880
to do, but keeping B as a free

643
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,279
parameter, you would get a right-hand

644
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,360
side that depends on B and then you

645
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,120
would optimize over what is the best

646
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,440
choice of B that gives you the tightest

647
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,039
upper bound. So all I'm doing here is

648
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm doing the work for you and I'm

649
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,960
telling you that this will be the answer

650
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,640
for B. So let's just work with this B

651
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,360
and then we'll check you know what

652
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,799
happens for the upper tail.

653
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,799
So now we can put this all together.

654
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:19,440
I told you this will be a long proof.

655
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,559
All right.

656
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,559
So let's put this all together.

657
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:39,360
Well, we care about the probability that

658
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,360
X is at least a. And remember, A is 1 +

659
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:47,919
delta * mu. We know that this is the

660
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:52,000
same as the probability that e to the bx

661
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:55,120
is at least e to the a b where a is

662
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,880
again my 1 plus delta mu. Right? This

663
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,600
uses that first fact that these two

664
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:05,039
events are the same. We know by marov

665
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,039
that this is at most the expectation of

666
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,000
e to the bx. That's where we first saw

667
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,039
the moment generating function. Now we

668
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,880
can appeal to lema one

669
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,880
which told us how to write the moment

670
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,880
generating function as the product of

671
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
the moment generating functions of its

672
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,039
constituents. So we get the product from

673
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,919
i= 1 to n of all of these individual

674
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,799
moment generating functions still over

675
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,600
this denominator eab.

676
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:38,000
And finally we can use lema 2

677
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,600
which gave us a good quantitative upper

678
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,279
bound for the setting of the churnoff

679
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:48,559
bound. We get the product from i= 1 to n

680
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:52,399
of e to the p i e e to the b minus1

681
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:54,080
all over e to the ab.

682
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,360
And I'm going to call this right hand

683
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,080
side star. And the name of the game is

684
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,120
really just to figure out what star is

685
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,840
so that the churnoff bound pops out.

686
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,080
So you know our bound star right here we

687
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,840
can plug in for all of our values of a

688
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:17,440
and b we'll get uh the product of i = 1

689
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:21,120
to n of e to the pi

690
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,360
time delta. Right? Because b is natural

691
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,440
log of 1 plus delta. So when I plug this

692
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,679
in, I'm going to get delta sitting out

693
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,720
right here. And then my denominator,

694
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:37,360
well that's e to the ab. So I claim it's

695
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,880
equal to 1 + delta to the 1 + delta time

696
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,279
mu, right? Because again, when I have e

697
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,080
to the ab, I can take the b downstairs

698
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,399
and I'll get 1 plus delta instead of my

699
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,960
e. And that'll be being raised to the

700
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,360
ath power which is exactly this 1 plus

701
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,519
delta * mu.

702
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,440
So you see for the choff bound it's very

703
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,000
easy to potentially get lost in some of

704
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
the computations but the highest level

705
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,399
point is really what's happening over

706
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,640
here the architecture of how the pieces

707
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,600
of the proof fit together. The rest of

708
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,679
it now from now on is just calculus

709
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,360
because all we have to do is figure out

710
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,600
how to actually bound the right hand

711
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,480
side so that the upper tail for the

712
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,480
turnoff pops out.

713
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,840
Okay, so now we have this expression

714
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,880
right here and uh we can write this out.

715
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,480
Of course, the sum of the pis is mu. So

716
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:37,440
we're going to get e to the delta mu all

717
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:40,480
over 1 + delta to the 1 + delta * mu.

718
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,240
And what I claim this will be my lema 3,

719
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,720
the last piece that we need for the

720
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,919
churnoff bound. I claim that this right

721
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,919
hand side is at most whatever shows up

722
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,960
in the upper tail. This e to the minus

723
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,559
delta^ 2 mu type of term. So once I

724
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,799
prove that last lema 3, we'll be done.

725
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,039
Okay.

726
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:09,000
So, let's prove that last part

727
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,000
and it's not too bad.

728
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,919
So, the way that we're going to do this

729
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,079
is like this is what our lema 3 is. We

730
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,159
want to show that this is at most this

731
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,520
quantity right here. So what I'm going

732
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,240
to do is I'm going to take the natural

733
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,240
log of both sides.

734
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:49,280
So the natural log of the left hand side

735
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,800
of my expression is equal to delta mu

736
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,480
minus

737
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,800
1 + delta mu

738
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,480
natural log of 1 + delta

739
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,480
right

740
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,720
and I can rewrite this expression and

741
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:11,680
pull out the mu. So I'll get mu * delta

742
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,520
minus 1 + delta natural log of 1 +

743
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,800
delta.

744
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,960
Nothing fancy is happening here.

745
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,400
And now we need our last you know basic

746
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,720
fact that we're going to take advantage

747
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,839
of which is that I claim for all

748
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,880
x that are strictly positive

749
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,880
we have the following bound.

750
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,480
So the log of 1 + x is lower bounded by

751
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,320
x over 1 + x / 2.

752
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,160
So this is all very natural. I mean I

753
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,240
told you these things follow from the

754
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,960
churnoff bound from you know from

755
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,040
calculus types of proofs. And the idea

756
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,240
is that if I took the tailor expansion

757
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,440
of natural log of 1 plus x my linear

758
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,839
term would be x. And now what I want to

759
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,839
do is I just want to make sure that um

760
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,640
you know the way that I get rid of the

761
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,200
other terms I always have a valid lower

762
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,880
bound. So here what I'm going to do is

763
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,040
um you know you have to choose the right

764
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,560
expression to put in the denominator.

765
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,640
But this is again something you can

766
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,240
check either you know with elementary

767
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,720
calculus or just by plotting these

768
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,640
things to convince yourself it's true.

769
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,560
But now we're in good shape because you

770
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,400
know what this tells us is that uh boy

771
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,560
okay

772
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,520
sorry I'll have to do it over here.

773
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:40,520
So using this fact and our expression

774
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,520
for the left hand side

775
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,640
this is at most mu delta

776
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:52,480
minus mu 1 + delta delta

777
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,320
over 1 + delta / 2.

778
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,720
So you can see what's going on here is

779
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,880
that I'm just plugging in this natural

780
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,280
log of you know 1 + x uh in order to get

781
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,280
rid of this term right here, right?

782
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,800
Because I'm replacing this with delta

783
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,560
over 1 plus delta / 2 and then I'll get

784
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,280
exactly this expression that I've

785
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,520
written down right here. And now when we

786
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,480
collect terms we'll be home free. So

787
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,440
this is equal to mu times a whole bunch

788
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,480
of things. So I'm going to multiply this

789
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,079
part by 1 plus delta / 2 just so that I

790
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,200
can put everything to have this

791
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:34,079
denominator of 1 plus delta / 2 and then

792
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,320
I'll get delta + delta^ 2 - delta minus

793
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,960
delta^ 2

794
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,680
and then life is good because I get

795
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:47,079
minus mu delta^ 2 over 2 + delta and

796
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,079
that's the proof.

797
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,599
So one of the points that I want to make

798
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
so we'll talk more about this in

799
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,200
recitation.

800
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,640
So uh you know the turnoff bound is

801
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,280
definitely one of the most complicated

802
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,880
proofs we've done up until this point

803
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,640
but you know when you're presenting

804
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,119
things that are this complicated or

805
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,599
things like this in your term paper. One

806
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,359
of the things to keep in mind is that um

807
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,839
you know it's not really just begin

808
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,240
proof end proof, right? So the way that

809
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,839
you break up the proof makes it a lot

810
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,800
easier to understand the overall

811
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,119
strategy, right? So for example, the way

812
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,960
that I broke it up into these, you know,

813
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,800
lema 1, lema 2, and then lema 3, it

814
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,960
allows me to give an overview of the

815
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,000
churnoff bound even though it was like a

816
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,520
full lecturer long proof that fits very

817
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,200
compactly.

818
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,200
So a lot of times when you're, you know,

819
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,520
first doing proof-based math, you have

820
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,520
this temptation to prove everything

821
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,960
linearly where you just start at the

822
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,520
beginning and you keep proving things

823
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,760
until you're at the end.

824
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,720
when I was uh you know first starting

825
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,560
out that was also my temptation too. I

826
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,880
think my first paper when I wrote it, it

827
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,440
was like a 15-page begin proof, end

828
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,200
proof and then my adviser told me

829
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,760
afterwards that he didn't understand the

830
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,599
proof which was a little bit worrisome.

831
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,920
In fact, it wasn't even so obvious from

832
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,359
the way I'd written it that uh you know

833
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,359
when you look at the dependencies

834
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,280
between the different pieces that they

835
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,800
were actually asyclic.

836
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,880
So you know to a certain extent

837
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,119
sometimes you can refactor a proof so

838
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,520
that it's not just linear so that you

839
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,400
can give people a preview of how exactly

840
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,040
it fits together right because there's a

841
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,800
difference between you know what are the

842
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,320
parts where the action is happening

843
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,560
where you're telling me about what's the

844
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,720
strategy you're going to use where

845
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,560
you're going to use mutual independence

846
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,480
and the parts which are you know

847
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,720
mechanical and are more technical to

848
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,599
actually execute because a lot of these

849
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,599
things are algebraic computations

850
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,440
I can follow these things and check

851
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,000
them, you know, myself, but the truth is

852
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,720
that I don't learn a whole heck of a lot

853
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,640
from the proof of lema 3, except for the

854
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,560
fact that, you know, if I massage things

855
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,200
algebraically, I'll get the right

856
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,800
expression that I wanted. So you should

857
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,760
think about a lot of these pedagogical

858
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,280
things for you know your own writing

859
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,240
because you know uh are there ways to

860
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,160
you know assert some pieces of the lema

861
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,560
so that you can give people a blueprint

862
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,960
for how the pieces fit together and then

863
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,920
maybe fill in the parts which you know

864
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,839
are the most interesting first and table

865
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,720
the parts which are more mechanical and

866
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,400
algebraic for later. Right? So another

867
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
thing I did to try and present this

868
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,280
proof was that there were things that I

869
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,839
explained that I didn't literally need

870
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,680
to explain. So can you give me any

871
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,839
examples of things in the proof the way

872
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,680
that I presented it that aren't strictly

873
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,240
necessary for getting the upper tail for

874
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,240
the churnoff bound? Just out of

875
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
curiosity.

876
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,599
Most of it's on the board

877
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,079
and also are there any questions about

878
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,079
the turnoff bound proof?

879
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,240
>> Yeah.

880
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,400
>> So at the beginning we said like if you

881
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,359
want to adapt it to a different variable

882
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,720
we could like use bounds on like the

883
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,160
moments. Yeah. Where exactly the proof

884
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,800
like let's say we want to get like a

885
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,960
stricter inequality where would we

886
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,760
incorporate that?

887
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,400
>> Great question. So where in this proof

888
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,800
did I use the fact that the XI's were

889
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,680
Bernoli?

890
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,359
So um now you know like when I have this

891
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,079
architecture the proof just sitting on

892
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,760
the board it becomes a lot easier to

893
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,359
think about you know each individual

894
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
piece right that's the advantage of

895
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,319
presenting it this way. Did I use

896
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,920
Bernoli here?

897
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,720
No.

898
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,319
Did I use Bernoli here?

899
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,640
No. What about here? This was the place

900
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,920
I used it. So that's what I was saying

901
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,760
when I meant that, you know, the

902
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,920
churnout bound can be adapted to many

903
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,599
different settings. It's really just a

904
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,560
blanket statement that sums of

905
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,280
independent random variables, uh, you

906
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,880
know, have nice tailbound properties.

907
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,960
And the only thing that would change was

908
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,280
if you gave me non Berni random

909
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,800
variables I would have other explicit

910
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,760
estimates.

911
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Now here you know I just used Berni to

912
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,400
figure out what exactly the moment

913
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,960
generating function was literally this

914
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,520
is an equality but then I had to do a

915
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,200
bit of massaging to get the pis to be in

916
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,200
the exponent.

917
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,960
So that's the part that would change is

918
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,440
that if you gave me some other random

919
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,960
variables, I could plug in and compute

920
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,280
literally what the moment generating

921
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,800
functions are for them. But then I would

922
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,680
have the same problem about how to

923
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,280
massage that into an expression where

924
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,079
you know when I take the product of all

925
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,760
of them, I get the mu sitting out there.

926
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,000
So those are things which you know you

927
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,000
can be done but for the most part

928
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,160
they're not very instructive. So you can

929
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
just cite whichever churnoff bounds you

930
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,599
want when you have to use it and you

931
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,359
should know that the architecture the

932
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,920
proof is not very surprising right are

933
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,520
there any other questions about it so

934
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,079
the other thing I'll ask which I asked

935
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,240
before right is what part of my

936
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,200
exposition was not literally needed to

937
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,920
prove the turnoff bound yeah

938
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,599
>> moment

939
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,160
>> yeah actually I didn't need to talk

940
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,680
about moment generating functions at all

941
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,160
right

942
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,960
so I could have just said that the right

943
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,440
hand side is the right hand side. It is

944
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,400
whatever it is expectation of e to the

945
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,640
bx and then you know I could have just

946
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,920
said because x is the sum of x i it's

947
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,599
equal to the product of their

948
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,640
expectations and we could have skipped

949
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,680
straight to lema one. That's one way I

950
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,520
could have proved the thing and there

951
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,920
would be nothing mathematically wrong

952
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,760
with that. Right? But this class is, you

953
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,359
know, a CIM. So it's not just about

954
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,240
writing mathematically correct

955
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,240
statements, but it's also about thinking

956
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,400
about, you know, how to do the

957
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,640
exposition to get the audience to better

958
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,839
understand and appreciate it. Why do you

959
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,280
think I talked about the moment

960
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:12,720
generating function even though I didn't

961
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,400
literally need to?

962
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,000
Sorry to put you guys on the spot, but

963
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,240
this is the way I designed it was I want

964
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,520
to interrogate you guys about why I

965
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,200
presented it the way I did

966
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,800
just for fun. Stalling.

967
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,720
>> So it's more modular.

968
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
>> So it's more modular. Yeah, that's one

969
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,720
good thing. Any other ideas why I did it

970
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,800
that way?

971
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,880
Modularity was definitely very important

972
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,560
for being able to fit together a

973
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,560
blueprint of the proof on just one

974
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,839
section of the board. But there's no

975
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,480
there are other reasons I used the

976
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,119
moment generating function. Yeah.

977
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,280
>> To like demystify why.

978
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,680
>> Yeah, that's a big reason, right? So I

979
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,160
used it to demystify because otherwise

980
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,160
this would look like black magic. You

981
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,040
know, we proved the chevbase bound where

982
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,599
we did that same trick of creating a new

983
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,920
random variable and that was very

984
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,599
natural because we had a random variable

985
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,520
before which wasn't non- negative. So we

986
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,920
squared it to create a non-gative random

987
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,520
variable. But you know here, where would

988
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,000
you come up with the idea of taking the

989
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,079
random variable and exponentiating?

990
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,760
That's a very clever idea and it's used

991
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,560
throughout probability. We're not going

992
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,400
to see much more exotic examples, but

993
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,800
otherwise this would seem totally

994
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,040
exotic. Like why wouldn't I try other

995
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
functions? It's really because the

996
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,520
exponential is the thing that keeps

997
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,280
track of all of the relevant information

998
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,000
about the random variable I could care

999
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,480
about. So I not only told you that this

1000
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,040
is called the moment generating function

1001
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,800
but I explained how you could extract

1002
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,200
properties of the random variable from

1003
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,520
that moment generating function. You

1004
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,599
know that way we can talk about what

1005
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,760
properties are we literally using about

1006
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,280
the random variable. There's another

1007
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,280
reason I introduced the moment

1008
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,960
generating function.

1009
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,400
You know I introduced it for several

1010
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,400
reasons. Yeah

1011
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,400
>> maybe.

1012
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,760
Yeah, that's a good thought. But let's

1013
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,800
all that's a good idea, but it also has

1014
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,720
to do with you, the audience,

1015
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,640
right? So, if I were teaching a

1016
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,480
different class, I might not have said

1017
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,440
the things I said about the moment

1018
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,880
generating function. What did I use

1019
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,119
about the moment generating function

1020
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,440
that was specific to you and what else

1021
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,760
you've learned in this class?

1022
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,599
>> We just covered generating functions.

1023
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,839
>> That's right. We just covered generating

1024
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,119
functions. So the way that I chose my

1025
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,960
exposition was also based on what I know

1026
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,839
you know and how to make connections

1027
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,839
between it because uh you know when we

1028
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,920
started the probability unit we then

1029
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,960
switched gears and talked about counting

1030
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,560
and there are a lot of connections

1031
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,400
between probability and counting things

1032
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,880
like you know inclusion exclusion

1033
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,920
formulas. we already saw, you know,

1034
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,079
binomial coefficients coming up. And the

1035
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,599
same way, you know, I wanted to further

1036
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,000
strengthen the connections between

1037
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,839
probability and counting because usually

1038
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,760
they're just, you know, different

1039
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,400
languages for talking about the same

1040
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,920
thing. Okay?

1041
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,920
All right. So, these are all things you

1042
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,720
should think about uh you know, when

1043
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,640
you're doing your own exposition. I'll

1044
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,440
tell you, you know, one last thing and

1045
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,680
then we'll call it a day. Um so the

1046
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,720
churnoff bound is this amazingly

1047
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,839
powerful tool. It was invented by Herman

1048
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,520
Chernoff who was here for a long time.

1049
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,079
Uh it's one of his most famous

1050
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,079
discoveries. But uh you know what's kind

1051
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,000
of funny is he he I mean he actually

1052
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,240
just turned I think a hundred. So he had

1053
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,880
his hundredy year birthday uh recently.

1054
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,359
Um, in fact, another fun fact about him

1055
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
is that his wife is alive, too, and

1056
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,079
they're believed to be the oldest living

1057
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,440
couple in the state of Massachusetts.

1058
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,280
So, that's uh quite something. But uh,

1059
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,160
you know, the churnoff bound also gets

1060
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,880
misused quite a lot, right? Because it

1061
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,200
sounds like this amazing fact that you

1062
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,599
know, when I first introduced it, I

1063
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,000
talked about how we wanted to drive the

1064
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,839
failure probability of some randomized

1065
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,760
algorithm down.

1066
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,359
And if we repeat it a bunch of times,

1067
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,520
things like the weak law of large

1068
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:12,160
numbers would tell us to get our failure

1069
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,079
probability down to like 10 the minus30,

1070
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
we have to repeat it like 10 the 30

1071
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,839
times.

1072
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,839
The churnoff bound would tell us that

1073
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,599
because the right hand side is this

1074
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,839
exponentially small decaying

1075
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
probability, we only have to repeat it,

1076
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,000
you know, natural log of that many

1077
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,559
times. So it tells us that random

1078
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,119
variables concentrate at extremely fast

1079
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,079
rates. But what's really critical about

1080
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,400
it is you know the assumption of mutual

1081
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,240
independence. You know all of this was

1082
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,760
predicated on it. The moment generating

1083
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,400
function keeps track of not just

1084
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,040
pair-wise information but all higher

1085
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,680
order moments. And you know there are a

1086
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,800
lot of famous examples uh that affect

1087
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,319
all of us of people thinking about using

1088
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
the churnoff bound even though it

1089
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,960
doesn't really apply. So, this is

1090
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,720
probably pre your time, but I'll tell

1091
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,319
you uh a story about the financial

1092
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,280
markets, which was certainly relevant

1093
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:09,680
when I was finishing up college.

1094
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,680
Uh so, right around that time, there was

1095
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:17,079
um this big financial crisis

1096
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,079
in 2008.

1097
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,240
And so here, you know, you really have

1098
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,640
to be careful when you try and use this

1099
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,599
reasoning and when you do and don't have

1100
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,160
independence.

1101
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,079
So it's not just important,

1102
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,920
you know, uh I want to say that it's not

1103
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,400
just important to know how to use the

1104
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,200
turnoff bound, but I want to claim that

1105
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:44,599
it's just as important

1106
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,599
to know when tail bounds don't apply.

1107
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,680
So you know uh just a little bit of

1108
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,520
personal background. So both my parents

1109
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,839
are computer scientists. My whole family

1110
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,599
is computer scientists. So I really

1111
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:07,520
didn't want to be a computer scientist.

1112
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,280
Uh I really showed them. Um but uh you

1113
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,920
know I tried out all kinds of things

1114
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,400
when I was at your age. So around that

1115
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,160
time I worked in Wall Street. uh you

1116
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,880
know and I worked on some quantitative

1117
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,960
finance problems and this was pre the

1118
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,240
financial crisis but I remember you know

1119
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,079
one of the things that they were big

1120
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,319
into were very fancy assets so there are

1121
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,240
things called collateralized mortgage

1122
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,760
obligations

1123
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,839
has anyone heard of collateralized

1124
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,839
mortgage operation uh uh CMOs no okay so

1125
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,760
the way that this works is that uh you

1126
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,319
know you have a whole bunch of mortgages

1127
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,240
that you sell to people uh you know for

1128
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,160
them to buy their

1129
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,000
And then implicitly when you're giving

1130
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,000
someone a mortgage, you have to assess

1131
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,680
their creditworthiness

1132
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,480
to figure out the likelihood that

1133
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,400
they're going to pay back the loan. Now,

1134
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,800
for people have great credit ratings,

1135
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,480
maybe that's not such a big risk, but

1136
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,760
you know what happens if you're making

1137
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,760
riskier mortgages, right? So, those are

1138
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,720
things that you can charge more for. You

1139
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,640
can have a higher interest rate. uh but

1140
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,960
you have to deal with the fact that the

1141
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,559
probability that they pay it back might

1142
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,880
be less than you would hope. Right?

1143
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,800
So you had all of these issues in 2008

1144
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,880
that uh there was a huge amount of

1145
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,319
construction going on. People were

1146
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,559
buying a lot of these houses. Some

1147
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,040
people had multiple houses and they had

1148
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,880
very poor credit ratings. But you know

1149
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,800
the banks didn't want to hold on to

1150
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,040
these mortgages because they're risky

1151
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,359
products. So how exactly you know what

1152
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,599
do you do with these financial products?

1153
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:42,880
So there was this great idea which was

1154
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,640
to create synthetic products instead. So

1155
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,480
what you do is you take a whole bunch

1156
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,480
of, you know, what are called subprime

1157
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,480
mortgages

1158
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,440
and you bundle them together

1159
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,440
because the hope is that all of these,

1160
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,599
you know, small probability events of

1161
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,240
the person failing and defaulting on

1162
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,559
their loan, maybe if you combine them

1163
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,960
together, you can appeal to things like

1164
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,040
the turnoff bound and say that, you

1165
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,440
know, things concentrate more around

1166
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,280
their expectation. So you have the issue

1167
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,760
that these subprime mortgages still have

1168
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,520
a reasonably large failure probability.

1169
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,640
So no one would buy them. So what you do

1170
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,200
is you create what's called a waterfall

1171
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,760
payoff structure. So you do something

1172
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,920
called creating tranches. So you have

1173
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,200
this baseline of all of these subprime

1174
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,920
mortgages and then the first people who

1175
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,520
default on their loans. The people who

1176
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,359
are going to eat the losses are the

1177
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,800
people at the bottom of the waterfall.

1178
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,280
That's where the water dries up the

1179
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,319
first. And the people, you know, at the

1180
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,319
very top of the waterfall, they only get

1181
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:49,040
losses if, you know, basically

1182
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,920
everything collapses or a large fraction

1183
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,319
of the mortgages collapse. So maybe each

1184
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,119
mortgage, you know, has a 10% chance of

1185
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,520
defaulting. And in order for this person

1186
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,680
at the very top to eat any losses, maybe

1187
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,520
40% of the mortgages have to default.

1188
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,440
So, you know, if you thought about these

1189
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,640
probabilities as being independent, this

1190
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,400
would be an extremely safe asset, right?

1191
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,559
What's the chance that I take a coin

1192
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,800
that has, you know, is heads with 10%

1193
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:19,839
probability and I flip it a thousand

1194
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,440
times and I end up with 40% heads? It's

1195
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,240
ridiculously small because we just

1196
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,040
proved it with the upper tail, right?

1197
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,960
So, that allowed people to get credit

1198
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,599
rating agencies to say that these are

1199
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,839
very safe assets. So when you have a

1200
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,680
retirement uh plan and you put money

1201
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,400
into your retirement account, there are

1202
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,480
certain rules and regulations about what

1203
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,680
uh the financial risk and the gradation

1204
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,359
for the asset needs to be in order for

1205
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,680
these retirement companies to even

1206
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,280
purchase the asset because these uh

1207
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,760
things that are managing your retirement

1208
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,160
shouldn't be purchasing risky accounts.

1209
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,680
So all the credit rating agencies rated

1210
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:00,559
these things as if the failure of the

1211
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,319
mortgages were independent events. And

1212
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,480
that made them say that actually these

1213
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,960
are extremely safe assets. Maybe they're

1214
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,800
even safer than things like the US

1215
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,040
currency.

1216
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,119
The trouble is that uh churnoff bounds

1217
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,119
don't really apply. So what's the

1218
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,319
problem with this? Why don't tail bounds

1219
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,359
apply? Yeah.

1220
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,440
>> They're not independent.

1221
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,440
>> They're not independent. That's right.

1222
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,839
You know what causes someone to default

1223
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,599
is, you know, a lot of economic strife.

1224
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,040
And when that happens on a massive

1225
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,440
scale, all of a sudden you have this

1226
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,160
domino effect. And these things that

1227
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,359
were you know previously viewed to be as

1228
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,800
very safe things are not really safe

1229
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,559
even though at the time I remember

1230
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,640
people were using things like Gaussian

1231
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,720
approximations to figure out their

1232
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,800
probability of default. So I'll leave

1233
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,480
you with that last nugget which is you

1234
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
know probability is very important for

1235
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,480
your lives. You should use the turnoff

1236
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,559
bounds and the classes we give you in

1237
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,400
problem sets. But in real life, you

1238
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,720
should be critical about, you know,

1239
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,000
whether or not it applies because the

1240
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,160
dependence between these random

1241
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,680
variables is a nasty thing. And there

1242
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,520
are whole courses you can teach on

1243
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,559
dealing with dependent random variables.

1244
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,800
But, you know, to be continued. So, see

1245
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:13,400
you next time. And we'll be starting our

1246
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,400
modular arithmetic unit on Tuesday.
