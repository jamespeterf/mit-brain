1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,480
okay uh this is a talk about one Topic

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,439
in the linear alge book that that people

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
have

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,840
appreciated uh and that's the four

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,160
fundamental

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,080
subspaces so in doing it we'll

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,160
understand better what a Subspace is and

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,840
these four are associated with a matrix

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,640
so we start with a matrix and I want to

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,920
describe its colum space and its row

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,199
space those may be not new to you the

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,640
null spaces of the Matrix and it's

13
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:54,680
transposed that superscript t means that

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,719
the transpose exchanges the rows makes

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,000
them the columns and the columns become

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,920
the rows so that's a trans space so have

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,400
two matrices they each have a column

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,640
space and a row space so four

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,320
fundamental subspaces and then this

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,720
great first fact about linear algebra

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,080
about the row rank equaling the column

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,600
rank so a matrix just has one rank well

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:29,520
let's go just just to say where this

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:32,119
these topics apply the most in a for for

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,320
square Square matrices where you have

26
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:39,960
maybe 12 equations in 12

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,439
unknowns M and N the the the row count

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,159
and the column count are the same those

29
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,600
are normal in physics and Engineering

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,360
you're trying to find the stress on a

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,000
structure or there there you have a

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,399
square Matrix that's usually invertible

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,520
well the four fundamental subspaces are

34
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,479
still there but two of them are empty

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,280
the null spaces I'm thinking this Matrix

36
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,600
is invertible so the null space is only

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,200
the zero vector and same for the

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,800
transpose

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:17,480
so that that solving ax equal B is a

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,440
separate and and fundamental problem

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,120
here are the more

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,440
statistics like regression like leas

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,519
squares and data science now so many

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,360
applications so I thought data science

45
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:37,680
is so big that it would be worth

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,800
focusing again on this case where a is a

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,239
rectangular Matrix the rectangular

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,159
Matrix couldn't have an inverse on both

49
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,480
sides because because on one side you

50
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,519
put m byn m by m and on the other side n

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,440
byn it can't be the

52
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,360
same and but there is something called

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,120
the pseudo inverse that that's a little

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,519
Advanced but you'll see what it's about

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,120
so we're we're in the data science world

56
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,560
oh and I thought I'd show a picture the

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,560
big picture of linear

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,040
algebra before and then you'll see it

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,640
again when you know more about it but

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,640
this is the picture that we're aiming to

61
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,239
understand the the column space is up on

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,159
the top right and the row spaces on the

63
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,959
top

64
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,280
left and again for an invertible Matrix

65
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,799
those that's the whole space that's the

66
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,959
whole space but for for data science

67
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,879
matrices we have null spaces and those

68
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,480
are the

69
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:49,280
two with a capital N for null

70
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,120
space uh and you'll see what those are

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,640
so that they complete the picture this a

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,120
just a lovely picture of the the

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,000
subspaces associated with the Matrix a

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,280
okay so I'll you'll see this again when

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,319
we know when we've gone into each of the

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,360
four so here's the first the column

77
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,519
space of a matrix so I have to take an

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,720
example so there's a matrix that has two

79
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,359
rows and three

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,600
columns and we'll find the four

81
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,199
subspaces for that

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,880
Matrix okay so the first one is the

83
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,039
column space so what does the column

84
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:35,360
space mean if it's all so the columns

85
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,479
are column vectors 14 that's a vector in

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,560
two-dimensional space 25 is a different

87
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,160
Vector 36 is another Vector all in

88
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,400
two-dimensional space and we take their

89
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,800
combinations all

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,160
combinations of V1 time the First Column

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,840
V2 * the second V3 * the 3 that's a

92
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,840
fundamental operation of linear algebra

93
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,280
multiplying a matrix by a vector and

94
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,720
notice that

95
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,120
I don't do it the dot product the

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,840
standard way I do it the linear

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,840
combination way writing this keeping

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,800
keeping vectors in the

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,880
picture combination of of that and we

100
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:24,160
want to find if I allow V1 and V2 and V3

101
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,440
to be any numbers all numbers for all V1

102
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,120
V2

103
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,520
V3 each each choice gives us a point and

104
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,160
the each which is in in two-dimensional

105
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,280
space here because these are vectors or

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
have two

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,400
components and if we take all

108
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,720
combinations all the v's possible that

109
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,960
will fill up a plane and in this

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,280
case there's only the XY all the vectors

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,039
are in the XY plane and those

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,400
combinations will just fill the plane

113
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,600
because 14 is in a independent direction

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,720
from 25 actually just the combinations

115
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,520
of 1 14 and

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,440
25 will fill the plane you've got to see

117
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,919
that you got to picture that in your

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,840
mind the vector 14 points somewhere the

119
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,919
vector 25 points somewhere else and the

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,479
combinations of those two give all the

121
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,720
vectors in between and all the negative

122
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,479
vectors because the v's could be

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,800
negative numbers so the first two

124
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,880
already fill the whole XY plane and so

125
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,960
that's the column space for this Matrix

126
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,560
is the whole plane so that's kind of you

127
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,000
know an extreme case we we got the whole

128
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,720
XY plane and and as it says at the

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,400
bottom the first two columns are already

130
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,360
in different directions they would have

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
their combinations would produce a whole

132
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,960
plane just with the first two and the

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,639
third is a little

134
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,560
extra okay

135
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:08,479
good for the column space so next space

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,599
for this same Matrix is the row space

137
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,479
but I like that letter C and I don't

138
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,639
want to introduce a brand new letter if

139
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:19,479
I don't have to so what I do is

140
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:24,160
transpose The Matrix transpose means the

141
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:26,479
Matrix gets turned on its side and the

142
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,720
14 was the first column and now it's the

143
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,080
first

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,599
row and so now I have a a different

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,400
shape Matrix it has three rows and two

146
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,280
columns and now I'm taking combinations

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,160
of

148
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,280
those and what do I get that here here's

149
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,720
a good example I have two columns two

150
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,120
vectors A1 and A2 and they are in

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,159
threedimensional

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:56,520
space so one vector in three-dimensional

153
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:59,879
space is just along a line and if I took

154
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,960
all the mul If I multiply by anything

155
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,319
I'd get the whole line but it would be

156
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,520
just a line but now I throw in the

157
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:11,240
second column that by itself would give

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,159
me a line in another Direction but when

159
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,400
I take all points on one line plus all

160
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:20,080
points on the other line I fill a I fill

161
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,960
a plane a two-dimensional

162
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,960
plane I nearly said the whole space but

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,319
that's

164
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:33,320
wrong so the the row space here is a

165
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:37,200
two-dimensional space a plane inside

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,320
3D these these all these columns have

167
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,560
three components so they're vectors in

168
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:48,240
threedimensional space so we're in the

169
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,279
the space we live in 3D but the the uh

170
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,640
A1 and

171
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,720
A2 and their combinations fill a plane

172
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,079
in that

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,320
space that that so the this is the

174
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:04,279
second of our four

175
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,399
subspaces and and you you can read below

176
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,560
when I'm taking negative combinations

177
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,279
that gives me the vectors in the

178
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,760
opposite direction they can V1 and V2

179
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,760
can be any

180
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,880
numbers decimals fractions whatever so

181
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,800
here's a picture of this space I like

182
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,120
this picture I think it's got just about

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,920
the right number of vectors to show you

184
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,160
the

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,680
combinations this is only whatever it is

186
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:40,160
25 combinations or something uh no just

187
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,480
20 so we have 20 points but there that's

188
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,440
enough I think to visualize the whole

189
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,760
plane is if if our a if we take a

190
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,839
fraction of those we fill in that inside

191
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,600
but also we take three times them and

192
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,839
four any number times these particular

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,880
vectors and that'll they'll go outside

194
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,560
the

195
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,920
the part I've drawn so I've drawn a part

196
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,320
of the row space of the Matrix

197
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,839
combinations of the rows and I've drawn

198
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,360
drawn in marked out 25 20

199
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:22,880
combinations uh or maybe only

200
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:25,440
16 uh yeah but you know it's enough for

201
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,440
us to imagine what the whole filled in

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,880
plane would look like okay so that's the

203
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,120
other

204
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:38,200
key space the row space now only two

205
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,680
more spaces to go in this example the

206
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,519
null space what does that

207
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,279
mean again it's a space of vectors and

208
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:53,000
in this the null space of the Matrix has

209
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:57,079
all the vectors X that give ax equals z

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,360
that's if you know all those then that

211
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,519
that's a natural bunch of vectors so

212
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,519
here we have to solve ax equals

213
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:11,680
0 so there's you see the a matrix the 1

214
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:16,279
2 3 4 5 six and you see the X vector and

215
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:20,360
you see the com the multiple so I did

216
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,480
multiplication and I've got uh dot

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,240
product there and now I'm setting to

218
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,800
zero do you see any X1 and X2 and X3

219
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:34,279
that work that get the I have two equ

220
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,639
equ both with zero on the right hand

221
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:40,160
side and they have a solution because I

222
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:44,800
have three unknown two equations so

223
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,760
there should be some Freedom here and uh

224
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,320
there the bottom line of this slide

225
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,279
gives the gives the answer uh if I take

226
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,720
one of the First

227
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,160
Column - 2 of the 2 + 1 of the 3 I get

228
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,079
zero

229
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,800
and that means uh I found something in

230
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:10,240
the null space do you see that going

231
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:14,560
back to the Matrix if I add 14 and 36

232
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:19,959
that gives me 410 and that's just twice

233
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:22,120
25 so that line of vectors through 1 - 2

234
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,279
1 is the null

235
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:29,199
space if you've got the null space and

236
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,079
that's what elimination and linear

237
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:35,279
algebra finds this

238
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:38,040
solution uh one more space to go and it

239
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,959
is a little special

240
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,399
because the only contains the zero

241
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:48,760
Vector so again I'm TR this is the null

242
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,680
space of a transpose so I flipped those

243
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,000
rows and made them columns again in a

244
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,720
transpose now I have three equations and

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,120
only two unknowns and there could be

246
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
solution if I had three equations and

247
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,880
two unknowns there could there's always

248
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,760
the zero solution and in this case

249
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,160
that's all there is that's all there is

250
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:17,199
those two columns are in one two three

251
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,760
is a that column is a vector in 3D 456

252
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,399
points another

253
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:25,880
way and and any combination is just

254
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,440
going to have some part of 1 two 3 some

255
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,800
part of 4 five6 the only way to get to

256
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,000
the zero Vector is to have zero of each

257
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:40,360
so the only solution to these three

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,360
equations with two unknowns is zero and

259
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,240
zero so the null space of a transpose in

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,720
this

261
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,320
example was

262
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,279
uh pretty small it's got one vector in

263
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:59,399
it though the zero Vector but that's all

264
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,720
so now we've done the four spaces may I

265
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,279
bring back the picture and you'll see

266
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,839
how they fit again so this is the column

267
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:12,320
space let's review the column space had

268
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,639
two columns in it it didn't need all

269
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,600
three columns of a it just had two two

270
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,839
columns and and their combinations which

271
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,120
picked up the third

272
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:30,320
column so it was Dimension

273
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,959
two this space this Matrix

274
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,079
has R is the letter R stands for the

275
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,519
rank of the Matrix and that's the number

276
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,759
of independent

277
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,800
columns and in this case you remember

278
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,440
there were two the third one wasn't

279
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,880
important and it also this is a

280
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,440
beautiful fact that same R is the number

281
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,880
of independent

282
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,320
rows and you remember this Matrix had

283
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,000
just two rows and they were independent

284
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,160
so rank is two we can find the rank from

285
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,800
the column space or we can find the rank

286
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:12,600
from the row space and the Beautiful bit

287
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,720
of mathematics is that they the the

288
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:22,360
number of vectors you need is the same

289
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,160
and then the null space of a we I think

290
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,839
we

291
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,560
found one vector perpendicular the

292
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,199
rows and uh

293
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,000
the no space of a transpose might have

294
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,519
been zero in that case or vice versa

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,959
anyway we have

296
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:45,079
found all the the pictures all the

297
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:48,160
numbers that go with the example but

298
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:51,959
here you're seeing not an example but

299
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,639
the big picture this is the fundamental

300
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,959
picture of linear algebra in I've

301
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:02,199
learned that in that in reading that

302
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,240
section of my textbook students really

303
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,000
bring things

304
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,000
together

305
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,720
okay so let's see what do I want to say

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,120
next about these four

307
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,759
subspaces apart from recommending that

308
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,160
you take some Matrix yourself and figure

309
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,000
out the four

310
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,519
subspaces so here's the fact that I've

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,920
been talking about the column rank

312
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:31,040
equaling the row Rank and that that's a

313
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,120
beautiful but not obvious fact if if you

314
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,639
had a 50 by 70 M Matrix well just

315
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,000
finding how many independent colums and

316
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,560
how many independent rows would be a

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,360
challenge but the numbers would be the

318
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,319
same the number of independent columns

319
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,880
equals the number of independent rows

320
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:53,319
that's just linear algebra magic and

321
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,920
that number we call R so that sort of

322
00:16:53,319 --> 00:17:03,440
measures the real size of the Matrix and

323
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:09,240
uh I every uh textbook has to prove that

324
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:12,439
and I like to build it out of this uh

325
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,880
factorization for me factorizations are

326
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:20,240
fundamental to linear algebra for for

327
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:24,039
everybody really and uh so I can I I'll

328
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,880
come back in a on another day maybe to

329
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:29,600
talk about that factorization but the

330
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,559
rank is two here your here our friendly

331
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:38,160
Matrix a and it we divided it into we

332
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,679
took the independent columns 14 and 25

333
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,200
as the C Matrix and then the r Matrix we

334
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,720
just filled in to get the right

335
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,559
answer

336
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,280
and the two was the number of

337
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:56,039
independent columns and two is the

338
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:00,200
number of independent rows so this this

339
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:03,840
AAL CR gives a beautiful proof of

340
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,320
that Dimension theorem dimension of row

341
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,520
space equal dimension of column space so

342
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,520
that's just a nice part of the

343
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,190
theory okay

344
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,039
now now

345
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,240
[Music]

346
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,360
we going to use the what we just the

347
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,280
four

348
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,159
subspaces it's everybody now knows the

349
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,159
row space and the column space have the

350
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:34,280
same Dimension r and if I take something

351
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:37,240
in the row space multiply by a it's in

352
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,080
the column space of course everything

353
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,039
when I multiply by a is in the column

354
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,159
fills the column space

355
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,960
and the for that part of the problem

356
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:54,840
from row space to column space from uh

357
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,720
space of of Dimension R to a space of

358
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,280
Dimension

359
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:04,080
R The Matrix is in in verble every and

360
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,159
and I give a proof that you don't need

361
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,000
but but that's a sign of an invertible

362
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:15,000
Matrix when every every uh Vector goes

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,840
all vectors go to all different vectors

364
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,760
here go to different vectors

365
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,799
here and that's from row space to column

366
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,720
space that's that's a key that's that's

367
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:31,400
the heart of the Matrix is the part that

368
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,039
that goes that actually does something

369
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,760
nonzero that takes the row space to the

370
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:41,480
column space and

371
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,000
then you can think about the Matrix that

372
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,000
brings it back just undoes this and

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,640
that's called the pseudo

374
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,799
inverse and its symbol is a with a plus

375
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,600
sign or a

376
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:59,440
dagger so that's a kind of new

377
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:03,960
newish le less less familiar idea

378
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:07,120
that because the Matrix a between row

379
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,000
space and column space the null space is

380
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,679
not in the picture for this slide just

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,400
between rows row space and column

382
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,799
space that that's a perfect match those

383
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,039
two spaces so there's

384
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,640
a m Matrix that brings me backwards an

385
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:29,640
inverse Matrix but it's called the

386
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,280
pseudo inverse because

387
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,799
I'm ignoring any null

388
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,320
spaces so it doesn't it's not a true

389
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,200
inverse because

390
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,679
you're a true inverse shouldn't have a

391
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,400
null space

392
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:50,000
there okay now application so I've

393
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,720
discussed the four subspaces and I

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,039
suggest you figure out what they might

395
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:01,080
be for some other Matrix but now I want

396
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:03,360
to use that idea in a the most

397
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,799
important type of

398
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:11,320
application for statistics it even has

399
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,799
two names statistics people call it

400
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:19,120
regression and linear algebra people

401
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:22,400
call it leas squares and uh that's the

402
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,720
problem there make find the vector X

403
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:30,360
that makes axus b as short as possible

404
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,600
minimizes the length if there's a

405
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,919
solution to ax equal B then we take that

406
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:42,240
X and we get ax - B would be

407
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:46,200
zero but when we have null spaces and

408
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:50,960
things around uh we may not be able to

409
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:54,600
get ax equal B but what we can get and

410
00:21:50,960 --> 00:22:00,279
do get is

411
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:03,720
that equation a transpose time a * x = a

412
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:06,559
transpose time B in other words you

413
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,600
could see actually by Calculus if you

414
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,400
took the derivative of ax minus b^ 2

415
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,120
because you always take derivatives if

416
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,679
you're minimizing something and set them

417
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,919
to zero it would lead to that

418
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:26,360
equation that square makes it brings in

419
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:29,520
an a transpose and and that's the

420
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:34,279
equation you get so that's the equation

421
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,559
that LE squares problems have to solve

422
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:40,960
yeah yeah that and that

423
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,840
it's it's uh one of the fundamental

424
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,080
equations of linear

425
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:52,480
algebra okay and and uh so what what I'm

426
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,919
saying down here is there's one X hat

427
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,159
now I'm calling the solution here x hat

428
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:04,120
uh because it uh I'm not solving ax

429
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:07,080
equal B I'm solving this easier I made

430
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,640
more solutions or created some solutions

431
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:14,159
when I multiply both sides by a

432
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,080
transpose so the solutions Solutions now

433
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,840
are called X hat and there's one

434
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,720
solution in the null space there's one

435
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,799
solution X hat in the row

436
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,120
space because the row space and column

437
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:34,120
we have th this is R equations in our

438
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:38,480
unknowns and it's got a got a unique

439
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:42,960
solution X hat that that X hat is the

440
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,480
goal that's the answer to the regression

441
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,080
problem the least squares problem X

442
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,440
hat

443
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,679
solves makes ax minus b as small as we

444
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,279
can make

445
00:23:52,679 --> 00:24:00,279
it that's that's the least squares

446
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:04,919
problem least squares small

447
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:08,279
square and uh so that's the one we're

448
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:12,360
after okay uh just to finish up on the

449
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:15,120
pseudo inverse which is a cool idea let

450
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,480
me come back to the main slide of the

451
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,320
whole talk the four subspaces and ask

452
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,399
what the the pseudo inverse does you

453
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,640
remember what the Matrix a does it takes

454
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:32,559
a vector in the row space multiply by a

455
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,120
you get something in the column space

456
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,520
something in the null space you multiply

457
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,760
by a and you get zero now we want to go

458
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,080
backwards so the beauty is that this

459
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,399
part which is what we want to just

460
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,840
reverse is uh uh those have the same

461
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:55,600
Dimension so we're fundamentally looking

462
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,640
at a square Matrix which has an inverse

463
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,960
when we're up top so that's what the

464
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,279
pseudo in

465
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,120
is it takes the the Y back to

466
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:09,919
X and what does it do to these sends

467
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,399
them to zero just the way a transpose

468
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,320
does so you the pseudo inverse gives the

469
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:19,640
correct inverse up here where the real

470
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,159
action is and down here where matri

471
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,799
where vectors are sent to zero can't

472
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:30,320
bring them back from zero they're de but

473
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:33,559
so every Vector here goes goes to zero

474
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,000
so that's the pseudo inverse it has the

475
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:40,480
has all the the four sub spaces are just

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:45,080
reversed right to left and uh it's a

477
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,640
useful idea not the most basic idea it

478
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,480
doesn't show up in all courses but when

479
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,200
we had the four subspaces here it was so

480
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,919
easy to tell you what the sudo inverse

481
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,679
is so it just takes just so neat with

482
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,399
this figure ites takes each Vector in

483
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,279
the column space back to the vector in

484
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,960
the row space where it came from so

485
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,360
that's a plus the pseudo

486
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:14,039
inverse okay thank you that's the four

487
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,399
subspaces of any Matrix and you'll

488
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,480
remember that if the Matrix is

489
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:22,320
invertible uh square and invertible

490
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,080
these two spaces are gone and we simply

491
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,440
have uh the row space and the column

492
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:33,760
space are both the full space and we

493
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,360
have a perfect onetoone exchange then

494
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,240
luckily a lot of matrices are invertible

495
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:43,559
but this covers the case of matrices

496
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,640
invertible or not square or not every

497
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:50,840
Matrix has got those four fundamental

498
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,840
subspaces thank you
