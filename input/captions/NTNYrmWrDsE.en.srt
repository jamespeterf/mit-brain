1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,920
All right. Thank you all uh for coming

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,919
here and listening to these exciting set

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,719
of talks. I've been like super enthused

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,040
since morning. Um and thank you Dmitri

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,719
for setting the stage for organ

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,920
transplantation. And um this talk is

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,720
about some new types of organs that are

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,199
being discovered at this very moment in

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
the last couple of years. And uh so I'm

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
going to talk about the impact of

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,960
cryopreservation and xenographed organs

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,279
on the already complex organ

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,920
transplantation pipeline. And I want to

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,640
say a huge thank to the circ seed grants

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,399
for helping us jumpst start this

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,719
collaboration. Our uh team here has some

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
fantastic students Thomas and Meline.

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,040
Meline is actually in the crowd there.

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,000
And we have master students uh Jesse and

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,039
Praik. And our collaborators uh Dr.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,440
called IEN uh Heidi Mahmed Toner and

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,800
David Cron have actually been involved

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,840
in successfully transplanting a first uh

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,440
pig edited gene organ uh into a human

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,799
and they're actually looking at clinical

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,400
trials uh uh starting in 2025 uh for

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,600
this technology. They've also

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,920
successfully shown uh

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,040
cryopreservation uh for um uh pig and

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,759
human kidney partial freezing. So in

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,880
that context uh let me give you some

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,360
numbers again. So each day 18 Americans

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,759
die waiting for an organ transplant.

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,240
Thousands never make it to a transplant

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,479
list. Out of these endstage organ

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,040
failure alone accounts for around 7

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,240
30,000 deaths in the US and it's

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
estimated that 30% of these can be saved

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,960
with an organ replacement. So with these

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,920
staggering numbers when we preview these

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,640
exciting technologies uh that are about

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,280
to uh you know that are already starting

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,000
and uh rapidly rising in growth of

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,479
cryopreservation and xenor grafting we

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,640
have an opportunity. So with these

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,719
breakthroughs the opportunity is that

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
you know we can we have a chance to

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,520
reshape the organ transplantation the

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,840
future of organ transplantation. But the

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,840
question isn't just can we do that, it's

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,560
where and how should we target these new

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
technologies uh to have a positive

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
impact on the existing organ

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,720
transplantation pipeline. How should we

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,680
assess that? Because look, these

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,520
technologies are currently being uh uh

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
passed through clinical trials. So

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
there's not enough data. So we have to

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
rely on the data that already exists in

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
the current system with the current

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
practices and find opportunities where

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,959
these should be uh these should enter

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
the market in some sense right so as

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
Dimmitri already mentioned organ

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,680
transplantation is actually a very

66
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599
complex process it's uh beyond the organ

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,160
transplantation policies there are

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,800
various factors on what is the kidney

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,120
quality so these are donor factors what

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
are the recipient factors things like

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,040
HLA compatibility things like

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,760
sensitization, things like you know what

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,519
is the age of the recipient and how how

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,400
sick and how urgently they need that

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,400
organ. There are human factors on you

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
know what is the surgeon's estimate of

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,640
the benefit and the risk of doing an

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,280
organ transplantation with a particular

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,519
kidney that becomes available. There are

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,480
uh logistics and timing which include

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,879
geographic distance, the time to offer

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,360
acceptance which might already uh you

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
know deem that organ unviable but

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
perhaps we could save that using

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,319
cryopreservation. Cryopreservation is

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,400
this uh you know you freeze an organ to

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,959
very low temperatures so that you can

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
extend its viability not just for 24

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,319
hours but for days and that creates

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,280
massive opportunity because you could

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,480
preserve high uh even mediocre quality

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,000
organs and make them available across uh

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,519
the US and across uh the world even. And

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
there are institutional and policy

95
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
factors that not just impact that not

96
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,040
just come from national policies but

97
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,519
there might be local and regional

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,120
policies that impact organ offer

99
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,360
acceptance, right? And so what we want

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,760
to do is we want to look at all of this

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,879
data that already exists and we want to

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,519
use AI to help us understand where are

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,159
the gaps in supply and demand, where are

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,919
the opportunities for xeno and cryo uh

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:21,359
organs. But this is a hugely complex uh

106
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,919
medical uh decision-m space and what we

107
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,800
would like is for that AI to know also

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,199
where it is uncertain. We don't want a

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
system that can only predict and

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,160
prescribe but we want a system that is

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,880
very transparent about its errors.

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,800
Right? So our goal is not to automate

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,360
the process. It is the augmentation of

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,360
decision- making using prescriptive AI

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
which is transparent about the errors

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
that it makes.

117
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
And that is a a big open question.

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
There's a lot of research that's

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,040
currently happening in trying to

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
calibrate AI models and think about what

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,479
are the errors in different instance

122
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
spaces that they make. And so we are

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,240
going to try and bring that thought

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,400
process into the space of organ

125
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,720
transplantation. So our first question

126
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:11,039
is when uh is xenographing most useful?

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,680
So which types of organs are more in

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,000
demand but there's not enough supply and

129
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,039
if we could actually create these tailor

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
gene edited pig organs if we could all

131
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,919
if we could target specific profiles

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
then could we actually close that supply

133
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,919
demand gap could we actually provide

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,800
better kidneys uh to patients who really

135
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,759
need them and so uh here is a

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,000
perspective from a patient's uh uh you

137
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
know from a patient's perspective what

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
happens when they're made kidney offers

139
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,560
or what might they expect in an organ

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,560
transplantation pipeline. So here is a

141
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,720
patient or you can think of it as a pool

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
of patients that are looking for an

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,800
organ that is a good fit to them. In the

144
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,720
uh pipeline there'll be many organs that

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,400
will be offered to patients with similar

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,120
profiles. These organs can have a higher

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,639
quality and they can have lower quality.

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
And so this is measured by something

149
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,360
that is called the KDPI which measure

150
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
measures is a measure of uh organ

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,560
quality for kidneys how useful how how

152
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,960
beneficial these kidneys are going to

153
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,360
be. And once a patient is offered all of

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,039
this portfolio of organs over a period

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
of time and I'm thinking about a patient

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,400
cohort but simplifying on this slide. If

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,160
I typically match patients of this sort

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,639
with an organ of a high quality relative

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,479
to the offers that they've gotten, I

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
say, well, there's enough supply of such

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,800
organs, you know, accounting for time

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
effects, for weight list effects, for

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,560
placement effects and so on. There's

164
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,560
enough supply of good organs and they

165
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,440
can be matched to an organ with

166
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,919
relatively high KDPI. But on the other

167
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,520
hand, we see cases where there are

168
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,440
patient groups that are despite an organ

169
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,919
the distribution of organs or the types

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,120
of organs that are offered to them have

171
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,319
higher KDPIs, they often end up getting

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,720
lower uh uh quality kidneys. So they end

173
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
up getting not the high quality kidneys

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,039
that would have appeared in an offer to

175
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,599
them in the system but they end up

176
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,120
getting lowquality kidneys. And so for

177
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,360
various reasons um we call that a supply

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,440
demand gap. So we say that you know if

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,759
something like this happens that's an

180
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
opportunity for xenor grafted organs

181
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,080
because I've identified a patient

182
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,880
population that for various reasons in

183
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,840
this complex pipeline are actually not

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,360
making use of the or high quality organs

185
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,599
that are get uh getting offered to

186
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,400
them. And so our question here is that

187
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,280
let's look at all of the ptr data. So we

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,360
have uh this is the matchr run algorithm

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,199
which makes offers to patients uh

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
through policies that uh Dimmitri

191
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,000
discussed in his talk and so we have

192
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,560
around 25 million records here and we

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,400
want to use AI to automatically find

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,919
sets of patients with various recipient

195
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,560
characteristics where then they do don't

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:07,680
have access to high quality kidneys in

197
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,160
that system. Right? Okay. So we can uh

198
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,160
uh create metrics. These are uh

199
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,479
statistical metrics. They are just a

200
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,039
single number that we evaluate for every

201
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,080
patient and we evaluate it for a cohort

202
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,960
of patients. And we can create these uh

203
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,879
models that tell us where the nodes are

204
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,440
redder in color, that's where there's

205
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,759
excess supply. Where the nodes are

206
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,680
lighter in color, that's where we are

207
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,159
kind of closing that supply demand gap.

208
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,640
If the nodes are white, that's where the

209
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,120
demand is much higher than the supply,

210
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,880
right? And so let's let's unpack that a

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
little bit. So this is in one of the

212
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,959
regions. So in this talk, I'm going to

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,040
consider three regions. There are three

214
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,240
um big cities with a lot of

215
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,200
transplantation centers. They're uh

216
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
demographically very diverse and so but

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,880
uh uh we are going to offiscate the

218
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
names but just call these regions one,

219
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,399
two, and three. In region one, we see

220
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
this node with a very red color. Which

221
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,360
means that if I look into that node, the

222
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
patients are have been offered kidneys

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
of quality that look like that. So

224
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,320
that's worse kidney quality. These are

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,480
the offers, the blue histogram. And the

226
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
acceptances are skewed towards the

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,920
right. Uh which means that this is

228
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,839
higher uh relatively higher uh uh

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,240
quality kidneys were accepted more

230
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,320
frequently than the lowquality kidneys.

231
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
And so that tells me there is no supply

232
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
demand gap. In fact, supply is enough

233
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,920
and there is uh enough uh there is not

234
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,440
uh demand that we cannot meet with the

235
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,519
current availability of organs in the

236
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,640
system. Let me show you another example.

237
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,680
This is a supply demand gap in region

238
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,320
two. And here we see a node which has a

239
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,959
negative value. And what that negative

240
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,680
value means mathematically is that there

241
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,720
is more demand than potential supply.

242
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,040
when I unpack the offers that patients

243
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
with these characteristics have gotten.

244
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,440
So these patients are the ones that are

245
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,760
not blood typo and where a particular

246
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,399
alil B162 is present. For these patients

247
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,160
the mean quality of kidney that was

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,880
offered to them is better than what was

249
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,760
uh actually accepted. And so the offers

250
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,600
tend to be uh towards lower kidney

251
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,560
quality rather than higher kidney

252
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,800
quality as in the previous example. So

253
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,040
this automatically helps us uh this

254
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,240
system automatically helps us go through

255
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,880
millions of patient uh uh uh organ

256
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,200
offers and automatically detect areas

257
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,040
where xenor grafting can be very useful.

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,399
Next up, I want to think about

259
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,519
cryopreservation. And cryopreservation,

260
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,480
as I said, is this uh uh scientific

261
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
technology of kind of uh uh decreasing

262
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,959
the temperatures and freezing the organs

263
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,640
to such a low amount that you can

264
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
preserve the organ for a much longer

265
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,200
time beyond 24 hours of kidney

266
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,800
viability, but also you can do it in a

267
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
way you can slowly increase the

268
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
temperature in a way that the organ

269
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,440
still remains viable. And uh our

270
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
question is that you know there is a lot

271
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,480
of kidneys lot of organs that are

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
actually unused in the system. They're

273
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,360
non-utilized and can we actually utilize

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,480
them potentially by

275
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,480
cryopreservation. So some statistics

276
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,959
again. So here we are looking at disease

277
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,320
donor organs in this space and the

278
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,519
kidney non-use in 2023 and this is a

279
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,959
slide from SRTR uh shows that there were

280
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,440
5,000 donors with at from whom at least

281
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,000
one of the kidney was not used. There

282
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,480
are approximately there were 85,000

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
8,500 kidneys that were non-used from

284
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,160
these 5,000 donors and there were 26

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,959
million offers that were made for these

286
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,279
kidneys that were ultimately not used.

287
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,120
So imagine an organ becomes available,

288
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,360
it is getting matched and offered to

289
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,920
patients by their uh priority on the

290
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,160
weight list. By the time somebody could

291
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,880
even accept that offer, that kidney is

292
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,639
already not viable anymore. Right? And

293
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,639
so there is a lot of uh uh you know it's

294
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,279
over 28% of the kidneys recovered from

295
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,160
disease donors were actually not used in

296
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:22,720
2023 and that's a huge uh uh opportunity

297
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,800
to use cryopreservation. It's also a

298
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
huge opportunity to automatically

299
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,800
understand if a kidney is not likely to

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,920
be used by the first 500 patients, why

301
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,040
not bypass and create an expedited offer

302
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,720
that can place that kidney faster and

303
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,920
potentially somebody can benefit from

304
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,720
it. So with that in mind, we thought

305
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,320
about you know what are the uh what are

306
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
the organs that are viable for

307
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,120
cryopreservation. There are definitely

308
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,519
factors that uh you know correspond to

309
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,480
high creatinin levels, low filtration

310
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,040
rates, uh old kidneys from very old

311
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,680
donors that make them not very viable

312
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,360
for use. But what about kidneys that are

313
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,440
kind of in that mediocre range that

314
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,279
could still be useful if they were just

315
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
transplanted early enough or

316
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,320
cryopreserved and transplanted later in

317
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,519
the system. So that's our next question

318
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,240
that we considered on how can we use AI

319
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,480
to predict how different regions in the

320
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
US so we've just done it for three

321
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,399
regions so far how different regions in

322
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,120
the US will respond to an offered

323
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,399
non-utilized organ in the system by

324
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,079
learning from past

325
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,200
decisions. So we are taking the current

326
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,639
system the current organ transplantation

327
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,800
pipeline which does not have an estimate

328
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,720
of the risk. It does not uh have

329
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
cryopreserved organs in the pipeline but

330
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
we are trying to learn from that data

331
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,440
and again we're going to keep our eye

332
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,880
towards uh uncertainties in that

333
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,320
pipeline and errors in these

334
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,880
predictions. So we took all of this data

335
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,639
uh we went very happily uh you know we

336
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,399
developed our machine learning models we

337
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,040
did some feature selection we got input

338
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,760
from doctors uh because of the policy

339
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,040
changes we incorporated years we had low

340
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,600
and high KDPI kind of variables uh we

341
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,720
had uh you know regional models that

342
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,880
predicted uh what is the maximum uh you

343
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,880
know predicted acceptance of organs

344
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,199
across the three regions and there these

345
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,160
models are different reflecting regional

346
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,560
practices

347
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,040
And then using all of this, we wanted to

348
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,360
predict accept or reject. But of course,

349
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,000
this is a system that's using all of

350
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,959
this data that exists and the system can

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,519
make mistakes. So let's look at the

352
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,360
accuracy of this. The accuracy that we

353
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,800
got was fantastic. We were very happy

354
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,440
when we saw that, right? But an accuracy

355
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,839
of 98% 99% from accepted from uh the PTR

356
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,480
match run data has to be taken with a

357
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,320
pinch of salt. Why? Because most of

358
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
these organs are actually rejected. Most

359
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,040
of these offers in the system are

360
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,680
rejects, right? So even if I predicted a

361
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,839
reject for every organ, I would get an

362
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,600
accuracy of

363
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:08,160
98%. So accuracy has to be taken with a

364
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,560
pinch of salt and instead we can look at

365
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,079
precision accept. What is precision

366
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,760
accept saying for offers that were

367
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,320
actually uh labeled as accept? How many

368
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,320
were actually accepted in the data? So

369
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
for organs where I actually predicted

370
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,880
and accept how many of these were

371
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,519
actually accepted by the doctors that's

372
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,560
when a system can be really useful right

373
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,839
and so across these three areas we

374
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,639
actually saw that region one had a 65

375
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,800
precision accept region two had 94 which

376
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,120
is fantastic and region three had 85%.

377
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,240
All right. So, we thought to ourselves,

378
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,800
you know, is our uh AI making mistakes

379
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,800
or uh is the data bad or is the

380
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,120
decisions of the doctors very noisy?

381
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,759
Like what is going on here? Why don't we

382
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,480
have the same precision accept across?

383
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,440
And a little bit of insight into that is

384
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,160
that indeed region one has much sparer

385
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,360
data than region two. So there is that

386
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,199
effect of not having enough data across.

387
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,920
And we trained national models and they

388
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,800
didn't help us. So we said you know can

389
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,839
we create can we understand what are

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,160
these regions based on organ quality

391
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,320
where I will have more fidelity in my

392
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,160
prediction versus where I know that my

393
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,560
prediction is uncertain and I should not

394
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,800
make a decision. And so in that uh uh in

395
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,880
that vein so with that thought process

396
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,519
we looked at what is the performance of

397
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,279
these models across the three different

398
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,839
regions. And as you can see the

399
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,720
performance is not uniform. So as the

400
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,360
kidney quality changes for very low

401
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,000
kidney quality. So that's very uh that's

402
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,839
the end of the bar chart here. Uh a lot

403
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,959
of kidneys are rejected and so the

404
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,199
decisions are much easier for very high

405
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,360
quality kidneys. A lot of kidneys are

406
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,440
accepted and decisions are easier. But

407
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,000
you will see a dip when the decisions

408
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,160
kind of become in that gray zone. Right?

409
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,799
And so our thought process here and let

410
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,880
me skip through these slides was that

411
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,799
you know we want to be able to navigate

412
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,199
these predictions with the amount of

413
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,120
uncertainty in my AI model. And here is

414
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,319
the kind of tradeoff that we would like

415
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,160
to make visible uh to our team uh and

416
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,280
and and to the uh transplantation

417
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,679
system. So in region one the expected

418
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,640
number of placements for the set of

419
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,200
kidneys between 0.5 and 6 kdpi. So this

420
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,200
is mediocre range was around 23 to

421
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,679
57%. That's kind of our our range of how

422
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,600
uncert uncertain we think the model is

423
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,280
and the precision accept of that model

424
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,320
is 43. So every time I'm giving you in

425
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,440
some sense a range of what I think the

426
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,679
benefit can be from placing this organ

427
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,360
into region one, region two or region

428
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,320
three. And I'm also combining that with

429
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,280
the precision accept across uh for these

430
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,799
kinds of organs. So this is a simplified

431
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,360
slide to tell you that there is a

432
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,720
trade-off, right? I can go with a very

433
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,679
certain model in region three that has

434
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,640
that almost saves no kidneys or I can go

435
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,840
with a model in region one that is uh

436
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,960
much less certainty and saves uh organs

437
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,400
amongst in that range. And so one might

438
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,240
think that you know if I want to have a

439
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,320
trade-off I might go with a more a

440
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,919
region two which has a 0 65 precision

441
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,559
accept. So with all of this we are very

442
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,039
excited to understand the trade-offs

443
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,200
develop more machine learning models uh

444
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,760
kind of open up that back uh that black

445
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,480
box for uh physicians and decision

446
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,960
makers in the system and uh we are

447
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,400
developing currently web tools to bridge

448
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,799
this to practice. So for any organ that

449
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,600
becomes available in the system, we have

450
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,960
a web tool that's not online yet but

451
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,799
will be very soon. Um where you can ask

452
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,039
for the predictive models for different

453
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,080
transplantation centers in the regions

454
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,640
that we've considered for the organ. We

455
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,360
can show you that you know this organ

456
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
looks like uh very similar to all of

457
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,840
these organs that were actually

458
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,520
rejected. you can explore what organs in

459
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,000
the systems which past offers were

460
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,240
rejected which were similar to these or

461
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,760
if there is a possibility of placing

462
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,080
that organ in that uh center. So that

463
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,919
will help us create these expedited

464
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,400
offers that can help with the use of

465
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,480
cryopreservation decrease

466
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,039
non-utilization of kidneys. So with that

467
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,840
um thank you all for listening and I'm

468
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,840
very happy to take questions.

469
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
questions.

470
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,919
Are you using the region's data to train

471
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,440
the regions model? We are. Yes. Or

472
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,600
you're not cross you're not using it

473
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,120
across the three regions. We tried

474
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,200
training a model across the three

475
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,520
regions and fine-tuning for the regions

476
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,679
data and that ended up uh not having a

477
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,360
higher predictive power as we can see on

478
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,240
the test data for the regional models

479
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,039
themselves. Sometimes we also find that

480
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,799
the variables that are being selected so

481
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,280
we have a staggering number of 800

482
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,840
variables that go into uh prediction for

483
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,280
every offer and uh the variables that

484
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,720
are selected that are most predictive

485
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,720
are often different for the different

486
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
regions. So some of the key variables

487
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,039
are the same but uh you know you see

488
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,919
insurance pop up in one of the regions

489
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
and so that's uh you know that's a

490
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
potential you know there's some

491
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,760
correlation there that we would like to

492
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,559
explore.

493
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,559
Great further

494
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,039
questions. Thank you so much for this

495
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,760
presentation. I have some questions

496
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,480
about the AI techniques you use. So you

497
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,640
use XG boost. Did you also consider

498
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,960
using like transformers or CNN or any

499
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,080
other models? If so, what were the

500
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,159
difficulties when trying? Right. So uh

501
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:24,000
we used um LLMs.

502
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:27,440
So uh we uh actually uh we followed up

503
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,080
on a very nice uh recent work from

504
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,799
Dimitri's group actually on tap tech

505
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,120
creates uh which takes a tabular data

506
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
creates that into text data creates an

507
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,760
embedding from that and augments the XG

508
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,159
boost model and we found that you know

509
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,240
for some regions it had a slight benefit

510
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,559
but for others we've not seen the

511
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,280
benefit yet so there's more exploration

512
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,280
to be done there. Yeah.

513
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,480
But perhaps some of these uh uh uh you

514
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,440
know uh transformer augmented models

515
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,120
could help create more context. But I

516
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,760
think what what we are seeing is that

517
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,120
there's enough noise in the system that

518
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,400
you know you're kind of reaching the

519
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,400
limits of what can be predicted here.

520
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:19,880
Awesome. Any further questions for

521
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Swy? Yes.

522
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,360
Hi. Um, is it possible that the machine

523
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,280
learning actually is learning the wrong

524
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,039
things and emphasizing the wrong things

525
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,120
continually?

526
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,440
So, we we are trying to make sure that

527
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,679
that doesn't happen. So, using all of

528
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,000
our various analysis. So we've done like

529
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,280
SHAP analysis. We've tried to understand

530
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
you know what are the different factors

531
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,360
that go into that decision-m we've

532
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,320
talked to the doctors. We've kind of you

533
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,480
know it's it's that uh we've kind of

534
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,520
tried to check at every step with the

535
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,240
domain experts in this area to see if

536
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,880
things are uh aligned with you know what

537
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,400
they would

538
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,720
expect. So and and sometimes we've been

539
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,840
able to see uh examples. And so for

540
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,200
example, we have a model that predicts

541
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,720
non-utilization in the current system.

542
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,679
Uh is this organ going to be

543
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,919
non-utilized or not? And we do see when

544
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,320
we predict non-utilization, we see areas

545
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,120
of high creatinin and high age donors

546
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,640
that pop up as very certain non-utilized

547
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,880
in the system. Right? So every time we

548
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,360
train a model, we try to back up and

549
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
then stress test that on okay, what are

550
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,200
the distributions? Where are the errors?

551
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
What is it saying? Is it saying

552
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,559
something that we believe is true or

553
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,039
not? And this uh space is very complex.

554
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,720
So I I feel like we're peeling an onion.

555
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,360
Every time you peel a layer, that's

556
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,400
there's another layer to peel. Great.

557
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,200
And final question. Um how are you

558
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,559
planning to prevent model drifts in the

559
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,679
future?

560
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,000
So uh one way that uh we are kind of

561
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,159
thinking about this is incorporating

562
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,240
year and kind of time trends uh in the

563
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,840
model specifically with respect to

564
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,880
policy changes. You know, as policy

565
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,280
changes, there is a a lot of change in

566
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,320
the system. And so, you have to in some

567
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,559
sense stay current, but also incorporate

568
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,000
like some of the resistance. Like in one

569
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,919
of the analysis we did, we thought uh we

570
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,159
found some evidence that you know

571
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,640
centers that have that have that are

572
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,360
more reputed and that you know they they

573
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,440
just have a higher friction in kind of

574
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,600
changing their policy across the years.

575
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,919
So they change the policies much slower

576
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,919
and centers that are much smaller they

577
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,520
are more actively changing the policies.

578
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,120
So there's there's a lot to be done in

579
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,600
that space and I I think we are only

580
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,600
scratching the surface.

581
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,200
Thank you so much.
