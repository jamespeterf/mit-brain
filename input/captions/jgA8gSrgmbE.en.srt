1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
U thank you everyone. My name is Narin

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,240
Talbergata. I'm the CEO and co-founder

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,720
of Tessle Biosciences. I'm an MIT

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,040
undergrad alum. Uh course 6 class of

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,799
2013. Uh went on to get a PhD in biology

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,960
uh from Harvard working on organoid

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,359
cultures which is a big part of our uh

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,520
of our approach at at TESL and actually

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,880
co-ounded it with a fellow MIT alum as

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,960
well. So what we work on at Tesla is

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,880
virtual tissues, basically models to

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,160
simulate how human organs behave in

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,320
health and disease um by way of labin

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,320
the loop experimentation in order to

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
identify better drug targets and design

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
real drugs for largely chronic

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,920
inflammatory and fibroic conditions.

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
These are the settings where there's

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,000
just massive unmet need. Uh where

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,520
despite all of the advances we've seen

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,600
in uh biioarma, these diseases remain

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
largely refractory to many existing

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,920
therapies or people ultimately fail on

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,840
next-gen therapies and new ones are

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
needed. And the best models of human

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
biology to enable discovery for these

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,600
conditions are actually the ones that

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,360
tend to be the hardest to scale. Uh

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
putting aside the issue of a human in a

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
clinical trial which is just you know

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,000
the ultimate in in an unscalable disease

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,760
model um the best proxies you can find

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
for things like lung disease which we

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,759
work on very actively at Tesla uh also

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,159
bowel disease Crohn's etc are actually

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,680
cells drawn from patients taken from

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,720
patients that are grown in these

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,280
organotypic settings in which they uh

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,920
behave quite a bit like the uh tissue of

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,479
interest or the tissue of origin and in

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
those settings it's not just that you're

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
able to grow the tissue in the right

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,400
structure. They actually carry out and

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,640
exhibit behaviors that are quite

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
reminiscent of uh what actually happens

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,759
in people and can be measured in a

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,360
doctor's office. What you might call

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,439
clinical end points in a dish and this

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
is things like mucus production by lung

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,560
cells from patients with COPD. This is

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,960
things like stiffness of tissue uh in

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,479
fibrodic models of what happens in the

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
intestine of a patient with severe

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,880
Crohn's. So we should be using these

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,119
sorts of models for discovery and

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,799
validation of targets and drugs and in

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,360
fact optimization as well of those

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
drugs. But it's the complexity of these

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
systems and their cost which limits

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,720
their use in discovery where they could

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
really be most impactful. So where these

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,879
systems are used today is largely um

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,599
sort of after the main uh heavy lifting

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,239
of discovery is done more or less to

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,760
generate supplemental data for uh a

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,480
pre-clinical or clinical development

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,280
package rather than as the machine from

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,200
which a novel therapeutic hypothesis

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
emerged and in which it was validated.

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,800
So really that's what we're focused on

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
at Tessle is making it possible to scale

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
up these models through a combination of

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
a lot of work on the wet lab side to

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,519
make these systems more scalable but

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,239
also primarily our active learning

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,560
powered uh AI powered engine on the dry

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,480
lab side which allows us to simulate the

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,040
functional behaviors of tissues in

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,519
silico so that we can iteratively pick

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,920
and focus on the subset of perturbations

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
to test in vitro the subset of targets

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,640
to perturb using methods like crisper in

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,159
order to find novel targets that can

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,080
actually modify uh the disease behaviors

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
uh that we wish to reverse in a person.

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
And in fact, using this approach, we've

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,120
uh developed our own drugs. We've

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,760
identified and nominated and even um

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
secured chemical matter for uh a target

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
that would reverse goblet cell

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
hyperplasia and lung disease. So in

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,360
patients with diseases from COPD and

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
asthma to bronchiactis

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,560
um which are characterized by overp

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,319
production of mucus which makes it very

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
hard to breathe even if the underlying

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,519
disease is theoretically under control.

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,680
We have a therapy which can actually uh

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
reverse that problematic disease state.

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,200
But the underlying approach here allows

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,159
us to use and harness the power of

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,959
patient derived cells which model those

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,799
kinds of complex organ dysfunction in

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,799
settings where brute force screening is

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
just not possible or intractable. And in

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
fact in many different ways we've been

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,040
able to show that our approach is up to

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,920
30x more efficient than you know just

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,920
doing a uh unbiased brute force screen

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,599
using a large library of compounds or

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,840
perturbations.

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,159
And so our traction to date, we've been

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
able to use this approach uh in order to

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,160
as I said identify and nominate our own

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
drug candidates and expect uh to

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
nominate a development candidate at some

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
point next year. But we've also been

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,639
able to extend and apply this platform

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,320
beyond our focus area in the lung. Uh

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
currently working with two of the top 10

121
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
pharma companies. We've got a research

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,360
collaboration going uh focused on

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
identifying and screening target

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
combinations which are relevant for

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
example for multisspecific antibbody

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,000
design. We've got a pilot with another

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,919
top 10 pharma company to deploy some of

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,919
these organoid models for uh

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,840
inflammatory bowel disease. And we've

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,199
also recently secured uh some support

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,199
from ARPA to expand our work on tissues

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
to the setting of admetox prediction as

133
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,080
well. So of course there are many

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,240
diseases of things like the intestine uh

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,720
where modeling human intestine in a dish

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,639
is useful but the intestine is also the

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,280
front door for most medicines that we

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,880
take today and therefore therapies for

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,440
any disease in any organ ultimately have

140
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,759
something to do with the availability of

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
a molecule and its ability to transport

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
across the intestinal barrier. So these

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
are all settings in which we have a

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,880
growing portfolio of capabilities in

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,639
which we're already working with

146
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
commercial partners and we're actively

147
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,840
looking for additional research

148
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
collaborations including beyond this

149
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
core focus of immunology that I've

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,440
already discussed uh as well as

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,840
potentially co-development opportunities

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
for our lead molecule which is advancing

153
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,160
towards the clinic. Thanks.

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,639
>> Thanks Nan. Um first question um what

155
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,880
about the model for lungs for babies?

156
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,080
Uh, sorry. Lungs for babies, you said.

157
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,600
>> Yes. The model that you're working on,

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
but for babies.

159
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
>> For babies. Yeah. In fact, I I think a

160
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,400
lot of the potential for approaches like

161
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,919
ours is to essentially expand into

162
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,680
settings where um there are unserved or

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,280
underserved patient populations and we

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,880
can take advantage of the fact that we

165
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,400
can get or use tissue from specific

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,720
patient types including let's say

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,039
pediatric patients, right? So um I mean

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,479
I think the unfortunate truth of drug

169
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,520
development is that pediatric drug

170
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,600
development is complicated hard uh not

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,600
necessarily incentivized the right way

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,919
but it's also a setting in which I think

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
what's missing is the ability to

174
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,240
extrapolate right and to say here are

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,199
the treatments and dosing regimes that

176
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
have been approved for adults. um can we

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,240
use a system like what we've developed

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,639
at TESSL in order to essentially develop

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,520
the cipher or or figure out what is the

180
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,240
way to translate the uh the therapies

181
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,039
and the targets and the dosing amounts

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,120
to this new uh patient population which

183
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,479
could include for example uh younger

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
children and in fact we've thought about

185
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,319
this a little bit more in the context of

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,240
IBD in the context of the gut where for

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,680
example uh even standard of care

188
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
therapies like anti-TNF are not um

189
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
widely used in children in in quite the

190
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
same way they are in adults. Um but it's

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,520
certainly applicable in the context uh

192
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,319
of the lung as well like asthma is a

193
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,400
very big unmet need. Uh viral neutrfilic

194
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
asthma is a very big unmet need and

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,240
problem in in young children as you I'm

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
sure many of us are aware uh especially

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,919
if we have our own.

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,160
>> Yes. No, that's good to know. Um and on

199
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,120
your platform how did you determine that

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
it's the efficiency is like tenfold?

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,759
Yeah. So there's two ways of doing it

202
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,759
basically. Retrospective and

203
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,520
prospective. So a retrospective approach

204
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,280
is to say hey look we've got our

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,880
algorithms here. It's what's you know

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
illustrated partially here by this

207
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,440
active learning loop of um you know

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
taking data feeding it into our model

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,479
making a prediction and then updating

210
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,560
the model based off of the results.

211
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,759
Right? That approach you can essentially

212
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,160
pretend you had done that on uh many

213
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
many existing data sets. Right? There

214
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
are people out there who have screened

215
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,120
the effect of perturbing every single

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
gene in many different cell types and

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,080
they've measured the the phenotypes, the

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,919
outcomes. Uh and so in that setting, uh

219
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,639
that was brute force, right? Somebody

220
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,319
tested 20,000 different conditions at

221
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,080
least uh to generate data. uh and if we

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,800
essentially say hey had we taken our

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,599
approach and you know uh generated

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,160
batches of predictions and used that to

225
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,400
converge on the top answers and stop

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,959
when we declared ourselves to be done.

227
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,599
Uh we frequently find that you need you

228
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,279
know as few as a thousand or 2,000

229
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,120
perturbations to identify all of the

230
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,599
same top targets. And so that's where

231
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,240
you get you know this 10x 20x speed up

232
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,320
is saying a,000 versus 20,000 or 2,000

233
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
versus 20,000. But we can actually show

234
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
also perspectively that that reads

235
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,640
through to our own uh work. So we have

236
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,800
ongoing target discovery efforts in lung

237
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,360
disease where we have some of these

238
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,160
benchmarks and we say hey look you know

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,839
if to date we've perturbed 200 genes in

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,279
the setting of our lung screens and

241
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,560
we've identified already uh you know 40

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,480
uh 40 hits active hits um how much

243
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,600
higher is that hit rate than what we

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,120
naively expected by chance from uh the

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,519
sort of brute force screens or those

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,360
random benchmarks and in that setting

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
we're doing at least 5x better. So

248
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
that's that's the sort of way that we

249
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,480
keep ourselves honest. Um it's a it's a

250
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,839
fun and complex detail I think of AI and

251
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,920
biology that benchmarks are uh uh hard

252
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,360
to define but extremely valuable to know

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
how you're doing. And so if anyone wants

254
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,600
to talk about that I'm happy to as well.

255
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
>> Thank you. Good to know. Thank you.

256
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
Thanks again.
