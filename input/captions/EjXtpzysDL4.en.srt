1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,279
Okay. So, uh let me just recall first

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,279
that

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320
so what we were talking about so this is

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,439
a very important concept uh of a

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,400
sequence concept of a sequence.

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:34,320
So sequence is is the formal definition

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,200
is that you have a map from the natural

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,200
number into R

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,079
and then we denote so then the image of

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,760
a particular natural number n it's

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,840
usually denoted like a n like this you

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,320
know it could be some other instead of a

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
it could be bn potentially it could be

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,280
another subscript but it's this is like

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
the most common thing to denote it like

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,520
this instead of like but it really is a

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,520
function. Okay, so that's a sequence a

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,520
subsequence.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,000
So subsequence is that you have a

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,520
sequence and then you have another map

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,560
but this map is not just any map from

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,200
the integers to the integers. It has to

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,200
be strictly increasing.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,000
And why does it have to be strictly

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,439
increasing? Because we want for the

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,960
subsequence. If you think about the

27
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,079
numbers that come out when you plug in a

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,600
when you're looking at the a then you

29
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
want

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,680
some of those numbers to be in the

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,399
subsequence, but you want the ordering

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
to be the same. So this map so that's

33
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
why this map has to be strictly

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,960
increasing right can't sort of I mean

35
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,600
you and you can't pick the several

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,479
elements many times if it wasn't picked

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,560
many times in the original uh sequence

38
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,399
right

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,440
so this is so a subsequence is where you

40
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,280
have another map from the natural number

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,520
to the natural number that is strictly

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,239
increasing and then you're looking at

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,560
the composition of these two maps so

44
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,560
you're looking at sorry uh this thing

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
here

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,280
right and you call this here and then

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,640
that's usually

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,360
denoted something

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,080
like this a n k a n is the original

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,560
sequence k means that it's really that

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,959
you take the image of k under this

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,800
strictly increasing map and then you're

53
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,720
looking at the element in the sequence

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:51,519
right so it's sort of n k is really you

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:55,040
should think about it as G of K.

56
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,599
Okay, so that's that's what a a a

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,760
subsequence is. And again, it's

58
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,840
important that it's strictly increasing

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,840
because you want the elements to be in

60
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
the same order than it was in the

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
original sequence. And you don't want

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,879
things you don't even want things to be

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,959
picked more times than it was in

64
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,280
original sequence. Mhm. So that that's

65
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,599
that's you know so this this whole

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,120
concept of a sequence of subunits is

67
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:27,840
really important. Then

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,440
the next really important concept is

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,480
uh is of convergence.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,599
So if you have a sequence a n then you

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,319
say that is converging to a. So so a is

72
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,440
another real number. It's not infinity.

73
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:48,599
is another real number and so a n

74
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,599
converts. So a n converts

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:59,560
to a if for all

76
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,560
epsilon greater than zero there exist

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,840
n an integer n you know by capital n

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,079
such that if little n is bigger equal to

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:21,040
this capital n then a n minus minus a

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,840
have to be less than epsilon. Right? of

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,520
those. So if you are sufficiently far

82
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,040
out in sequence then everything in that

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,000
sequence is bunch epsilon close to a

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,240
okay that's what it's saying

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,720
and so as if you have a sequence

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,720
so a sequence

87
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,440
that

88
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
is not convergent

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,160
uh is set to be divergent.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,840
Okay.

91
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,080
Um and the next thing for sequences is

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,320
[Applause]

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm just briefly reviewing this from

94
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,960
last time. The next thing for sequences

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
are the are the break

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,720
to break uh

97
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,720
uh laws or whatever you want to call

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
them.

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,520
And so that is that if you take a

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:40,199
sequence, if you have a sequence a n and

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,199
a n converts to a bn converts to b

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,759
then if you form the sum of these two

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,240
uh a

104
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,560
n + bn.

105
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,440
So this is a new sequence where the nth

106
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,080
element is the sum of the nth element of

107
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,520
the other two sequences. then this

108
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,840
sequence here CN also converge and the

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:09,120
limit here is the sum of the limits.

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:13,039
Okay. And likewise if you take a if

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,800
you're looking at at if you define a

112
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,600
sequence so this was one

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,400
two is that if you take a constant so

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,120
this is a constant

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:31,120
and you define cn to be c * a n then

116
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,639
this cn also converge and the limit here

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,759
is just c * a right that's the second

118
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,319
one then uh this one I might have done

119
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,039
it in the other order but there's no you

120
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,199
know it's not you know there's no

121
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,400
particular order

122
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,319
um to have it in.

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,479
Uh the third one is that if you are

124
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,199
looking at the product. So if you define

125
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,599
a sequence that is given by the product

126
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,759
of the two then C and converge also and

127
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:11,520
the limit is the product of the limits.

128
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:16,160
And then the fourth rule is that if a n

129
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,319
is not equal to zero for all n and the

130
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,360
limit here

131
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,400
is also not equal to zero. Then if

132
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,440
you're looking at 1 / a n then those

133
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,919
converge to one.

134
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,160
Okay. So those are the four four the

135
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,199
four roots.

136
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,560
Just write it as four. And again, it's

137
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,639
not like there's any particular

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,720
convention with the ordering. And I

139
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
think I might have done it. I might have

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,680
exchanged the order of one and two last

141
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,680
time. But

142
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,960
okay. Um now, uh let's see an example of

143
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,160
how that works.

144
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:05,360
So let's define a sequence.

145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:09,199
Uh let's define a sequence uh n 2 + 1 n

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,840
2 + uh n +

147
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,080
uh + one. Let's look at this sequence

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,000
here right for each n that give us uh

149
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,919
actually a rational number but it's only

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,879
real number.

151
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,479
Now in order to understand this I can

152
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,479
rewrite this one here as I can factor

153
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:35,080
out 1 / n well I can factor out n squ

154
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,080
here. So I can write it like this

155
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,580
[Applause]

156
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,800
like that. And then of course I can get

157
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,760
rid of the n squ

158
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,320
in both denominator and denominator. And

159
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,160
now I can look so so this so you may as

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,560
well think about the sequence as this

161
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:04,240
thing here. So now if I defined um so

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,519
now I can just look at say uh I can look

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,760
at uh the sequence which is one I can

164
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
just first look at the sequence which is

165
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,800
1 / n. If I'm looking at this sequence

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,399
here, right, one / n, this here converts

167
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
to zero. This is essentially just

168
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,880
followed from the ardian property,

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,560
right? But we already we've already seen

170
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:30,560
this that 1 / n converts to zero.

171
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,839
And the same hold for 1 / n^2, right?

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,680
This here also converts to zero, right?

173
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,000
And so if you're looking at the

174
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,920
sequence, you could even look at the

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,920
sequence.

176
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,680
Let's call this x n. This here is yn.

177
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,519
I'm going to run out of character very

178
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,399
quickly. Uh set n. This is just going to

179
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,959
be the sequence which is constant one.

180
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,600
Right? Well, if if it's constant one,

181
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,839
then obviously it's converging to one,

182
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:06,000
right? And so now I can just think about

183
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:12,000
I can think about the sequence bn

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:18,959
to be equal to x sorry equal to set

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:22,160
plus uh y set n plus yn right this here

186
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,120
is a sequence here is what yn is here's

187
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,560
what set n is right so if you add these

188
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,360
two this is converging to one this is

189
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,959
converging to zero by the algebraic

190
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,640
property of limits this converts also to

191
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,560
the sum of the limit so this here

192
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,760
converts to one right now I can also

193
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:48,000
define a sequence where I'm just adding

194
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:52,760
set in and then I'm adding x in and then

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm adding y in right

196
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,800
this here converts to one this here to

197
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,320
zero

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,120
this here to zero. So the sum here also

199
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
converge to the sum of the limit but the

200
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,440
sum of the limits is one.

201
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Now you have that

202
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,480
one over c sorry now you have that

203
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,959
put it up here and then then I will I'll

204
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,959
just go over here.

205
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,720
So now you have that um that CN

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,279
converts to one.

207
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,680
Um and let's call this here C. And so in

208
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,079
in particular, I mean all of these

209
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
numbers here, these things here are all

210
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,079
strictly positive. So each of the CN are

211
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,920
strictly positive. So they're definitely

212
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,040
not zero, right? So the CN so not only

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,480
do they converge to one but the CN are

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,720
not equal to zero and the limit C well

215
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,920
that's one so that's of course not equal

216
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,600
to zero either right so you can apply

217
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:09,040
the fourth rule here the fourth rule for

218
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,399
the sequence not for the sequence CN not

219
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,040
right so apply the fourth rule to the

220
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,600
sequence CN and then you have that one

221
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:24,240
over CN converge to one / c. But one c

222
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:31,120
was one. So this is one. Right?

223
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:37,120
Now you can look at at um at bn

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:41,360
* 1 / cn. But bn * 1 / cn, right?

225
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,399
Remember what bn was? Here's bn. And bn

226
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,800
is really the denominator up here.

227
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,680
Right? It's the nominator up here. when

228
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,240
you have divided by n squ on both sides

229
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,480
uh by not on both sides but both in the

230
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,959
top and the denominator.

231
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:03,040
So bn is the denominator and cn is the

232
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,760
denominator. So bn divided by CN this

233
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,639
here is a n right

234
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,279
and now this here converge that's what

235
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,399
we saw over there using the algebraic

236
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,560
rule it converts to one this here also

237
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,800
converts to one by the algebraic rules

238
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,200
number three of the algebraic rules is

239
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,920
that for the product it will also

240
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:31,040
converge so and it converts to the

241
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,560
product of the limits so that's one

242
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,800
And obviously so I you know this is like

243
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,560
when you're looking at a sequence it's

244
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,880
often uh expressed in some form with

245
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:48,000
some functions like this and you and you

246
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,760
do this reduction and very quickly you

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,160
know this would be almost automatic

248
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,680
right I mean this is too easy almost

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,000
this one I mean you know this is the

250
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,160
first time you see it but you know in in

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
a couple of weeks this will feel uh too

252
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,560
easy uh then then there would be

253
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,560
something more complicated.

254
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay.

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,680
So that's that's the algebraic rules uh

256
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,000
of for sequences.

257
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,040
The next thing I want to talk about is I

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,760
want to try to make more precise

259
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,360
um you know this about square. I mean,

260
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,680
you know, we made it pretty precise, but

261
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,360
I want to think about

262
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,000
uh uh I don't have a very good eraser,

263
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,959
unfortunately. Let me just see. This is

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,199
a better one.

265
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:42,000
This one here will make it very dirty.

266
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:44,320
Okay. So, so the next thing I want to

267
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,560
So, we did define square of two and we

268
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,760
talked about that quite extensively. how

269
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,480
square root two, you know, how it really

270
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,000
was defined and it was a real number and

271
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:01,440
the real numbers followed from

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,040
that the field the reals is complete.

273
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,720
But we also

274
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,240
we also sort of in the back of our mind

275
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,000
we had that we already sort of knew what

276
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,480
square root of two were, right? Because

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,160
when you think about square root two, I

278
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,880
mean at least I think about square root

279
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,800
two. I think about it as 1.4. I mean

280
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,279
just because you can't really express it

281
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,279
as a fraction. So you think about it as

282
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,120
1.414

283
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
etc. And then I don't remember I don't

284
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
remember the second years third and

285
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,440
fourth whatever but you know you may

286
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,079
remember just a few of the digits fine

287
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,199
and but so how do we make so so that's

288
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,639
sort of our intuition

289
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,680
uh with 1.4 four with with square two.

290
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,920
Uh but how do we make this more precise?

291
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:58,160
Right? And so to make this more precise,

292
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:02,000
we want to look at particular sequences.

293
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,000
So what's called monotone

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
sequences?

295
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,639
So what is a mono sequence?

296
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,519
So there's two types of monotom

297
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,079
sequence. There's one which is monot

298
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,079
increasing sequence

299
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,240
and then there's similarly monotum

300
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,560
decreasing sequence. So a monotum

301
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,279
increasing sequence this is just means

302
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,279
that for all n

303
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,480
you have that the next element is larger

304
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,839
or equal to the previous element. That's

305
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,079
a mono increasing sequence. Right? Some

306
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,000
people talk about strictly monotum

307
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,000
increasing and then this have to be a

308
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
strict.

309
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,799
Uh the second thing is kind of the

310
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,799
obvious parallel to this is monoton

311
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,799
decreasing

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,640
decreasing sequences.

313
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,120
So that's these two types. Okay. And

314
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,439
this just means that the next element so

315
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,760
a n + one is less or equal to the

316
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,760
previous one.

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,440
Okay.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,400
And so now there's a theorem and and

319
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,039
I'll prove this in a in just a minute.

320
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,039
But I also want to

321
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,280
and I want to come back to square root

322
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,360
of two and then I want to look at

323
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:55,000
another

324
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,000
classical example of a monotum sequence.

325
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,960
So

326
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,280
um

327
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,679
right so this is a mono sequence and now

328
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,679
let me state the mono convergence

329
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,679
theorem.

330
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,840
So suppose that so this is the following

331
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,840
theorem. Suppose that

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,559
that and there's two versions of this.

333
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,640
There's one version for monotum

334
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,120
increasing sequence and then there's one

335
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,880
version for mono decreasing sequence. I

336
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,440
just state one of them because the other

337
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:43,320
one's kind of obvious parallel. So

338
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,320
suppose that a end is a monotone

339
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,869
increasing sequence

340
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,869
[Applause]

341
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,200
then it is bounded

342
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,760
bounded. So this just means that there

343
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,640
exists

344
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
i.e.

345
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,320
[Applause]

346
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,320
there exist

347
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,160
some a real number.

348
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,480
So that's

349
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,280
right. You have a1 this here is that is

350
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,520
monotum right this is monotum that they

351
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,679
cannot increase but but the claim is

352
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,799
that now the all of the a is lesser

353
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,360
equal to this a

354
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,480
it's any monotum increasing sequence is

355
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,559
clearly bounded from below right because

356
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,840
already the first element is a lower

357
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:50,160
bound right so if you have a mono

358
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,200
increasing sequence then Um

359
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,200
then uh that is bounded then it's

360
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
convergence

361
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:07,799
and

362
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,799
uh we limit say we limit

363
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,360
a

364
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,799
where

365
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,600
a is the soup

366
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,600
of the a inch.

367
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:36,320
So that is a mono convergence sequence.

368
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,200
Okay. and and and that is the the kind

369
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,080
of main theorem about mono convergent

370
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,320
sequence is that if you have a monotum

371
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
increasing sequence

372
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,520
that is bounded then it's also

373
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,559
convergence right and likewise if you

374
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,440
have a monotum decreasing sequence that

375
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,840
is bounded from below

376
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,960
right then it is also convergent and so

377
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:07,559
maybe maybe I will state it

378
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,559
u but it's is the obvious parallel.

379
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,640
So,

380
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:16,799
so this is part one

381
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:22,000
of the monome converting sequence.

382
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:27,400
Part two of part B is that if

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,400
if A is a monotone

384
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,120
decreasing sequence

385
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,840
sequence

386
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,559
then

387
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,320
uh that is bounded uh that is

388
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,320
that is bounded from below.

389
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Then

390
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:03,520
uh a is convergent

391
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:07,000
with limit a where a is now the in

392
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,000
of these numbers.

393
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Okay.

394
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,520
Now,

395
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
so you might say the first thing you

396
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,039
might say, we'll come to square root two

397
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,360
in just a minute, but you may see that

398
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,440
this seems rather special, you know,

399
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,799
like if you take a random uh sequence,

400
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,799
obviously it's not going to be monitor.

401
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:45,080
Um but but here's the thing that so

402
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,080
uh let

403
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,720
be any bounded sequence.

404
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,200
So bounded again means that it's bounded

405
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,039
from above and bounded from below. So if

406
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:10,039
you take any boundless sequence

407
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,039
then we can form two other sequences.

408
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,120
Two other sequences

409
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,840
I mean obviously form many other but

410
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,559
here's two other very natural

411
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,559
uh sequences.

412
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:34,679
The first one I call BN

413
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,679
and BN is is the soup

414
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,679
of where you're taking where you're

415
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,080
starting at a end

416
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:48,159
and then you take the soup of all of the

417
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:52,320
ones from A in and outwards in the

418
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,840
sequence. Right? So this is one

419
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,880
sequence

420
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,200
right we know that that you know the set

421
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,799
of a ends is bounded right so you can

422
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,520
certainly take the soup and you get a

423
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,760
real number right that's that that gives

424
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,880
you another sequence

425
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,960
you can also look at cn similarly where

426
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,320
you take instead of the soup you take

427
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,320
the in of the same that

428
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,720
[Applause]

429
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,720
like that. All right. So, in particular,

430
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,720
right, just to make sure it's totally

431
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
clear

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,120
that

433
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,480
that if you were looking at

434
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,559
say BN, so what is BN? If you're looking

435
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,679
at say B3

436
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:45,600
then this is the soup where you're

437
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,679
starting at A3 A4

438
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,159
etc.

439
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:57,200
And so you see of course that B23 here

440
00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:02,480
well obviously B3 is bigger equal

441
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,880
to B2 right because B2 here

442
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,919
is sorry it's no it's not bigger equal

443
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,880
to it's lesser equal to B2

444
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,559
because you see in B2 the definition of

445
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:19,600
B2 so let's just write B2 down

446
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:23,120
so B2 is that you take the soup here of

447
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,760
A2 and then A3

448
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,960
A4 etc.

449
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Right? But you see that B2 here it's

450
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,480
both of them are defined to be soup but

451
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:39,279
B2 is defined as soup over a larger set

452
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,400
because in addition to these elements it

453
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:48,320
also includes A2 right. So clearly B2

454
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,559
here is bigger equal to B3

455
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:56,240
right and in fact the same argument

456
00:25:50,559 --> 00:26:01,760
tells you that if you take B

457
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:06,640
n + one then this is or bn sorry bn is

458
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:10,400
bigger equal to bn + one

459
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,679
because this here is the soup over a

460
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:18,159
larger set it's soup over all the ones

461
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:21,520
you take soup in here plus a n right so

462
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,240
you have this property here right and so

463
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,640
yeah

464
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,640
>> what do you

465
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,039
Yeah.

466
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,320
If it's a monot increasing um

467
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,159
>> yeah because monotum increasing uh then

468
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,159
this here uh right yeah then it becomes

469
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,919
very special.

470
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,919
Uh so it's it's if you take a mon if the

471
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:51,279
a was monoton increasing then the all of

472
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,520
these any element here would just be the

473
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,520
a we talked about before it would always

474
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,279
be the limit.

475
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,200
So so it's um it's it somehow wouldn't

476
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,600
be that interesting a sequence. It would

477
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,360
be a constant sequence and and it would

478
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,159
be just

479
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,320
>> but but but that but nevertheless it's a

480
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,840
good example you know. I guess that's

481
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
still anybody.

482
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Right. Because

483
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,720
it's just constant. Exactly.

484
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
>> It's a it's a good example, but it's

485
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,960
just kind of almost like too simple

486
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
because you get a constant sequence,

487
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,480
right?

488
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,279
So, okay. So, we have for this sequence

489
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,080
that we defined. So we have again these

490
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,080
if you take any sequence then you get

491
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:39,840
then you have two sequences B and a CN

492
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,960
and B and here is now a decreasing

493
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,559
sequence and in instead of writing

494
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,480
decreasing sequence then uh it's much

495
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,880
easier to write it like this. This is

496
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,200
pretty standard. I mean you know it's

497
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,600
just to uh if you just look quickly at

498
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,440
it uh you know what this means.

499
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,600
going to write out but let's look at CN

500
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,600
also

501
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,520
remember that we assume that a n we a

502
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,480
could be any sequence but it is supposed

503
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,679
to be bounded right so this is now a

504
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:20,240
monotum decreasing sequence that is

505
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:26,240
bounded so it actually has a limit right

506
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:28,000
the cs what about the cs so the cns

507
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
So

508
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,679
the CN

509
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:39,360
well CN was defined to be the in

510
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,679
starting at a end

511
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,679
like that

512
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,120
right

513
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:54,080
so it' be starting like that and so this

514
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:57,440
means that if you take CN + one

515
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,919
then you take the infom But you don't

516
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,120
include this element. Right? So it's a

517
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,880
infreum over fewer elements. But then

518
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,760
this here must be larger equal

519
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,159
right to that. So you see that the

520
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,720
sequence CN

521
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,399
is monotum. This here is monotum

522
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,919
increasing again is bounded and and and

523
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,000
just copying from over there. The BN was

524
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,799
decreasing.

525
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,600
>> Okay. This is like I mean it's also like

526
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,080
I mean this is an important thing. It's

527
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,039
also something that you would see in lot

528
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,320
of different context where you define

529
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,399
something some sort of sub and then you

530
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,600
have these property

531
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,120
and so now the thing is that if you're

532
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,000
looking at so aure it might not be so

533
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,760
clear to compare a random element in

534
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,279
this sequence to a random element in

535
00:29:51,760 --> 00:30:00,799
that but what is clear is that if you

536
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:03,279
try to compare BN with CN And

537
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,799
right

538
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,799
it's the same set. It's the same set.

539
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,840
And one you take the soup, the other you

540
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,000
take the in. So of course BN is bigger

541
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,240
equal to CN,

542
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,399
right? So you have this, right? And so

543
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,039
now you see that if you take like a

544
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:25,679
random element here, if it was like

545
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:29,760
further out, if it was N, sorry, if it

546
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,240
was C N further out, I just write it as

547
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,480
something further out. So you adding

548
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,279
something else to it. So this would be

549
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,279
like further out. We know that this

550
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,840
sequence here.

551
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,399
Yeah. Anyway, so you get Sorry, now

552
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,159
you're getting this. I'm getting this

553
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,480
here.

554
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,480
like that

555
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,640
and right so you have this so what you

556
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,360
should what I should have done is that

557
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,640
this sequence here so you have so let

558
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,039
let me rather draw it like this so I

559
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:09,279
have that this that so here is maybe C1

560
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:13,440
here is B1

561
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:16,799
and now the next one the next element

562
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,640
the sequence C n is increasing and the

563
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,480
sequence

564
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,480
bn is decreasing. So then but you always

565
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,440
have this here. So c2 have to lie to the

566
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,919
right of this but it has to lie to the

567
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,559
left of b2.

568
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,559
So you're getting this here.

569
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,480
So, so you see that this is a way to

570
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,880
kind of you know this gives you a way to

571
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,600
compare right that that the CN will

572
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,320
always lie to the left of the BN.

573
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:53,559
So you have so so now what we have done

574
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,559
here is we took any boundary sequence

575
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,720
and we formed two mono sequences.

576
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,720
They're both mono

577
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,840
And we have so so this means that now

578
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,320
from the monot convergence that we

579
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,399
haven't quite proven yet but from the

580
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,440
mono convergence uh convergence theorem

581
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:26,640
because these are bounded we have that

582
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,480
bm converge converging they are going uh

583
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,640
they're going down right so they're

584
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,399
converging so one often would write it

585
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,279
like this more suggestively

586
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:39,279
that is converging downward to a limit B

587
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,640
and the CN

588
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:48,159
is converging upward to a limit C.

589
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,360
Right? And so what you get is because of

590
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,640
all of these elements, all the C ends

591
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,760
lie to the left of the B ends. This

592
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,240
means that and we we'll prove this later

593
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,519
but it seems probably pretty obvious

594
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,559
that the limit here C is less or equal

595
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,120
to B

596
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,080
and this so we'll come back to this also

597
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,000
next time um when we talked I if I have

598
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,159
time I'll talk a little bit about cushy

599
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,159
sequence but I won't really prove too

600
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,120
much about it and and and but this here

601
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,679
will play a important role

602
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,320
uh when we prove the the basic theorem

603
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,120
about cushy sequences.

604
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,519
Okay. So so the takeaway here at the

605
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,399
moment is just that uh so you have you

606
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,640
have this concept of a monot

607
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,240
uh either increasing or decreasing

608
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,240
sequence. If such a sequence is bounded

609
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,919
then it's convergent. That's a mono

610
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,519
convergence theorem. And again from any

611
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,760
sequence

612
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,240
any boundary sequence you can act that's

613
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,320
there that's a very natural mono

614
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,440
increasing sequence and a very natural

615
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,440
mono decreasing sequence.

616
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,200
Now let's try to prove the monotom

617
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,639
convergence theorem and then let's get

618
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,679
back to how to think about square root

619
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,300
of two in a more intuitive way using

620
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,129
this.

621
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,129
[Applause]

622
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,960
Okay. So now the proof of the monome.

623
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,079
So we So now let me just remind you what

624
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,320
we have.

625
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,440
So I'm only going to prove one of the

626
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,920
two versions of it where the sequence is

627
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,839
monotum increasing because the other one

628
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,440
is just proof is is just the same with

629
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,960
obvious modification. So I'm assuming so

630
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,760
this is the assumption.

631
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,760
So this is the assumption.

632
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,640
So, so this is just that the next

633
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,240
element is larger equal to the previous

634
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,000
one and they're all bounded by this a

635
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,240
right

636
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,880
now I take I we set

637
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:49,480
little a equal to the soup

638
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,480
uh of the a

639
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Okay.

640
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,599
And I want to show we want to show

641
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,839
that a converts to a.

642
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,320
Now to do that what we need is we need

643
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,800
this stuff about that for a given

644
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,680
epsilon there exist a capital n.

645
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,760
Okay. So now let me first make the

646
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,760
observation

647
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,760
that

648
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,520
that the that the soup right so a here

649
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,520
since

650
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,520
a here is the soup

651
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,040
it is

652
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,200
right. Remember that the soup of a set

653
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:02,160
is the smallest upper bound right so but

654
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,560
since it is so it's partic so a is in

655
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:10,839
particular an upper bound so you have

656
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,839
that a n is less than a for all n

657
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,480
since

658
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,240
a is an upper bound. It's actually the

659
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,280
smallest upper bound. But for this you

660
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,280
just need it's a upper bound.

661
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,119
Okay.

662
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:37,680
So I'm going to look at a n sorry I'm

663
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:40,160
going to look at a minus a n.

664
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,040
And what I want to prove is that for a

665
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,320
given epsilon if I'm sufficiently far

666
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,400
out if I'm bigger than some capital if

667
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,800
little n is bigger than some capital n

668
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,119
then this here is less than epsilon

669
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,599
right that's what I want to prove but

670
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,520
this thing here you see this here I

671
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,200
don't need the absolute value because I

672
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,079
already know that this is bigger than

673
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,920
that so I don't need the absolute value

674
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,240
so I can just so this is what I want to

675
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,000
prove that I want to prove that for

676
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,320
given

677
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,320
given epsilon greater than zero there

678
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,320
exist.

679
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,839
So maybe let me just write it a little

680
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,839
larger here. So what I want to prove is

681
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,760
that given

682
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,760
epsilon greater than zero there exist

683
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,040
a capital n such that

684
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:37,040
if little n is bigger equal to this

685
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,920
capital n then a minus a n which I know

686
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,640
is positive I just need to prove that

687
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,640
this is less than epsilon.

688
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Okay.

689
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,040
Now, so now how do you do that? Well,

690
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,440
I know.

691
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,960
So, at the moment, I just use that A was

692
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,839
an upper bound. Now, I'm going to use

693
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,720
that is the least upper bound.

694
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,720
So since

695
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,520
a is the least upper bound

696
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,200
then

697
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:26,760
uh a minus epsilon is not

698
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,760
an upper bound.

699
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,640
Right? A minus epsilon is not an upper

700
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,760
bound. So this means that there must

701
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,079
exist so

702
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,079
there exist

703
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:53,440
capital n so that a n is bigger or

704
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,240
equal. So a capital n just this one here

705
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,000
is bigger than a minus epsilon. Right?

706
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,440
because otherwise it would have been an

707
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,960
upper box but it's actually strictly but

708
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,359
maybe I should strictly because I'll put

709
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,920
it up.

710
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,920
Okay,

711
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,119
but I already know that this thing here

712
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,400
is less than a

713
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,720
so but and I also know in fact I know

714
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,960
more than this. I know that this thing

715
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,599
here is less or equal to a little n as

716
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,440
long as little n is bigger than capital

717
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,960
n. That was just because the sequence

718
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,760
was increasing and all of them is

719
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,960
smaller than this upper bound. So now

720
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:47,359
you see that so here you have a all the

721
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:50,960
elements a in lie to the left and if

722
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,240
you're looking at just the one from a

723
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,200
capital N outwards then here you have a

724
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,640
minus epsilon and then they lie between

725
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,520
this one here and that in particular

726
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,839
they lie to the right of this and to the

727
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,880
left of that. So this means that they're

728
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:11,280
squeezed in this little interval and

729
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,839
it's so this difference here this

730
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,640
difference from here to here is

731
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,040
certainly bounded by the distance to

732
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,599
here which was epsilon

733
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,560
right?

734
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,160
So this proved that this in here is less

735
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,400
than.

736
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,040
Okay.

737
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:36,800
And with obvious modification

738
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,800
uh the proof of that if you take so this

739
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,359
was an increasing sequence. The proof uh

740
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,720
that if you have a decreasing sequence

741
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,839
that is bounded right that that that the

742
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:57,160
limit of that is the in proof with

743
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:57,160
obvious changes is is know the same.

744
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,720
Okay.

745
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,520
So now let's come back to square root of

746
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,880
two. Right. And so we have this idea

747
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,960
that square<unk> two in a way the way

748
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,720
you know to just get an idea about how

749
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,640
large it is you think about it as uh you

750
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,720
know you think about it as one and then

751
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,160
a number of digits afterwards right

752
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,680
that's a kind of approximation

753
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,920
so so let's try to make this more

754
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,520
precise

755
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,590
Um

756
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,590
[Applause]

757
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,839
and so

758
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm going to look at a I'm going to

759
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,119
define

760
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:59,800
uh two sequence uh two sequences

761
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,800
uh a n and bn sorry two. So we'll define

762
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,720
two sequences

763
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:16,319
a n and bn

764
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:18,880
and a n will really be a n where

765
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,359
where a n

766
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:28,200
is going to be bn

767
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:28,200
/ 10 to ^ nus one.

768
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,280
Remember that anything to you know if

769
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,079
it's 10 to the power zero by definition

770
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,040
that's one. Okay. So this here in

771
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,640
particular means that a

772
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,640
a1 should be equal to b1.

773
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,200
And we're going to define it like this.

774
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:00,319
And we are

775
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:05,359
going to define the BN.

776
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:08,480
So and the sequences here the the so

777
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,680
there would be some properties here is

778
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,920
that the sequence

779
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,920
uh sequence

780
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,920
uh a is monotone

781
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,800
increasing

782
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,760
a just real numbers that it's monot

783
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,319
increasing

784
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:41,160
and um

785
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,160
and uh and the a

786
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:50,440
um is going to be defined to right so

787
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,440
and and and a is defined like that sorry

788
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:57,040
um and the bn

789
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,560
and the bn are just

790
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,760
natural numbers Okay.

791
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,079
So, so a n is defined from bn. It's

792
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,240
really a n that we are interested in,

793
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,920
but bn is going to be a useful tool

794
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,920
here. And so,

795
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,359
and it's going to be and the bn to some

796
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,000
extent is very simple because they're

797
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:23,280
just natural numbers.

798
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,119
So, now um so now we define

799
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,440
bn.

800
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,440
So bn

801
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,839
is the largest

802
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,960
natural number

803
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,560
such that

804
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,319
uh

805
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,319
b²

806
00:45:53,599 --> 00:46:00,640
is bigger and less or equal to 2 uh * uh

807
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,280
10

808
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:08,880
to the power 2 n - 2.

809
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,000
So that's how right so this here so this

810
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,240
so the sets of natural number that is

811
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,400
bounded by that right that's like a

812
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
finite set so you just take the max of

813
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,200
soup or whatever the max of that's it

814
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:25,000
right it's just the max of that's it so

815
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,000
that's a natural number

816
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,760
okay

817
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,119
and now

818
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,119
and now again we

819
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,119
right and then we define. So now we have

820
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,240
the bs

821
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,240
and then again a ends

822
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:52,240
the a

823
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:56,720
n are defined to be bn divided by 10 to

824
00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:01,520
the n minus one. Right? Right. And so

825
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:04,400
again you see that and so right. So now

826
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,119
the first thing you observe is that if n

827
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,680
is equal to one

828
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,880
if n is equal to one then this thing

829
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,839
here is zero so this means this has one

830
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,800
so it's the largest natural number so

831
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:21,280
that the square is less than two so this

832
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:26,000
means that bn

833
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:29,599
so n= to one bn is equal to one and

834
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,200
because this thing here is also

835
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:39,359
zero. So this the denominator is is one.

836
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:43,040
So a n a1 sorry a1 is one. b1 is one and

837
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,760
a1 has to be the same as b1. And so

838
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,839
that's also one.

839
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Okay. So that's how it starts.

840
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:57,119
And now what we want to prove is that um

841
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,280
we want to prove that the sequence a n

842
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,680
is monotm increasing right we want to

843
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,240
prove that a end is monotum increasing

844
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,520
so let's just try to understand that

845
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,160
right and so again for mono increasing

846
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,119
you just need to compare two consecutive

847
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:18,079
elements right so so we want to show

848
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,760
so so this here remember that there's a

849
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,760
kind of you know there's ways to write a

850
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,839
formal proof and then there's like

851
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,079
things you have on the scrap paper to

852
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,079
get the idea. So this is would be what

853
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,720
we're going on may maybe the first

854
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,680
statement is so we want to show this you

855
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,400
could certainly put as part of the proof

856
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,000
want to show

857
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,400
that

858
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,400
a n is less or equal to a n + one

859
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,240
and so this is equivalent

860
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,839
to

861
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:08,480
that right? So a n since a n here is

862
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:10,800
equal to bn / 10 ^ n minus 2. You want

863
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:16,400
to prove that this thing here is less

864
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:23,839
than a n + 1 which is b n + 1

865
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:31,520
over 10 to the n + 1 - one. So this here

866
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:35,119
is b n + 1 over 10 uh to the power n.

867
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:40,599
That's what you want to prove.

868
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,599
So we want to show so so you see that

869
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,040
we want to show so this is what we want

870
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,800
to prove that this thing here is less

871
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:56,480
than this. If you multiply by 10 to the^

872
00:49:50,800 --> 00:50:01,680
n on both sides then you get over here

873
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:05,880
and after you reduce it you get 10. So

874
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,880
en so need to show

875
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,359
needs to show

876
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,720
that 10

877
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:22,079
bn

878
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,839
is less or equal to bn + one

879
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,880
right that's what we need to prove right

880
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,280
and again this just comes from that you

881
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,119
we want to prove forget about the a now

882
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,359
you can just think about that we need to

883
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,880
prove that this in here is less than

884
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,920
this multiply over by 10 to the n on

885
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,839
both sides then there's still 10 * bn

886
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,559
left and here it's just b

887
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:50,160
okay so we need to show this one here

888
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,079
right and so if I was to write it down I

889
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,720
would probably have some of this on

890
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,640
scrap paper and then I would instead

891
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,319
sort of establish this here first and

892
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,640
then say therefore you know and then

893
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,839
I'll conclude why you So you but but of

894
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,760
course that's not the way you're

895
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,720
thinking about it right I mean you first

896
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,280
try to analyze what you have to prove

897
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,160
and then once you know that then you try

898
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:17,440
to write it down nicely

899
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,800
okay so so we need to prove this here

900
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:25,680
and so now

901
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:27,839
uh right so now the thing is that we

902
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,920
have

903
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:33,200
we have that so The definition of bn

904
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,280
which is right here that's the

905
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,440
definition of bn but let me copy it over

906
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,400
here. So we know that bn squared is less

907
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,520
or equal to it's the largest integer. So

908
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,760
that you have this in here,

909
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,680
right?

910
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,280
But this means that if you're looking at

911
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:56,079
10 bn, that's still an integer. And if

912
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,680
you square this here, right? Then this

913
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:03,599
is the same as 100

914
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:07,520
times bn squared. And so that's that

915
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:10,559
actually has to be less than 100 * this.

916
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:14,000
So this kills those uh I mean so it just

917
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,760
becomes less or equal to two 10 to the

918
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,400
2n

919
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,319
right like that

920
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:30,079
and this here you can also write as 2

921
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:33,839
to the 10 * 10 to ^ 2 n + 1 - 2 right

922
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:37,599
but now you see that bn so this so this

923
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:41,839
so 10 bn is an integer and it has this

924
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:44,559
property but bn + one was supposed to be

925
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:52,000
the largest integer so that the square

926
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:56,800
here is less than 2 * 10 to to 2 n + 1 -

927
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,839
2 you see that bn + one is a is the

928
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,359
largest one with this property so you

929
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:08,640
conclude that so since

930
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,640
bn + one is the largest such

931
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,920
and both are integers

932
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:24,000
and and bn is is an integer

933
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:26,079
then uh bn + one must be bigger equal to

934
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:31,960
bn

935
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,960
uh must be bigger than 10 * bn right

936
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,480
and that's exactly what we want to prove

937
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,319
right that that uh bn + one was bigger

938
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,520
than bn.

939
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:46,640
So we now have that the sequence a

940
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,200
defined this slightly cryptical way but

941
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,800
really it's not I mean it sounds maybe

942
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:56,240
cryptical but it's just to instead of

943
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,480
using somehow digital numbers you just

944
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,559
multiply you're just thinking about you

945
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:06,000
want this and that many uh by so uh like

946
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:09,440
the n is referring to the number of

947
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,280
digits but including the digit that is

948
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,359
for the the point right so it's actually

949
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,800
not very cryptical but it maybe sounds a

950
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:24,960
little formal here okay so we have a n

951
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:28,880
is a increasing sequence okay now why is

952
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:33,599
a n bounded right

953
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:36,319
so but the a is defined from the bn

954
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,599
so in order to show that a n is bounded

955
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:42,079
you have to figure out you have to

956
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,440
figure out what is a bound for the BN

957
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:49,680
right but you have this here bn is the

958
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:54,240
largest such number if I take if I take

959
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:57,599
two * 10 ^ n minus one suppose I take

960
00:54:54,240 --> 00:55:00,240
this number here right and I square it

961
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:06,240
this is a definitely a integer I square

962
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:09,119
it then I'm getting 4 * 10 ^ 2 n - 2

963
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,640
right so this thing here This here is

964
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,000
the same as over here but it's now four.

965
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,400
So this number here would not be allowed

966
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,760
as a bn. In fact it would be larger than

967
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:27,280
bn. Right? So this here so bn is less

968
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:30,280
than 2 to the^ 10 to the n minus one.

969
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Right?

970
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:39,760
So this means that a n

971
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:43,359
which is equal to bn over 10 ^ n minus

972
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,040
one but this is now you see less or

973
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:50,720
equal to two right

974
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,760
so the sequence a n that we have defined

975
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,240
is uh as you would have expected they

976
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,000
are they're increasing because they

977
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,760
really define the way they're really if

978
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,440
you think about it is really defined to

979
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,200
take you know the number of digits sort

980
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,559
of it's going to be like the number of

981
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:12,400
digits in square roo including the one

982
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:15,520
the starting one right

983
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,920
so and so

984
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:22,880
um and so they all are going to be less

985
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:26,599
than two right okay now

986
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,599
let's try to

987
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,799
Okay.

988
00:56:52,720 --> 00:57:01,359
Right. So now um we have so we have that

989
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:04,359
a n is an increasing sequence and is

990
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,359
bounded.

991
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,599
So a end here uh is convergent

992
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,119
by the monitor

993
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,160
uh convergence here.

994
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,480
Right? So the a is convergent by the

995
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:39,359
monotone convergence.

996
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:43,119
But now if I'm looking at a n squ a n

997
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:51,760
squ well a n squ it's the same as a end

998
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:55,839
obviously times a n right but um but um

999
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,240
but uh a n by definition was bn divided

1000
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:06,720
by 10

1001
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:10,799
uh uh 10 to the power uh n - one right

1002
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:14,160
and so I can write like this

1003
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:17,119
10 ^ n minus one and so you see that you

1004
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:21,760
can write this as bn^ squ and then these

1005
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:24,240
here combines to 2 n minus 2 right and

1006
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,559
by assumption

1007
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:31,319
if you divide by this here this thing

1008
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,319
here is lesser equal to two

1009
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:39,760
so you have that. So you have that a n

1010
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,680
converts to a. And if you want to think

1011
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,359
about it, you think about this sequence

1012
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,040
again.

1013
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,480
And so now you know that a n by this uh

1014
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,599
by the product rule for sequences a n

1015
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,480
times a n the sequence times itself is

1016
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,920
converging to a n square a square.

1017
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,359
Right?

1018
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:04,000
And this thing here because they are

1019
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:07,200
because each of these squares here each

1020
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,640
of them is less or equal to two then the

1021
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,640
limit must be lesser equal to two.

1022
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,319
What I want to prove now is that this a

1023
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,680
that we get as a limit that the square

1024
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:28,559
is in fact equal to two. So I want to

1025
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:31,839
show that it's the square is so I have

1026
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:35,200
so I have so you know when we're doing

1027
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:37,119
it this this is one more proof of that

1028
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,960
square root of two is a real number but

1029
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,559
this is sort of in a way how you think

1030
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,480
about it in terms of the uh decimals

1031
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,760
right

1032
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,160
and so we have this sequence a n and we

1033
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,680
have proven that it's converging to some

1034
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,640
a and we've shown that this a here has a

1035
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:00,000
property that is lesser a squ is lesser

1036
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:03,319
equal to true. So I want to prove so I

1037
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,319
want to show

1038
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,640
that a and

1039
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:15,839
that sorry that a squ is actually equal

1040
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,160
to not one but two right that's what I

1041
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:20,400
want to prove right and but I already

1042
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,880
proven that a squ is less or equal to

1043
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,880
two so enough

1044
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:31,480
to show

1045
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,480
that a squ is bigger = to

1046
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,799
okay so let's try to do that

1047
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:45,520
and I'm going to use this is going to be

1048
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:50,280
another illustration of the algebraic

1049
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,280
rules for sequences

1050
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:56,400
so

1051
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:58,160
I I haven't really I mean I I here now I

1052
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,520
really you know to prove

1053
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:05,839
that is less or equal to two. I didn't

1054
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:09,440
use fully the definition of the A

1055
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:12,559
because I didn't use I didn't really use

1056
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:15,599
that it was the largest such that A was

1057
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:21,559
defined in terms of BN where BN was the

1058
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,559
largest such uh such um

1059
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:28,319
such number

1060
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:31,520
and so if I'm looking at

1061
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:33,920
suppose now I'm looking at BN

1062
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:37,680
and I'm adding one

1063
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:42,319
and I'm squaring it. Right?

1064
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:46,079
Well, this here cannot also be smaller

1065
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:49,680
than this here because then then then

1066
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:52,079
the BN should have been this thing here,

1067
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:58,720
right? So, this here must actually be

1068
01:01:52,079 --> 01:02:00,400
strictly larger than 2 10 ^ 2nus 2.

1069
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,040
Okay.

1070
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,359
And so now you write,

1071
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:11,599
you know, you just divide by by this

1072
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:14,640
here on both sides. So you have b n + 1

1073
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:17,760
squared and you divide it by 10 to the

1074
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:20,559
power 2 n - 2. So you know that this

1075
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,520
thing is bigger than two.

1076
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:27,440
So now but you can write this in here.

1077
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:34,079
This denominator 10 ^ 2 nus 2 you can

1078
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:36,480
write as 10 ^ n -1 * 10 ^ n minus one.

1079
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:43,760
So in this way you can split this up and

1080
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:46,480
you can write it as bn + 1 over uh 10 ^

1081
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,480
n minus one

1082
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,760
and then times itself.

1083
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,359
This is is just to make sure that it's

1084
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,400
not

1085
01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:01,119
it's BN and then to the BN you're adding

1086
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,920
one.

1087
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,799
So like that

1088
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,839
you write like that.

1089
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:14,559
But you see this thing here, this is

1090
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:16,960
this here, this thing here. You can

1091
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,599
split the fraction up. You can write it

1092
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:23,920
as bn

1093
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:28,160
uh over 10 ^ n minus one. And then you

1094
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:30,240
can add 1 / 10 ^ nus1

1095
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,559
and then you can multiply that by

1096
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:35,559
itself. Right? You can write it like

1097
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,559
that.

1098
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:48,559
Right? But now now

1099
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,720
you see now I can write this in here

1100
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,480
as

1101
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,760
so now I can think about it in a

1102
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,240
slightly different way. So I have that.

1103
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,960
So so I can write this thing here. This

1104
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:04,240
thing here is just that is the

1105
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,920
definition of a n.

1106
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:09,760
Right?

1107
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:17,039
So I can say so what I have here is that

1108
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:19,520
a n + 1 / 10 ^ n minus one times itself

1109
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,839
but I'm I would just write it nicely out

1110
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,839
like this

1111
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,319
that this thing here remember the way

1112
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,480
the it go that this is equal to that

1113
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:34,079
which is bigger than one two so this

1114
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:38,799
here is bigger than two

1115
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:41,520
right Now 10 1 / 10 to the n you can

1116
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:43,359
think about that as a sequence right you

1117
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,039
can think about this as a sequence that

1118
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:49,760
sequence go to zero this here goes to a

1119
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,400
the sum of these two sequences by the

1120
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,280
algebraic rules go to the sum of the

1121
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:59,119
limits so this is a plus zero so that's

1122
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:02,160
a so this thing here goes to a and and

1123
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:05,359
this is the same so this goes to a so

1124
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,000
you see that the limit here then goes to

1125
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:11,680
by the product rule for the limits. The

1126
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,559
limit here is so you get that a squared

1127
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:17,359
here and since it holds for each element

1128
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,720
then it also holds for the limit right

1129
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,880
except you had to be a little bit

1130
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,640
careful it's may not be strict

1131
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:28,640
inequality but just big or equal to and

1132
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,079
of course in fact it is by equal to

1133
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:33,039
because now you have established the

1134
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,079
other inequality that a^2 was bigger

1135
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,799
equal to 2. We had already proven that

1136
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:42,480
a^2 was less or equal to two. So you

1137
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:44,799
conclude that a^2 is equal to two.

1138
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,119
If you kind of just think about it, this

1139
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:50,000
is really how it sounds maybe a little

1140
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:52,559
bit convoluted, but it's really kind of

1141
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,520
writing down precisely what you think

1142
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,359
about when you're singing about a square

1143
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:00,720
root of two because you think about the

1144
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:03,520
number of digits. And so if you take,

1145
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:07,839
you know, including the first the one in

1146
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:11,039
1.4 four B including that one. If you

1147
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:13,760
think about the number of digits

1148
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,799
like the A N then the A end is really

1149
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,640
defined if you were to make it precise

1150
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:23,079
you would define it in terms of this

1151
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,079
other sequence BN. Okay.

1152
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,720
Okay. So now the next thing is so this

1153
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,680
was just like

1154
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,839
a little illustration of how the mono

1155
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,680
convergence theorem worked.

1156
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:39,760
and and and and then and we this will

1157
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,559
you know play an important role next

1158
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:46,000
time we Yeah.

1159
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:47,440
>> So uh the reason why at the top we have

1160
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,119
like strictly greater than two and then

1161
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,400
at the bottom we have greater or equal

1162
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,079
to because the a and the a limits

1163
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,680
whereas on the top we're considering

1164
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,280
each element.

1165
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:00,559
>> So so this um the a

1166
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,880
this you were talking about this here

1167
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,520
right?

1168
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,440
>> Yeah.

1169
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,599
>> Yeah. So the a n converts to a right

1170
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,319
this here you I think about this here.

1171
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,079
So think about a sequence plus another

1172
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:15,359
sequence, right? This sequence here

1173
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:18,000
converts to zero, right? So the sum of

1174
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:19,839
these two sequences converts to zero.

1175
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,559
And likewise for this and then I'm

1176
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:26,240
thinking about it as a product of this

1177
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:29,760
sequence with that sequence. And so but

1178
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:32,559
but it's like each element is in that in

1179
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,480
this in the product sequence is strictly

1180
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,799
bigger than two. But it doesn't

1181
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,799
necessarily mean that the limit is

1182
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,559
strictly but the limit has to be bigger

1183
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,559
than two, right? Because they could kind

1184
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:45,119
of approach two and that's exactly what

1185
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,839
happened of course. Yeah.

1186
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,920
Uh okay. So and and so I also just want

1187
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:52,640
to say that this with lee soup and le

1188
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:56,319
mint well we didn't actually define it

1189
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:59,119
but I defined you know and this is it is

1190
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:01,520
how you defining but but we haven't

1191
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,000
talked about that concept yet but this I

1192
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,079
talked about with that if you take a

1193
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,599
boundary sequence then you could form

1194
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:12,000
two mono sequences this this will play a

1195
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,400
really important role for several things

1196
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,440
this is how one define the soup and the

1197
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:20,159
min haven't talked about those yet. It's

1198
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,199
also going to be used

1199
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:25,520
to prove an important theorem really

1200
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,520
important theorem and that's what and

1201
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,400
that I will talk about that theorem next

1202
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,960
but we won't prove it before next time.

1203
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,199
So what is what is that stuff going to

1204
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:39,520
be used

1205
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,839
and and and how does the monotone in

1206
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,359
what is another application and in fact

1207
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:46,400
there'll be several other applications

1208
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:50,000
of the monotone convergence theorem

1209
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,080
but so here is um here's a really

1210
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,319
important concept

1211
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:59,199
and so sometimes it's hard to you know

1212
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,520
in in if it was a monotom sequence then

1213
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:04,159
you could kind of write down explicitly

1214
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:07,120
what the limits were, right? And in all

1215
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:09,839
of the examples we saw so far, it was

1216
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:11,520
easy to write down the limits, but in

1217
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,199
general,

1218
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,040
you might not be able to write down the

1219
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:17,199
limits, but you want to prove that the

1220
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,159
limit exists. And so, this is the

1221
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:22,319
following notion that is then becomes

1222
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:25,799
really handy, and that's a notion of a

1223
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,799
cushy sequence.

1224
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:37,080
So what is a cushy sequence? So a cushi

1225
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:37,080
sequence. So it's a sequence a sequence

1226
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,560
with the property

1227
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:51,159
that

1228
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:51,159
for all

1229
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:59,120
epsilon greater than zero there exist

1230
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,560
n

1231
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,560
there exist a natural number n

1232
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,679
such that

1233
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,280
if n and m are bigger than this natural

1234
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,760
number

1235
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:18,080
then the

1236
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:21,120
two elements a n and and a m are less

1237
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:25,280
than epsilon apart.

1238
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:28,400
So like the so this is a different

1239
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:31,280
notion than convergence. Convergence

1240
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,960
say that if you that a sequence is

1241
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:38,640
convergent if everything kind of far out

1242
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:42,800
accumulates around the limit. Right?

1243
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:46,159
This here say that that and

1244
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,880
and of course it will. So this has say

1245
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:52,080
that if you that a cushie sequence

1246
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,640
that's a sequence so that if you are far

1247
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,840
out then syncs a bunch together

1248
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:05,080
basically right now of course we will

1249
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:05,080
prove and so we prove for the on r

1250
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,440
we will prove that the cy sequence

1251
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,320
so we prove

1252
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:19,920
that

1253
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:22,000
so we prove the following

1254
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,480
um

1255
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,159
put for

1256
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:32,480
that that's on R but everything is on R

1257
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:35,480
at the moment uh that any that a

1258
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,480
sequence

1259
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,159
is a cushy sequence

1260
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:47,960
sequence

1261
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,960
if and only if

1262
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:55,400
only if it is

1263
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,400
convergent.

1264
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:01,040
Okay, I won't prove this now but but

1265
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,840
I'll prove this next time

1266
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:07,440
and and again the proof of this involve

1267
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,640
this stuff with we define these two

1268
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:14,880
sequences from a bounded sequence. So it

1269
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:20,239
it would be useful there. Um

1270
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:25,199
uh now let me give you some examples. Um

1271
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:28,640
so one uh one uh

1272
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:32,719
one um example and the thing is that

1273
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:35,920
that and we'll get to that later but as

1274
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:38,400
at the moment we talk everything is in R

1275
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:41,600
and then we will later generalize this

1276
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:45,360
right and so to generalize this a lot of

1277
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:49,440
these concepts work much more general

1278
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:52,480
and and that's extremely useful and Um

1279
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:55,679
and it can be used to

1280
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,480
find solutions to differential equations

1281
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:02,480
but uh and but then you have to abstract

1282
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:04,640
these concepts. So uh to where sequences

1283
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,480
are not anymore real numbers but they

1284
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,280
are of some other space and then you

1285
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:13,040
have to talk about convergence etc.

1286
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:15,840
And so you can use this to to define um

1287
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,920
solutions to def to show that various

1288
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,280
differential equations

1289
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,320
uh have solutions. Okay. And so that

1290
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:28,440
often goes over using what's called the

1291
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,440
contracting mapping the

1292
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,120
mapping.

1293
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,760
and and the contracting mappings

1294
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:48,159
theorem, you know, have all kind of

1295
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:51,280
forms and uh the but they're all, you

1296
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:54,719
know, it's just a matter of what space

1297
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:57,199
you're looking at and and so on. Uh but

1298
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:59,360
so we're looking at R here in this case.

1299
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:02,159
And so the contracting mapping theorem,

1300
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:05,920
that's a map is just a it's just a map

1301
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:08,880
here now from R to R.

1302
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:13,280
And that the map is contracting means

1303
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:16,080
that if you take two elements

1304
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:18,800
uh in

1305
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:21,199
uh so it means that sorry T is a

1306
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:25,480
contracting map

1307
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:25,480
is a contracting map

1308
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,370
[Music]

1309
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,569
if they exist.

1310
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:34,569
[Applause]

1311
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,840
And this is really important. C is is

1312
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,760
positive. I mean that's not important.

1313
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,040
It sort of had to be positive. So that's

1314
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,360
but the the the important point is that

1315
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,400
C has to be strictly less than one. That

1316
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:53,840
that's a crucial point.

1317
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:57,199
Um and then it then it has a property

1318
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:02,719
that when you apply when you take X and

1319
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:05,920
Y in this in R and you're looking at the

1320
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:10,080
how close X and Y are together. So the

1321
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:14,960
how close that the image

1322
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:16,560
uh under t of x and y how close they are

1323
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,360
together

1324
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:24,760
then those have to be some factor and

1325
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,760
this is the factor the c is the factor

1326
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,120
and that has so they have to come

1327
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,199
closer. This is why c have to be

1328
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,080
strictly less than one because they have

1329
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:37,520
to come closer. If they come closer by a

1330
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:40,000
factor than the original one was then

1331
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:43,600
then so the contracting mapping theorem

1332
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,600
say so this is a contracting map sorry

1333
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:51,120
so a contracting map is a map from R to

1334
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,920
R so that there exists some constant

1335
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:57,280
strictly less than one so that for all X

1336
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:00,719
and Y you have that the difference

1337
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:03,280
between the images is this factor that

1338
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,120
is strictly less than on with what they

1339
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,960
were originally

1340
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,480
and so now you get the contracting

1341
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,199
mapping theorem and we'll talk about the

1342
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,880
proof next time and and again this you

1343
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,360
know

1344
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,400
you know once you have know the more

1345
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:20,239
abstract concepts then it's quite easy I

1346
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,960
mean the proof is going to be the same

1347
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:24,480
etc etc and will give you existence of

1348
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,800
solutions to a lot of differential

1349
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,360
equation so this is the contracting

1350
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,360
mapping term

1351
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:47,400
So it say the following that if

1352
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:47,400
uh t from r to r

1353
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,400
is a contracting

1354
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,280
Then

1355
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:07,080
then C

1356
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,080
has a fixed point.

1357
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,440
It has a fixed point.

1358
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:22,000
And this means that t of x is equal to

1359
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:23,920
x. And when you apply this theorem,

1360
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,520
the contract. So this is the contracting

1361
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:30,719
mapping. And again, it's crucial that

1362
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:33,360
this C is less than one. That's what

1363
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,440
makes everything go. If it's if it was

1364
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,199
equal to one, you wouldn't get anything.

1365
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,640
Okay? It has to be strictly less than

1366
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:41,120
one.

1367
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,760
And this thing here, if you set it up

1368
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,600
more generally, you know, if the spaces

1369
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,199
are more general than just the real

1370
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:51,679
numbers, then then this here will be

1371
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:53,520
that you have a solution. It it could be

1372
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,080
it can be applied to many other things,

1373
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,840
but it could be that you have a solution

1374
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,640
to a differential equation. This

1375
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,840
statement here, you know, is like a

1376
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,760
standard application to get solutions to

1377
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:09,120
differential equations and you know, you

1378
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:11,840
can do use for all kind of stuff. Okay.

1379
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:16,080
And so uh so we'll talk about that next

1380
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:18,080
time. Uh and not maybe not the the the I

1381
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,920
talk about the contracting mapping the

1382
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,080
won't talk quite yet about the

1383
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,120
applications.

1384
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:28,600
Any questions?

1385
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,600
Okay. Great.
