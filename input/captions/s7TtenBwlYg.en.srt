1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,879
I didn't get any new topics that people

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,680
wanted uh throughout the day so I'm

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,560
going to go through some topics that

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,039
people have uh T talk asked about

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,320
earlier in this semester and um that I

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,840
think are are kind of fun and so they're

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,519
sort of the the most fun things that

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,640
from my perspective maybe I have a six

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,520
sense of fun uh that that we didn't

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,320
fully cover so one of the first things I

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,840
want to talk about is a cool little

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,640
two-part um uh you what do you call this

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,079
a fable a moral uh moral story um that

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
has a little conclusion at the end and

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
something called Gap fill I'm pretty

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,879
sure I've talked about this a couple

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
times in different places but I'm pretty

18
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,559
sure I did not do this this semester did

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,359
I no good good okay because there

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,239
there's three points in the semester

21
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,320
where this could have gone one is

22
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,640
anytime we started talking about David

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,280
Hon's work um and this is one of the

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,799
very cool papers he's the second author

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,400
Paul Von hipple a very uh very well

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,840
established uh scholar and of Music

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,040
perception and cognition um did this

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,520
study in around fall 2000 published in

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Fall 2000 so it's about uh 25 year 25

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,159
years since they did this and it's a one

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,759
of these really cool things that got me

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
into this field U so when I heard about

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,119
this I was like this is why I want to

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,399
use computers to do things so um has

35
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,280
anybody ever uh you all have some

36
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,399
encounter with species Counterpoint

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,600
because you did uh you read the um the

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,399
David Luen article on an interesting

39
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,759
Global rule for Counterpoint so it's

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,399
dealing with sort of 16th century

41
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,600
musical style and how we can recreate it

42
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,960
and one of the rules that I was taught

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,799
when I learned uh species Counterpoint

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,799
is that if you take a big leap and you

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,600
go up you've created a gap and the most

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,520
natural thing for your musical line to

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,120
do is to go down after that fill in the

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,080
Gap Gap fill uh some people spell it as

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,560
one word some hyphen some as space it

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,440
doesn't I don't really care Gap fill

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,680
similarly you leap down a lot and you

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,440
should go

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:29,680
up and um so I immediately looked at um

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,519
a piece by Giovani palestrina uh one of

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,519
the most important composers in this

56
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,800
period that species Counterpoint is

57
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:41,920
based on uh around 1550 1570 or so um

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,560
this is part of one of his masses and um

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,959
here's the score you see it but I've

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,680
also kind of colored things in that uh

61
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,680
green notes are upward leaps that need a

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,440
downward um thing after it so um things

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
and then the Blue Notes a downward leap

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,959
that needs an upward motion and all

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,239
around here it's all stepwise so it can

66
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,640
go any direction it wants so if Gap fill

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,239
exists then then uh and every time

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,080
there's Gap fill fulfilled every time it

69
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,640
works there's um a little uh pink or

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,440
Peach Dot and every time it's not

71
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,440
there's a big yellow Dot and you can see

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,270
there are no yellow dots up there so

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:26,760
this is what this sounds

74
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,840
[Music]

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,730
like do that one more time so you can

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:46,280
hear it

77
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:47,680
[Music]

78
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,720
I just had to add the last note

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,079
otherwise it'd be kind of out there um

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,120
so Gap fill seems to be a thing

81
00:03:53,079 --> 00:04:00,879
composers do this but um the really cool

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,400
thing that uh that hippo Von hippo and

83
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,840
hiron did was that they realized that

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,120
there's two things happening when you

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,360
leap up a lot one is you've you've

86
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,120
created a big leap right the other is

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,120
that you're higher in your voice

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,600
range so

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:30,080
um if if I'm down here and I leap up and

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,320
then I leap up then I Le up you guys are

91
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,160
going to bet that eventually I'm going

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,199
to come down right yeah uh you can't

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,080
really go up forever and so what they

94
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,680
were wondering is does it have to do the

95
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,320
fact that eventually when you get really

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
high the only place to go is down

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,039
especially if you're talking about vocal

98
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
music or well I mean even on a piano

99
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,479
eventually you got to come down so they

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,039
looked at um what the median what the

101
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,720
average pitch across a whole piece was

102
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,440
and marked it as specific and then

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,520
thought that hey there's um there's four

104
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:10,320
kinds of leaps and can't um there's ones

105
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,240
that start at or above the median and go

106
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,479
even higher that's when I was doing this

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,080
and I yeah up there then there's ones

108
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,039
that start below the median and go above

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,160
it there's ones that start below and

110
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,080
reach the median and then like I started

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,080
the ones that start below and after they

112
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,280
leap up they're still pretty low so

113
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,039
there's still below the

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
median and

115
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,680
that there might be something besides

116
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,919
Gap fill that explains things for

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,039
instance let's say you bought two

118
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:48,360
domestic continental US

119
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:51,880
flights first you flow from San

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Francisco to New York City now you have

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,199
another

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,960
flight just take a guess uh you've gone

123
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,680
from well instead of up and down we'll

124
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,080
say west east you've gone from west to a

125
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,199
big thing on the East and now you board

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,880
let's say a random flight after this

127
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,840
it's it's pre 911 you could just board

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,919
random flights you all don't remember

129
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400
that World um

130
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,280
so what do you which direction do you

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,720
think you're likely to go you you're not

132
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,960
in the international section west or

133
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,720
east west west why because there's so

134
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,520
many more options of going west from New

135
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,360
York than there are from um

136
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,599
yeah then there are East I guess we

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,440
that's that's a little too far for

138
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,120
Portland I mean but yeah you can kind of

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,800
get the picture um and so if

140
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,000
you're if you're already above the

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,680
median you have a lot more choices going

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,560
down than up and what they

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,759
predicted was that um a lot of these

144
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,120
things would happen even by chance that

145
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:04,199
if you went um if you you jumped up up

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,479
above from a normal note and and you big

147
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,759
do a big J Jump Up you're probably above

148
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,479
the median and you're going to Gap fill

149
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:17,000
just by the concept of regression to the

150
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:19,919
mean and so I went and um took that

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,560
exact same piece from uh pal I guess

152
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,879
I've been doing the same thing I did

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,840
with a bcde e f for a long time of just

154
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,919
taking pieces and scrambling them

155
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,199
remember when we were doing the

156
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,759
similarity one I just scrambled all the

157
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,759
notes so here's the exact same Melody

158
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:52,250
[Music]

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,720
scrambled and again everything that that

160
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,800
demands by the theory of Gap fill Motion

161
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,800
in the opposite direction than where it

162
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,520
just came I've marked um with a green or

163
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,000
blue and I've marked with peach when it

164
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,039
works I've marked with a big yellow dot

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,159
when it doesn't and in this scrambled

166
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,560
and this was the first random run I did

167
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,639
I didn't run it a whole bunch of times

168
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,759
until I got one that worked it works

169
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,759
perfectly so there what they argued was

170
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,960
that this concept of Gap fill as

171
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,200
something un in music could actually

172
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,080
just be explained by regression to the

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,680
mean and I thought this is really really

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,919
cool um the thing I noticed looking at

175
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,200
this article for the first time you uh

176
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,320
in the mid what do you call them the a

177
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,600
the 2000 to 2009 something was looking

178
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,560
at the data that they had um to do this

179
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,600
and so they had um some uh songs Leader

180
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,800
by Schubert they had European folk songs

181
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,079
where do you think that came from from

182
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,839
anybody European folk songs and Chinese

183
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,240
folk songs that's always that's the ESS

184
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,040
in data set so they had this data sets

185
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
been around for a while and they had

186
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,399
some other things South African and obj

187
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,760
uh Native American folk songs and um you

188
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,079
can kind of see when uh when you're

189
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,880
going all the you're already high and

190
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,760
you go even higher then the odds are

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,600
you're going to turn down when you're

192
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,800
here you you're going to come back down

193
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,800
right and so that's very statically

194
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,120
significant and when you start in a

195
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,920
normal range and end in a high range

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,279
you're still probably going to go down

197
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,120
and they saw that a lot this is not just

198
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
down this is other direction but I'll

199
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,079
assume for a second that everything is

200
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,320
leaping up but then when you get right

201
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,920
to the median you kind of see that you

202
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:54,720
go about 5050 in either direction and

203
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,640
when you um when you start low and you

204
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,120
go up but you're still

205
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,200
low the that um more often than not you

206
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
just continue going up there is no Gap

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,920
fill or or it's kind of reverse Gap fill

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,800
or some something like that um so I'm

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,880
you know somebody uh developing music 21

210
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,680
and I I kind of look at these numbers

211
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,959
which are probably from like 1998 or

212
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,720
something now it's 2010 2012 I'm

213
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,600
teaching here doing this type of stuff

214
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,959
and I look at their sample size they

215
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,360
have you know 60 86 examples of

216
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,279
something like this and 101 of something

217
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,399
else because it took a long time to

218
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,120
encode music then it still takes a long

219
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,959
time but we've gotten things better

220
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,920
there's more data sets out there so I

221
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,880
thought about running it for um think it

222
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,519
was originally to think of as a problem

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,600
set for this class to to you know let's

224
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,880
validate Von hipple and Hon's work um

225
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,200
but it turned into a little bit more and

226
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,560
it turned into uh a paper that my friend

227
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,399
Mark who's probably going to watch this

228
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,839
at some point we do still need to finish

229
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,760
publishing it we've presented it many

230
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,560
times but

231
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,240
published uh species or species on

232
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,880
various rules for species Counterpoint

233
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,120
that uh don't seem to actually exist in

234
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,920
the literature uh

235
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,839
because when we ran the same thing you

236
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,560
can see we have a a lot more data

237
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,519
examples and when we looked at the

238
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,639
Chinese folk songs we also saw the same

239
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,000
thing that Von hipple and hiron did that

240
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,720
there is a lot more evidence for R to

241
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,200
the mean regression to the mean than

242
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,480
there is for Gap Phill and when uh we

243
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,240
looked at the European Essen data set we

244
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,480
still saw the same thing and all these

245
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,560
things so um I get got to do the nice

246
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,040
validation study that I thought we would

247
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,920
do and I thought would' make a nice

248
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,120
assignment for us all and everything

249
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,279
until I looked at um music before Bach

250
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,839
the music of the era that we do species

251
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,800
Counterpoint on why we have species

252
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,440
Counterpoint exercises and it turned out

253
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,839
there that for these uh weird pieces

254
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,760
where you're jumping up above the mean

255
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,480
or something like that that Gap fill

256
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,200
happens more often than regression to

257
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,040
the

258
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,720
mean and so for these like low going to

259
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,279
here and then you would expect

260
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,959
regression to mean you should still go

261
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,800
up there did seem to be a period where

262
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,000
people were actually doing Gap fill and

263
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,519
so that was was pretty uh was pretty

264
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,199
neat and um so it just shows that

265
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,240
sometimes and you get a new data set you

266
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,360
should be

267
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,480
reexamining existing

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,720
theories um but Von hipple and hon did

269
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,959
cover their butts at the end they said

270
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,079
that their conclusion and I agree with

271
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,720
them completely so so they are actually

272
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,560
and I are actually in agreement on this

273
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
that their conclusion applied only to

274
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,800
the sampled vocal repertories that they

275
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,519
were looking at um that that other

276
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,399
repertories may contain an excess of

277
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,199
post skip reversals Gap fill uh given

278
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,000
the centuries of Western composers who

279
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,880
have been taught to write Gap fill it

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
seems inevitable that some of them have

281
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,639
actually done it in their compositions

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,480
and now we can kind of see what eras

283
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,560
composers were actually doing it though

284
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,600
I I think it's kind of interesting that

285
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:21,240
the era that um started teaching how to

286
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,959
write music with gapville is closer to

287
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,279
this period to Bach Mozart and

288
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,519
everything talking about how music of

289
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,120
that past worked so they weren't

290
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,240
actually doing it in their own music but

291
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,360
they had observed something um in the

292
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,399
past and just shows for the 10 millionth

293
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,920
time when we think we're Smarter Than

294
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,920
People of the past were quite often

295
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,839
wrong questions on Gap fill or this kind

296
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,240
of work or or discussion points doesn't

297
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,240
have to be a

298
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,360
question cool eh do it again somewh

299
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,639
something between yeah um can you talk a

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,560
little bit through the numbers like what

301
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,399
yeah what exactly does like how do you

302
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,920
measure significance exactly yeah I

303
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,440
can't I can't remember this is why I

304
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,360
needs a little bit of time to come back

305
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,079
to this how did this I think it was the

306
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,079
um uh Scholars T Test um do you know

307
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,480
what that is what the significance

308
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:27,920
basically how far is this difference

309
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,920
between these two things um how far is

310
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,639
it compared to random chance so one of

311
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,639
the one of the things that um it doesn't

312
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,720
work this isn't a statistics class and I

313
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,320
am not a professional statistician but

314
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,560
um but one of the ways you can often

315
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,279
test something is U if your null

316
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,920
hypothesis if your hypothesis going into

317
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,360
experiment is that um you know that Gap

318
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,880
fill doesn't exist that there shouldn't

319
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,560
be a difference between a gap fill and a

320
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,720
random motion or motion toward the the

321
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,480
um toward the mediant regression should

322
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,240
say regression to mediant I suppose than

323
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,120
to mean but we don't know that and so

324
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,079
one of the things is that

325
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,600
significance goes um the amount of

326
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,519
difference between two hypotheses

327
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:23,440
necessary to say that something is

328
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,839
highly significant goes up uh the the

329
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,319
amount of difference in percentage uh

330
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:33,560
goes down a lot as the number of

331
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:36,000
observations goes way way up um and one

332
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,560
of the places I saw this on was on uh

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,759
the article I wrote with Sophia sun on

334
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,120
the lyrics uh emphasis you know like uh

335
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,399
various are there high notes on

336
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,399
anticipation or surprise when you when

337
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,759
we're talking about oh anticipation is

338
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,720
higher than discusted we're talking

339
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,360
about an average I think those two were

340
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,759
about one semitone the difference

341
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,440
between F and FP this is not a huge

342
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,480
difference but when you get um you know

343
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,639
880,000 or I suppose that one was around

344
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,880
10,000 observations one semitone starts

345
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:13,880
becoming pretty significant um so that's

346
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,240
one of the ways that sometimes you can

347
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,240
um if you look at if you're just looking

348
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,440
at like 10 pieces you might see that

349
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,279
well six of them do this and four of

350
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,040
them do the other thing that's probably

351
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,319
not going to be a significant difference

352
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,079
because if you flip a coin 10 times you

353
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,199
might get sick heads and four tails or

354
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,480
something um

355
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,199
yeah the numbers for Gap fill and

356
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,600
regression so I guess the median those

357
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,720
are instances where this happens in the

358
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,880
pieces of that specific um sometimes can

359
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,639
it do both I guess like if if it starts

360
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,800
above the above R median it will

361
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,519
technically be both if it just goes down

362
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,759
right yes so you can okay but some of

363
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,399
them are one or the other right and and

364
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,759
so the ones that cross over um I think

365
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:04,679
it's only the ones that reach to the

366
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,439
median or that don't reach it that end

367
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,679
up having um being in the observation

368
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,039
set okay because all the rest should

369
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,120
always be the um should always be the

370
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,799
same they should be the same the whether

371
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,280
uh that is to say if if you

372
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:26,640
start if you start middle or start

373
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,880
middle high and go really high and then

374
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,960
you go even higher well then you've

375
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,160
broken Gap fill and broken regression to

376
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,200
the mean and if you go down then you

377
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,679
fulfilled Gap fill and regression to the

378
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
mean so you haven't learned anything

379
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:43,440
about your hypothesis so I think these

380
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,400
were um only very um various these um

381
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,240
particular cases where the two

382
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,080
hypotheses would res uh result in

383
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,320
different directions

384
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,840
predicted yeah great question great

385
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,000
question now we're getting on I just

386
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,840
need to give more time

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,840
any other things

388
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,559
this isn't a statistics class so I'm not

389
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,000
going to go into um things like this but

390
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,880
there one of the one of the mistakes

391
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,320
that people who dabble in statistics uh

392
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,440
but whose main work is on Medieval music

393
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,039
music theory programming all these other

394
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,679
things we often get wrong is uh

395
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,240
something called a multiple comparison

396
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:27,320
test and that is to say the more if I

397
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,039
did looked at you know 7,000 repertories

398
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,799
and I'm only reporting the top 10 or the

399
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,200
10 best or something like that um then

400
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,919
my significance level needs to be much

401
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,360
much much higher and sort of general

402
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,880
rule if is if um who's heard of like P

403
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,520
value 05 or 5% yeah as sort of a

404
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,039
standard thing so if you look at five

405
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,080
different things in uh you know five

406
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,000
different hypotheses start with a P

407
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,799
value instead of 05 divide that by five

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
is

409
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:03,320
01 um and so this was uh a criticism on

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,120
some of the um some earlier work that I

411
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,720
did where I was looking at you know

412
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,600
there's uh what is it 10 different um 10

413
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,840
different emotions or sentiments that

414
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,520
can be compared with nine other ones so

415
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,640
I'm doing 90 comparisons for each uh

416
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,360
attribute so I should be whatever 05

417
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,039
divided by 90 is some somewhere around

418
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,159
01 we just looked at the number of zeros

419
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,080
compared to the number of of hypotheses

420
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,440
um yeah so so look out for things where

421
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,520
people are reporting

422
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,200
p

423
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,799
046 as significant because it's lower

424
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,679
than 05 but not not very much but on the

425
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:47,240
other hand when you get something like e

426
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,480
to the 45 you have 45 zeros before some

427
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,559
digit that I don't even care what the

428
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,480
digit is there's 45 zeros and that's

429
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,240
what's important um that ends up being

430
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,520
pretty good I like that the um European

431
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,039
folk song we can actually do even better

432
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,440
than um than uh you know they were

433
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,960
giving two two stars for um for their

434
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,520
work because they only had this many

435
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,559
observations um but now we can give them

436
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,120
a lot more observations and say yeah

437
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,320
this is absolutely right um one once you

438
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,000
get uh in 64-bit numbers once you get uh

439
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,159
more than 308 zeros it just gets rounded

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,080
to zero which uh ends up being a lot of

441
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:33,400
zero division errors cool

442
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,080
I'm going to move on to the second um

443
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,000
second topic uh a little bit briefly and

444
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,159
it's something I feel I rightly should

445
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
feel apologetic for um we're moving into

446
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,600
an era where uh where we where where

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
people here in New England in Boston at

448
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,600
MIT in the United States are recognizing

449
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,679
finally that Western Europe is not the

450
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,000
only place that does music or culture I

451
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,960
know big big big shock so why has this

452
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,039
class been primarily about western music

453
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:11,760
in fact we can start um looking at other

454
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,679
music as part of a music theory class

455
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,880
there was just earlier this semester I

456
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,760
think I emailed it to somebody it might

457
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,679
have been Vincent even who just came

458
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,919
came in um some maybe sure a new book

459
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,760
that just came out it's I think it's

460
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:29,080
like 600 Pages all on

461
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,799
computational approaches to Indian art

462
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,640
music uh that's say um music that's

463
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,440
that's sort of in a high tradition that

464
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,520
is not folk music or modern popular

465
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,080
music and if you think about you or

466
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,120
Bollywood or something like that if you

467
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,720
think about if you can write 600 pages

468
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,880
on Indian art music you could probably

469
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,440
write 600 pages on computational

470
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,120
approaches to any of those things too um

471
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,480
and I'm really looking forward to seeing

472
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,679
uh what one of my colleagues uh down in

473
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,080
the um in South South as are doing but

474
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:06,120
uh one of the things that's comes up

475
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,919
here oh no I didn't highlight this is

476
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:13,440
that most of my training my personal

477
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,000
blinders I I'll say bias my although

478
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,960
maybe it is also that has been that I

479
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,919
was always interested in musical scores

480
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,200
and now there's large parts of music

481
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,640
theory that are interested in things

482
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,880
that are not score-based and most of the

483
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,440
rest of the world's music is not

484
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,720
primarily score based just as shockingly

485
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,679
most um most western music today is not

486
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,200
primarily score based I mean it is

487
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,000
really really great when you go see your

488
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,159
favorite uh heavy metal band and they're

489
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,840
all page turning for each other so no no

490
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,320
that doesn't happen we're you know we're

491
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,320
much more of an oral culture today so

492
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,600
yeah so it says basically that um there

493
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,200
are no standardized tools yet such as

494
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,799
hum drum or music 21 for Indian art

495
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,919
music scores and that still get need

496
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,440
Collections and of scores whatever it is

497
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,600
if we're going to be using these tools

498
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,559
and I want us to always be trying to

499
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,520
break out of the chicken and egg problem

500
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,039
that I've done this semester with you

501
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,640
we'll do another Buck cow I I really my

502
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:17,200
apology to you all everybody is that I

503
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,080
wanted to deemphasize more of those

504
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,720
things and music 21 Version 9 has a

505
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,400
bunch of other substitute scores that

506
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,200
are designed for us to be using and uh

507
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
it's just has continued to be too buggy

508
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
to recommend for us all to use in this

509
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,120
class not the scores the surrounding

510
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,919
code um so we don't want the chicken and

511
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,760
egg problem that well we don't study

512
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,880
this music because there aren't enough

513
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,120
scores in there well why don't we encode

514
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,200
a whole bunch of scores well if we did

515
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,559
that there's no software to analyze it

516
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,000
right so these are some of the problems

517
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,240
that are there um so um they're

518
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,400
absolutely WR that these tools the

519
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,000
authors of this book editors that these

520
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,559
tools don't yet exist um

521
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,360
but we wanted to those of us who are

522
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,559
building music 21 first and many of us

523
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,840
in scores we just never got there this

524
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,880
is um one of the slides I know I haven't

525
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,320
changed my font in a long time um from

526
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,679
the original funding presentation to get

527
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,159
funding to take music 21 from a little

528
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,919
hobby europ project and to make it a

529
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,440
bigger one and we talked about these are

530
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,080
probably things doesn't exactly work

531
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,039
like this but you know these were the

532
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,600
types of things music 21 was going to be

533
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,640
able to do generic intervals specific

534
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,360
chromatic is Step you all have worked

535
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,399
with this by now um but then I thought

536
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,159
well you should be able to apply a

537
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:44,520
context to any object and transform how

538
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:48,640
that object Works uh so you could apply

539
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:51,559
13th century France con uh con oh I

540
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,600
didn't even make this consistent in the

541
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:55,880
um you this is all pseudo code in 13th

542
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,840
century France this major third would

543
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,120
not be called a consonant only perfect

544
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,440
intervals that's why they're called

545
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,039
perfect or consonantes in fact this

546
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,480
lower note wouldn't even exist there is

547
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,960
no a flat back then so we could do that

548
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,159
and then we could apply other things

549
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,080
like 20th century Harmony apply an

550
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,640
octatonic scale and count the number of

551
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,760
um notes in this and we' get three

552
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,120
instead of two and that one we can kind

553
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,760
of do but I did think about oh wouldn't

554
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,399
it be great to be able to take this

555
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,520
interval which we started with calling

556
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,520
it major 3D and convert it into the

557
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,600
Indian farara and get seven shuti as the

558
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:36,399
interval that these types of things

559
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,200
should be able to be done and a lot of

560
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,760
the basic design decisions some of the

561
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,559
things are over complicated in what

562
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,200
you're trying to do were in order to

563
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:49,840
enable more of these U things or that um

564
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,679
we can apply an IND okan pentatonic

565
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,640
scale and say the a flat to C is a step

566
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,600
it is not a skip is a leap because there

567
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:03,000
is no note between those

568
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,919
um or one of the last things in there

569
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,120
that um you know one of the things music

570
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,200
21 will be able to answer um I suppose I

571
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,559
never put a timeline on that so maybe

572
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,720
I'm still uh telling the truth you know

573
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,720
is that West African cultures often hear

574
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,520
the same rhythmic pattern and as having

575
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,760
different strong beats different parts

576
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,200
of the Bell pattern um what can we learn

577
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,799
from analyzing more music to try to

578
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,159
figure out what Clues give uh different

579
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:37,039
of um of strong beat among different

580
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:39,440
listeners so these are all ideas that

581
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,000
computational music theory should be

582
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
able to

583
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,679
do so we wanted to get there originally

584
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,360
a whole field has wanted to get there uh

585
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:55,000
to be able to do some of these things

586
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:58,559
but we're not there yet to really have

587
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,559
cross-cultural symbolic music um an

588
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,559
analysis but I want to keep trying I'm

589
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,760
going to be

590
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,200
spending this is a summer coming up for

591
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,799
me I'm going to be trying to this has

592
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:15,240
really inspired me to make sure that at

593
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,240
least one more of these things are

594
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,760
possible so that's that's one more the

595
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,480
second of three things I wanted to talk

596
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,640
about today um discussion ideas anybody

597
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,480
know of anything very cool happening in

598
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,640
this sort of

599
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,840
world oh I meant to talk about there is

600
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,720
a project taros that um is specifically

601
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,960
a music theory uh toolkit for looking at

602
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,120
music throughout the world it's a little

603
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,240
bit um uh older it's one of these things

604
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,960
that you need to find your Java virtual

605
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,279
machine to work uh properly on but it's

606
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,279
very cool set um of tools for uh for

607
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,760
analyzing especially scales and scale

608
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,159
usage through the world that doesn't re

609
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,080
that doesn't rely on saying oh well that

610
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,320
not's kind of like an A and that notes a

611
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,440
c but 20 cents high no no those are

612
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,720
notes these are not alterations on some

613
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,760
you know platonic correct note that just

614
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,880
happens to be the Western scale so I

615
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,360
think any conceptual system for

616
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,279
nonwestern music needs to start with

617
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,960
anything that is fundamental in that

618
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,880
system is a fundamental object that

619
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,440
maybe we can translate them to um to

620
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,519
other systems objects like western music

621
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,279
but first the manipulation should happen

622
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,279
in the space that people are actually

623
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,440
conceiving I know it's very B leury

624
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,640
today for me but

625
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,480
um I don't want you to have to do too

626
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,399
much more work while you're doing many

627
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,519
other things so I'm going to talk about

628
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,120
um the last really cool area that I

629
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,640
think there's still so much for music

630
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,240
theory to be doing in order order to get

631
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,480
us more scores and that is improving

632
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,279
Optical music recognition so Optical

633
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,279
music recognition process of changing a

634
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,840
musical score into something that a

635
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,320
computer can understand a symbolic score

636
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,840
and this is uh done what is my name

637
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,600
bigger on this I think we reset the that

638
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,120
that is not supposed to happen I think

639
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,200
there was something I think it was in an

640
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:27,320
auto shrink um uh mode sorry about that

641
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:31,640
sorry Mara uh doing amazing things out

642
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,600
there at du lingo um okay um one of the

643
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,640
opportunities is and this is from a

644
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,880
presentation I'm reusing slides I don't

645
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,960
update them every year uh because from

646
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,519
2014 um

647
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,559
that um that back when imslp had about

648
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,880
300,000 scores I think it's over double

649
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,919
that now and so we'd love to be able to

650
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,480
convert all of them into music so I

651
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,640
always you know might as well start with

652
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,799
AA Klein KN music by wolf amas Mozart

653
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,320
late 19th

654
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,480
century and so if we want to convert it

655
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,600
over this is um use from the

656
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,440
state-of-the-art in 2014 it's gotten

657
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,360
better but not a huge amount better so

658
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,799
this is the original score of of one

659
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,440
part and this is what the optical music

660
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,440
recognition score came up with so you

661
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,960
can see uh oops we've lost lost some

662
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,880
notes Here uh somehow we have another

663
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,240
rest here and a whole bunch of dots at

664
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,320
the top and on the other hand you know a

665
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,519
lot of it looks kind of kind of right

666
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,960
but how do these errors add up

667
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,320
especially rhythmic errors um and

668
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,279
misidentified part names cffs can lead

669
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,559
to Big differences in perception so I'm

670
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,679
just going to remind us for the first

671
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:51,960
couple bars of what I CL music knock

672
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,799
music should sound like this is actually

673
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,159
it shouldn't sound like this this is a

674
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,919
un unretouched finale performance from

675
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,919
um music EX

676
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,639
okay y'all recognize it good so I don't

677
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,679
need to play more let's listen to a

678
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,799
little bit of what happens when you play

679
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,850
back the state-of-the-art optical music

680
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:51,960
recognition

681
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:54,960
[Music]

682
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,960
oh

683
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,639
I have no idea how it got what

684
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,440
instruments should be

685
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:06,600
playing

686
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,919
anyhow so one of the things I've been

687
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,240
talking about especially since our sound

688
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,320
discore lecture we didn't really do uh

689
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,799
uh image discore lecture uh is how music

690
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,200
theory knowledge can um work with

691
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,880
inaccuracies in omr fortunately some

692
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,120
other people have been thinking about it

693
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,440
this is one um I should be citing my

694
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,519
sources I can't uh remember exactly

695
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,080
where it came from one uh pipeline for

696
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,120
how scanned music can end up as a music

697
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,799
encoded data file staff line DET

698
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,159
identification object location so on but

699
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,639
uh just like we saw in the sound of

700
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,080
score things musical semantics and

701
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:48,639
musical knowledge can be used to go back

702
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,120
and forth in sort of a two-way Pipeline

703
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,159
and that was the idea that almost

704
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:58,159
everybody knew but but very few musical

705
00:32:53,159 --> 00:33:02,039
semantics have been brought in to um uh

706
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,519
to to what we're uh doing so here's some

707
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,519
things that errors that music theory can

708
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,559
fix um you might have a pitch out of

709
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,679
context and would figure out what we

710
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,080
have

711
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,120
misread probably that was intended to be

712
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,840
a sharp and now it's been read as a

713
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,399
natural instrument or cleff

714
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,919
misidentification I mean this is

715
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,559
something that you don't need very much

716
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,399
programming to figure out Uh something's

717
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,760
wrong

718
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,600
the correction isn't necessarily the

719
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,880
easiest thing should it be uh change

720
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,919
that to a tuba or change the cluff to um

721
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,960
to a treble cluff not sure but we can

722
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,039
definitely point that out if we have

723
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,440
music theory knowledge um to point

724
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,840
something in um and then metrical

725
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,360
inconsistencies is what we focused on

726
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,320
because metrical inconsistencies have a

727
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,559
really really nice thing that pitch

728
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,840
inconsistencies don't there's um there's

729
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,159
no answer key to whether you do it right

730
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,919
or wrong but there is a check sum to

731
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,000
check see if you've probably got it

732
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,760
right or probably got it wrong and that

733
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,040
is the time

734
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,560
signature when everything that you've

735
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,159
recognized does not add up to the time

736
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,000
signature maybe it's a pickup bar maybe

737
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,320
it's some other weird thing but most of

738
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,879
the time you've gotten something wrong

739
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:27,440
right so um we want to talk about um the

740
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,280
Rhythm replacement and what we're doing

741
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,760
all

742
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,399
has begins with the assumption that

743
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,520
context will give you an idea of the

744
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,879
correct Rhythm so here's that measure

745
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,919
that was screwed up and here it becomes

746
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,359
very obvious that we have a DOT that's

747
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:45,480
been

748
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:48,960
added given this context but now we're

749
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,359
going to come up with a different

750
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,720
conclusion same middle

751
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,200
measure but now what's wrong is almost

752
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,200
is very very likely that we've lost a

753
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,119
flag

754
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,119
on the first eth

755
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,280
note so we have the assumption that the

756
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,560
context will give an idea about the

757
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,119
correct Rhythm and that requires a

758
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,200
certain amount of rhythmic repetition

759
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,560
and metrical stability throughout a

760
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,800
piece or across parts um there's some

761
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,960
20th century music John Cage Pier bz uh

762
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,680
Ruth Crawford Seager Gregorian chant

763
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,960
that can't do it but most music doesn't

764
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,280
behave like that most music works like

765
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,480
inin and KN music so we're just tripping

766
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,880
out all of the um Melody and just giving

767
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,880
the computer a score that looks kind of

768
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,839
like this it be a separate problem if

769
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,599
there's a note deleted to try to figure

770
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:42,640
out what pitch put it in but we're

771
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,480
trying to figure out well at least what

772
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,599
Rhythm it is so this is iined knock

773
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:52,599
music the opening with just the

774
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,960
rhythm so first thing work looked at was

775
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:56,880
distance that the probability measure

776
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,119
offers a solution based on its location

777
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,960
and score something called distance

778
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,480
probability um so distance can be

779
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,359
partwise or horizont vertical or

780
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,079
horizontal what do I mean by vertical um

781
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,839
probability measure so we're just going

782
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,680
to look at this third measure at the top

783
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,680
of in music where there's an added well

784
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,599
there's a there something doesn't add up

785
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,800
here the computer doesn't yet know what

786
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,040
you all know that there's a DOT that's

787
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,960
been added dotted eighth note but it

788
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,560
could be anything

789
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:33,720
right so yeah there it is much so one of

790
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,079
the things to do is to look at the

791
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,200
rhythms in all the other parts at the

792
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,880
same

793
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,200
time what we can do is build a histogram

794
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,800
of for the violin how often across the

795
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,800
whole piece now again this is being

796
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,040
built based on the incorrect possibly

797
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,920
incorrect o omr so you're learning from

798
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,920
you know from uh error PR scores to

799
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,160
build other error prone scores perhaps

800
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,400
but you hope that that this is act just

801
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,760
a little bit close to reality so the

802
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,960
violin mostly violin one mostly has the

803
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,760
same Rhythm or has closest the same

804
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,000
Rhythm violent 2 and the cello but for

805
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,359
the most part it's doing its own thing

806
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,200
when we look compared to the viola you

807
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:18,800
can see hey when the viola is wrong 80%

808
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,680
of the time if that measures like the

809
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,040
other measures uh the the cello might

810
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,359
have the same

811
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,200
Rhythm so that gives the probability

812
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,960
based on a horizontal a vertical and

813
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,560
then the other thing you can do is look

814
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,640
left and look right to see if that same

815
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,160
rhythm is somewhere over there in this

816
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,599
case it's not because uh it should have

817
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,000
been but there's another mistake in the

818
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,280
first measure and we can look throughout

819
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,640
the whole score not just a what's cool

820
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,760
about the horizontal thing is that

821
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,560
scores tend to be wider than they are um

822
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,079
tall other words more measures than

823
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,359
there are parts so you have more things

824
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,319
to do and we can look I'll skip over the

825
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,599
violin I think it's more interesting to

826
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,640
look at the cello um that obviously each

827
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,480
measure is always exactly identical to

828
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,400
itself so you have a one probability of

829
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,400
one it's going to be but then um you can

830
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,079
kind of see in a lot of the classical

831
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,800
things the the most often similar

832
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,599
measure is two measures on either side

833
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,920
not one because of this sort of four bar

834
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,079
structure and um the other thing that I

835
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,319
learned from this is anybody know Sonata

836
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:31,280
form uh yeah exposition

837
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:33,440
development recapitulation at some point

838
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,319
later the music comes back and so you

839
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,000
can kind of see this temporary spike in

840
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:41,560
that if you can't get it right look 97

841
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,720
measures later and you might also get it

842
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,280
right so the computer can learn just

843
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,920
from the scores what all the

844
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,319
probabilities for this particular piece

845
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,160
are and then hopefully apply them to put

846
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:55,839
it in so now we know what measures what

847
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,319
the probability of any measure having

848
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,760
the same Rhythm would be ahead of time

849
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,839
but then we need to look at second

850
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,839
probability what's the probability that

851
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:09,359
that measure that each other measure

852
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,720
might have the solution based on how

853
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,680
often certain errors happen and here's a

854
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,119
chart that I think we need to keep

855
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,560
looking at and keep judging but it was

856
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,520
the only one that I knew of at the time

857
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,760
where somebody looked at what the

858
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,319
probability that something uh that any

859
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,800
given musical object would be recognized

860
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,359
properly so 97%

861
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,920
99% some of them I don't believe

862
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,680
anything that says 100. that means not

863
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,000
enough data right but you know uh a lot

864
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,119
of things so we can look at uh

865
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,520
various uh probabilities the natural is

866
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,400
that's quite quite quite

867
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,240
low so then um this is where there

868
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,520
should have been some gigantic formula

869
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,880
with regressions but it turns out all

870
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,599
you need to do is find the probability

871
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,640
that of each measure being the same find

872
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,480
the probability that it would how how

873
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,319
many changes you would have to make and

874
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,119
multiply those two probabilities and

875
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:12,000
take the max value so and yeah it is

876
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:16,040
that simple um so the workflow normally

877
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,440
take a PDF turn it into music XML we

878
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,000
kind of stuck ourselves in to in the

879
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,960
middle take uh run it through one more

880
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,599
time I would love to be able to send it

881
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,800
all the way back into the omr pipeline

882
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,119
and say no reject that now rerun the

883
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,160
recognition with this being a

884
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,640
possibility but didn't get to that um

885
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,200
then had a whole bunch of scores where

886
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,520
we had um not not as many as I would

887
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,599
like but we had scanned Optical music

888
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,319
recognition music XML and we had the

889
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:48,040
correctly encoded one and we can look at

890
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:49,960
the number of differences before run

891
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,440
through the model and then look at the

892
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,760
new number of

893
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,240
differences um all of this code is in

894
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,680
music 21 in case you want to use it to

895
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,480
improve things how everything works and

896
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,680
the music we looked at again too many

897
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,520
canonical

898
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,200
composers average about 19% decrease in

899
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,160
error which made us very happy in a

900
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,160
field where um usually you're trying to

901
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,720
improve by 1% at a time or something and

902
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,800
Got U well and Mora Church earned the

903
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,280
best uh grad student paper award which

904
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,319
was great because she wasn't technically

905
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,119
qualified because she was still an

906
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,960
undergrad but but um yeah so it worked

907
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,160
worked pretty well um here and some of

908
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,440
the pieces got as high as 36% error

909
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,400
reduction so what happens you have all

910
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,599
original score we've marked what's the

911
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,359
errors we correct that and then post

912
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,280
correction it's correct if we got the

913
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:50,520
same Rhythm not if we um not necessarily

914
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,880
the right pitch because we didn't work

915
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,960
any time on that so these are all the

916
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,839
places to be looking

917
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,200
at here here's what the optical music

918
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:05,640
recognition software got

919
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:10,119
wrong and um the correction so it got in

920
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:14,200
this case three out of five corrected

921
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:17,359
see them all there um but the what what

922
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,440
really um came out of this work for me

923
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,720
that seemed very important was that we

924
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:27,720
are evaluating the quality of our work a

925
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:30,599
little bit wrong so there's um

926
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,680
that we need to be looking at Optical

927
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,559
music recognition that allows for

928
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,079
musical semantics to go back and forth

929
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:42,000
into things um that was a prop possible

930
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,920
implementation for how you can um make

931
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,000
it faster to do things but um so there's

932
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,960
proposals for judging how good Optical

933
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,240
music recognition software is that you

934
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,400
feed in a bunch of scores and you see

935
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,720
how you know how well does it do but

936
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,079
some of the standard scores being used

937
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,480
are ones that uh if we had to run our

938
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,240
software through would run terribly on

939
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,400
so this is one of the ones that you

940
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,559
should be able to recognize but this

941
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,280
particular score has no motivic

942
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:16,280
repetition I mean I I've never even

943
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,359
played it let me let me play it just

944
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,359
here how unusual that score is

945
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:32,880
[Music]

946
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,680
so it doesn't really behave like a

947
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,880
normal score and there's even things

948
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,599
like if if I my Optical music

949
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,680
recognition saw that c when it just

950
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,640
recognized this key signature I would

951
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,440
say you probably got it wrong that's

952
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,400
probably a c natural or you've got your

953
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,480
key signature wrong because there's no

954
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,480
reason why you would write a sharp there

955
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,480
immediately

956
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,920
there are other things that are in the

957
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,200
test beds I still think we need to do

958
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,160
like being able to recognize properly

959
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,119
this measure and I get that it's trying

960
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,520
to test can you recognize a whole bunch

961
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,160
of rests but if I saw this from an

962
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,960
regular regular piece of music I would

963
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,800
say those are probably notes in here

964
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,960
right because there's no reason to not

965
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:24,119
just write every measure like

966
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,200
this and then other things if you get

967
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:28,280
really smart you could okay well that's

968
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,800
a pedal Mark and that's a cleff Mark I

969
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:34,319
don't know a single Alto cff instrument

970
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,800
that uses one staff and has pedals so I

971
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,040
would send it back and say you got to

972
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,400
change one of these things in your

973
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,160
recognition um so I think in our quest

974
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,640
to try to give simple tests that can be

975
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,000
run very quickly we're ending up

976
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,800
optimizing our models for things that

977
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,160
don't resemble the music that most of us

978
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,160
learn um yes so there's still a ton of

979
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,400
work to be done on music theory and

980
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,040
semantics in Optical music recognition

981
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,079
choices and this is something that's

982
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,240
getting a little bit harder now with the

983
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,400
rise of most people who are trying to

984
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,559
work in this field now obviously want to

985
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,319
use machine learning artificial

986
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:17,680
intelligence and deep learning models um

987
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,599
which will be great once we get more

988
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,000
ground truths encoded and we can do

989
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,520
things right now that's the hardest part

990
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,079
of having more things lined up so that

991
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,280
the computer can learn but um it's it's

992
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,520
going to be harder and harder as long as

993
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:39,200
we're just using black boxes to be able

994
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:41,680
to um to get this uh in into there uh I

995
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,240
think uh you all have actually met the

996
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:49,079
world's expert in doing this his name is

997
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,880
Gus sha he h was here um when we moved

998
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:54,040
in another place yeah so there are

999
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,440
people who are trying to figure out a

1000
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,319
way to add uh not just not just in

1001
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,880
Optical music recognition but in any

1002
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:05,079
sort of artificial intelligence working

1003
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,079
with scores how that we can we can still

1004
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:11,319
use these big deep learning models but

1005
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:16,640
still but incorporate music theory into

1006
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:16,640
that so that's the big challenge for our

1007
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,040
time questions on this yeah what do you

1008
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,400
think the state of using deep Lear

1009
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,119
endtoend deep learning for

1010
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,680
optical yeah so what do I think this the

1011
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:31,960
state of the-art of using endend deep

1012
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,559
learning for optical music recognition I

1013
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:39,079
think it is a place um with great

1014
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:42,160
potential it is not nearly as good yet

1015
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,480
as the things you can buy um smart score

1016
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,440
sharpy uh the things that are there but

1017
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,200
it you know it's has a lot of potential

1018
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,280
and one of the things most of the work

1019
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,880
that I've seen on it is missing are the

1020
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,240
skills that you guys have here um I saw

1021
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,960
okay I'm going to forget you're going to

1022
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,440
tell me to put this back up in a second

1023
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,960
I just need a couple extra lines I I

1024
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,119
actually saw a model um

1025
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,079
where uh it was using generated scores

1026
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,040
which are a little bit different because

1027
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:13,559
they're always the same so you take an

1028
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,760
output from finale or M score or

1029
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:19,200
something you create a image file and

1030
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,119
then you know exactly where every note

1031
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,319
is because you wrote it and everything

1032
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,960
so you can generate a million ground

1033
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:28,160
truths and stuff like that and so it was

1034
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,240
you know running through a whole bunch

1035
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,079
of scores and

1036
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,359
things and this particular one it had a

1037
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,319
particular uh reinforcement learning

1038
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,920
problem that it successfully identified

1039
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,520
where all the notes were and where all

1040
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,760
the staff lines were it was getting

1041
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,880
incredibly incredibly good but could not

1042
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,760
break around 80% on then recognizing

1043
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,440
what the note was why because they had

1044
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,520
trained it on this is a this is D this

1045
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:01,640
is G this is F this is B flat

1046
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:05,559
uh this is B flat this is e actually

1047
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:09,040
we'll make it even even even

1048
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:09,040
better put that

1049
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:16,480
there that's an e

1050
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,520
sharp so these are all being

1051
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:23,440
recognized the fourth will also be right

1052
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,160
yeah that's oh sorry thank you yep um

1053
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,559
thank you very much Adam but now imagine

1054
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:33,240
you're the PO computer that's having to

1055
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:36,800
predict okay a I got it right d i got it

1056
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:41,119
right oh sorry I didn't mean that G and

1057
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,960
ignore that G I got it right uh I think

1058
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,000
that's

1059
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,720
F because it's only looking at sorry

1060
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,960
camera and people on this side because

1061
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,799
it's only looking at this amount of data

1062
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:57,079
whereas it needs some way to know that's

1063
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:58,920
sharp um yeah this this one could get

1064
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:01,160
right is B flat and then again it was

1065
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,440
saying uh I think that's G

1066
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:07,359
flat I think that's C and I think that's

1067
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:10,280
D because the training data had

1068
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,559
prioritized treble cff and once it's

1069
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,319
here has no way of getting back to here

1070
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,319
what what should the computer be trying

1071
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,760
to

1072
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,760
predict on this

1073
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:23,400
basis anyone take a guess B based on the

1074
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,040
amount of information you're trying to

1075
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,359
get the computer what would be uh an

1076
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,480
essentially incredibly good prediction

1077
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:33,319
model yeah maybe just have it predict

1078
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:39,079
like which line or space yeah what's

1079
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:42,079
yeah I see a quarter note on

1080
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:48,160
space

1081
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:50,599
three I see a 16th note on line five and

1082
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,000
then when you put all that together then

1083
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:53,760
have a separate detector trying to

1084
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,160
detect all the cffs or it can be the

1085
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,839
same one these things are pretty smart

1086
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,640
but yeah and try to do that and then

1087
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:01,200
only afterwards connect those two data

1088
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,079
to other things so that that was that

1089
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,760
was really nice that um that that was

1090
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,240
about I think four about four years ago

1091
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,480
that that this was shown to me as sort

1092
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,880
of the state-ofthe-art I think that

1093
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,720
they've gotten better since then but

1094
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,119
there's still if if these kind of

1095
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,400
mistakes were still being made four

1096
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:22,359
years ago I imagine that there's still

1097
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,839
many um stumbling blocks that you can uh

1098
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:27,680
put in for and I I think a team from

1099
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:29,880
here now with the knowledge that we have

1100
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,000
uh could you know in a year-long project

1101
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,760
produce a real State ofthe art tool yeah

1102
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,720
Misha with some of the best uh like

1103
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,520
language large language models they use

1104
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,520
like attention based models y so in this

1105
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,559
case this actually might um fix this

1106
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,359
problem because it would really

1107
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,400
priortize Stu at the beginning of the

1108
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,599
measure and and ignore the adg when

1109
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,599
evaluating half sharp yeah yeah some of

1110
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,240
you who are also taking um uh Aran Go's

1111
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,720
interactive music systems had um had a

1112
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,119
lecture from one of the experts Anna

1113
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,319
hang who is um an expert in the

1114
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,160
attention models and the the sort of

1115
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:07,200
things where you sort of have a memory

1116
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,280
and thinking back about what's what's

1117
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,000
important earlier in the data and so uh

1118
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,119
I think that that her work um and that's

1119
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,400
over at Google um project magenta I

1120
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:21,599
think that that could have a lot of of

1121
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,960
impact on the field and there's other

1122
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,160
people um naming naming a few people

1123
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,760
doesn't mean that these are the only

1124
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:30,040
people doing great things is just ones

1125
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,640
people who I seem to know but none of

1126
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,799
these people are are working

1127
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,280
particularly on the optical music

1128
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:39,680
recognition problem so again we need to

1129
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,880
someday have 21m 384 where we have a

1130
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,319
whole semester to just take our projects

1131
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,200
and do something bigger uh but we don't

1132
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,720
have something like that

1133
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,440
yet because that would be a great group

1134
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,960
project right we going to do all

1135
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,960
this any

1136
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,960
other question

1137
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:06,640
yeah you know are there any classes I

1138
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,359
know like that no right now and Paul are

1139
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,440
you

1140
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:13,920
senior you're junior there may be by the

1141
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:16,880
time you uh leave or M we are looking at

1142
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,760
creating more classes on U on artificial

1143
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,520
intelligence and music and and these

1144
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:24,760
kinds of problems um yeah so there's

1145
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,640
there's prob um but definitely well I

1146
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,680
suppose if you're junior yeah we're

1147
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,520
already too late right we're in the

1148
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,440
second semester it's just been so cold I

1149
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,280
still feel don't feel like it's Spring

1150
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,079
end of semester there but yeah there

1151
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,319
there should be more and and there are

1152
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:39,119
other schools that offer um some of

1153
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:41,319
these things and and various workshops

1154
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,880
that you could go to on some these

1155
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:44,559
techniques but we're all we're all still

1156
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,839
learning we're all still trying to

1157
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,280
create um the musical equivalent of for

1158
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,680
those who have done machine learning

1159
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,040
know the handwritten to to to to data

1160
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,680
set the classify thing which everybody

1161
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,079
does as their first artificial

1162
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,000
intelligence thing to here's all the

1163
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:06,079
different ways to's been written now

1164
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,520
here's a new number what is it um we

1165
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,559
still need that data set for optical

1166
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:15,680
music recognition here are 10,000

1167
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:18,119
quarter notes on space three from all

1168
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,160
different things and now can your system

1169
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:25,160
do that

1170
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,160
cool else

1171
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,480
well I'm going to give you time to

1172
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,799
either work on your projects or stay

1173
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,160
here or take advantage of the fact that

1174
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:42,000
um you know finally I didn't make it uh

1175
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:45,400
use up every inch my time so just um

1176
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,200
this is the end for my teaching in this

1177
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:50,200
class uh and next week I'm excited

1178
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,480
because I get to learn a lot new now

1179
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,319
I've been learning from youall but I'll

1180
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,599
get to learn a lot more so I'm looking

1181
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:59,079
forward to that um I'll have office

hours uh as soon as I'm done here and uh

1183
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:06,359
look forward to to projects so

1184
