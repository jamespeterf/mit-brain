Innovation ecosystem that drives

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,959
Innovation here at MIT but what exactly

56
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,959
is innovation at M we think of

57
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,120
innovation as the process of taking an

58
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,519
idea through impact right so that's what

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,400
we strive for and that's what we make

60
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,959
happen our research priorities as you

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,319
heard president conlu talk about we have

62
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,440
three areas that we want to focus on as

63
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,200
institutional priority we have climate

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,280
and sustainability we have life science

65
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,159
and we have ai and we want to solve big

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,920
problems we don't want to small solve

67
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,640
small problems we want to talk talk

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,280
about what is the global Challenge and

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
we want to address

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,159
it and again we want to address it in a

71
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,920
very evidence-based manner the climate

72
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,080
project I don't want to talk any further

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,000
about it because you're going to hear

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,319

share with them what your problem

98
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,479
problems are and then perhaps figure out

99
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,600
a solution to those problems problems

100
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,639
and then of course Network right network

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,759
not only through uh colleagues in

102
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,320
Industry through to faculty uh and

103
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,680
researchers through students that are

104
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,919
engaged and also in terms of startups

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,880
