1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,240
So, a very warm welcome to BT's

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,600
headquarters.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,080
Um, and an especially warm welcome to

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,640
our guests from MIT who are hosting the

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,720
MIT London Symposium today. My name is

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,320
Ed Staintton and I lead the public

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,440
sector business here within BT which

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,280
gives me a fascinating vantage point

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,719
because in my role I'm at the

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,320
intersection of politics,

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,480
technology,

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:49,280
society and business. And as I look

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,840
around um the UK and some of the

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,399
challenges that we are facing into in

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
this ever changing world, being

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,559
absolutely at the forefront of

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,960
technological innovation is key to how a

18
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,240
business like BT has ma remained

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,799
relevant for over 180 years. In fact,

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,880
next year is our 180th birthday.

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
Um, and the reason we've been able to

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,040
keep relevant is we've always been at

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,560
the forefront of innovation from

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,280
essentially forming the internet

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
um through to today where we keep ahead

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,159
of the threats that we're all familiar

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,400
with uh from cyber security to

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,159
protecting our networks against the next

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,960
wave of technological evolution. Um, for

30
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,600
example, quantum encryption is a key

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,799
area of research for us.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Um, but at the heart of research and

33
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,920
innovation is collaboration.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,560
And that's why I'm so proud that at BT

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,119
we are part of the MIT's industrial

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,240
liaison program and it's actually run

37
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,200
out and hosted by um our public sector

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,040
business because we see the read across

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,240
between uh the vital research that comes

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,599
out of arguably the most important uh

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,319
research innovator academically globally

42
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,760
um and how we then bring that back into

43
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,599
the UK and help um support our

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
government and public sector partners

45
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
and in fact if you look at the

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,440
industrial strategy for the UK that's

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,440
just recently been published by the UK

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
government at the heart of that is

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,000
actually um innovation and research

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,200
around advanced telecommunications which

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,319
is vital to keep the UK and society on

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,360
the front foot when it comes to um you

53
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,760
know evolution of our economy bearing in

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,519
mind that um techn um telecommunications

55
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,160
is very much at the heart of

56
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
underpinning many of the areas we're

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,879
going to hear about today, be it kind

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
of, you know, AI and other advanced

59
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,120
technologies.

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,160
Um, one thing I'll be reflecting on

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,080
today as I listen to the the various

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,120
amazing speakers we have coming up and

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,680
and sharing their insights with us is

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,319
the societal impact of technology.

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,720
Um, as a kid, I always daydreamed what

66
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,239
the future would be like. And I had a

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,000
vision of hoverboards, flying cars, and

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,080
this amazing, exciting, friendly world

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,680
where technology

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,200
has resulted perhaps in some dystopian

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
outcomes

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,159
um that that we see on the battlefield,

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,959
that we see in cyerspace. Um, and it

74
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,480
also has potential to completely reshape

75
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
society.

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,920
um especially with the phenomenal

77
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,840
advances we're seeing in AI shaping

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,799
society around jobs around culture

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,680
around societal interconnection.

80
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,799
Um so while technology is is a

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
fascinating area and we're going to be

82
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
certainly hearing about a lot of that

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,439
today. Um those societal impacts are one

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,920
thing that I will certainly be thinking

85
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,640
over. Um, so all I'm here to do really

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,560
this morning is to offer you a very warm

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,760
welcome before we bring up onto stage um

88
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,760
our guests from MIT.

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Thank you for the welcoming remarks. Uh

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm Gatri Shrini Vasan. I head corporate

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
relations. I'm the executive director at

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,639
MIT corporate relations.

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,199
Um with that you know at MIT we define

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,600
innovation as a process of taking ideas

95
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,639
to uh impact right as uh here we have uh

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,040
shown the nanoarchchitected carbon that

97
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
can withstand ultrasonic impacts

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,840
basically materials that laugh on the

99
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,759
face of physics. Um we are working on

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
commercial plasma fusion and clean

101
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,080
energy because why not solve the energy

102
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,680
crisis while we are at it. um and paper

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,960
thin solar cells. Um I mean that's uh

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,440
that's what we think of thin margins. Um

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,680
I think um and then of course you have

106
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,400
Bob Langanger um who's one of our

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,039
institute professors who's basically a

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,720
patent factory walking down the halls of

109
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,759
MIT uh professor Munji Bendi uh who won

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,880
the Nobel Prize uh for quantum dots uh

111
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,759
which by the way are now in your TVs and

112
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,840
helping you with Netflix binging which

113
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,960
which works for me as well and make uh

114
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,360
things look better than ever on TV. Uh

115
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,199
and by the way, we've also sent a few

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,440
people to outer space because these MIT

117
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,479
alums who uh decided that earth was just

118
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,759
not challenging enough. Um and then last

119
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,160
year we had Darren Asimoglu and uh Simon

120
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,840
Johnson who won the Nobel Prize for

121
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,120
economics. So yeah, we are covering

122
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,320
everything from atoms to astronauts to

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,400
economic systems. Um and of course you

124
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,680
saw this uh the video before so that

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,759
itself was um uh very inspiring but just

126
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,639
showing you um these uh exam examples

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,600
also help. Um speaking of impact here

128
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,000
are just a few of the companies that

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,440
were started by MIT folks and when I say

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,240
a few I mean all these and there's

131
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,240
Campbell soup. So your chicken noodle

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,039
soup has MIT DNA in it. The point is

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
MITers don't just start companies, they

134
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,759
start industries. So that's the point

135
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,759
I'm trying to make by showing this.

136
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,560
And these are just numbers. The Nobel

137
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,720
laureates, the MacArthur Genius Fellows,

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,759
all that. But beyond that, I didn't want

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,319
to focus on 362 patents, which is one

140
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,039
patent a day pretty much a year. Uh

141
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,000
which three days vacation. So I guess we

142
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,560
give people vacation. Um there's 700

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,560
companies that we collaborate with. Uh

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,800
593 invention disclosures. So a lot is

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,199
happening. So you may ask like what is

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
MIT doing now, right? What are we

147
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,039
focused on? And so that's a great

148
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,400
question. But um President uh Conluth's

149
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,120
priorities are um to double down on

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,280
these specific areas. uh climate where

151
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,560
we are marshalling our expertise to lead

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,240
on technological, behavioral and policy

153
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,800
solutions because someone has to. Um and

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,800
we've got all the kinds of solutions

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,199
including the rocket scientists uh that

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
can help solve these problems, right? Um

157
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
then we have health and life sciences

158
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,759
bringing together worldclass expertise

159
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,520
catalyze discovery and innovation for

160
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,400
human health. Um you saw Mona and that

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,360
was that helped solve our COVID uh

162
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,800
vaccination uh and you know uh uh

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,840
immunity for us. Um human insights

164
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,080
elevating human- centered um research.

165
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
We are engineers but we also remember

166
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,000
that humans are the ones who are using

167
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,440
all the technology. So we need to bring

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,319
that uh insight into existence as well.

169
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,199
um artificial intelligence uh providing

170
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,879
leadership as uh society navigates AI's

171
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,000
implications

172
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,720
um education um designing curricula that

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,240
is going to be um meaningful for the

174
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,639
digital and AI age uh manufacturing

175
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
defining future of manufacturing with

176
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,479
higher productivity lower carbon uh

177
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,959
footprint better jobs greater resilience

178
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,599
resilience um trying to make things

179
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,320
better than what it is right Now um

180
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,080
quantum amplifying quantum research and

181
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
driving innovation because regular

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,000
comput computation is not good enough.

183
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:54,000
It's just boring. Um but uh beyond that

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,680
um jokes aside um so what do we have in

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,920
the water here? What is special about

186
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,640
MIT? Um and uh it's not the weather. Um

187
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,760
it's it's you know four things that I've

188
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,560
highlighted here. One is uh we ask what

189
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,320
the problem is. um then we figure out

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,440
how to pay for it and um uh work on the

191
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,080
problems. Second, we encourage highly

192
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,360
encourage risk takingaking and uh

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,480
focusing on hard problems. We uh expect

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,640
failure on the way to success. Uh we

195
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,200
don't just tolerate failure, we actually

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,800
celebrate it towards the journey towards

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,640
uh uh as a learning opportunity. Um and

198
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
that is hard in a corporate environment

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,399
but in an academic setting it becomes

200
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,360
easier.

201
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:46,560
Um third we have well staffed uh offices

202
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,959
um that's our office which helps with um

203
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
putting industry in the room um

204
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,240
understanding the problem where and we

205
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,279
are literally here to make the

206
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,040
connections happen. Um and last but not

207
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,959
least all key ecosystem stakeholders are

208
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,839
within walking distance. We have the

209
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,640
entrepreneurs, government, corporate,

210
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,360
risk capital or venture capital um uh

211
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,920
firms, uh MIT researchers all in the

212
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,320
same neighborhood. Um we can't have

213
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,560
serendipitous conversations

214
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,640
uh or coffee meetings when everybody's

215
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
in a different time zone. Uh it just

216
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,760
makes it easier when everybody's in the

217
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,360
same place. And uh again uh it's not

218
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,680
about MIT being um the solution or

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,720
problem solver in isolation. is about

220
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,519
MIT being the catalyst to bring everyone

221
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,720
together. Um, and we are like the yeast

222
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,600
in the innovation bread. I hope that

223
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,920
sounded good.

224
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,399
Um, uh, but anyway, we we help uh uh

225
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,120
leaven and rise the bread and so I guess

226
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,800
rise innovation. Uh, but uh let me tell

227
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,560
you about uh two programs uh which our

228
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,959
office runs with. One is the industrial

229
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,079
leazison program and the second one is

230
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,880
the MIT startup exchange. The industrial

231
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,760
leazison program is the comprehensive uh

232
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,480
portal to MIT. Uh we have 200 plus

233
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,800
members who use this as the front door

234
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,120
to uh to everything that MIT has to

235
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,640
offer. Um the MIT startup exchange um is

236
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,120
a program through which we promote

237
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,000
collaboration between um industry and

238
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,200
MIT connected startups. uh we've got

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,920
over 800 uh startups in uh that we work

240
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,120
with and that's a lot of disruption

241
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,519
that's waiting to happen.

242
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,440
So um you might wonder um

243
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,560
what do you actually do once once you

244
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,399
become an ILP member right um what you

245
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
actually get is the opportunity to

246
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,839
connect with MIT around research

247
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,160
innovation students and education I call

248
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,279
it rise because it's easier to remember

249
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,200
all the four pieces but the idea is you

250
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,000
can connect around all those four pieces

251
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,880
through our conferences like this uh

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,360
leading edge webinars um inperson in

253
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,320
events ac across the globe, customized

254
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,800
events that meet your specific needs. Uh

255
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,680
meeting faculty, executive briefings,

256
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,560
learning journeys, uh with researchers

257
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,680
and experts in the field, uh meet with

258
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,399
and network with um students, the

259
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,120
startups and other peer uh organizations

260
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,160
that are part of the program. Um in

261
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,920
addition it helps uh you get upskilling,

262
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,240
reskilling and new skilling also

263
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,440
possible through our uh professional

264
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,519
education, exec education and uh open

265
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,560
learning.

266
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,360
Industry all industry now have to be uh

267
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,000
focused on innovation. So if you are

268
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,480
innovating come and talk to us we would

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,360
love to collaborate with you. And I also

270
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,040
wanted to uh let you know is that you

271
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,480
know um we are not talking about only

272
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,519
one industry or one area or a couple

273
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,360
areas. When we think about uh impact we

274
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,760
talking about all kinds of areas of

275
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,040
impact and you can see aerospace,

276
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,600
defense, automotive, um life sciences,

277
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,320
equipment, all kinds of areas where MIT

278
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,320
can help um you with your um innovation.

279
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,639
Um and this is not a Boston thing. I did

280
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,440
talk about you know serendipitous coffee

281
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,000
meetings on campus but this is a global

282
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,480
thing. So the 200 plus members that we

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
have are across the globe and this is a

284
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,839
representation of where they exist.

285
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,519
These are a few success stories of

286
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,320
companies that have worked around

287
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,360
specific projects. Um these are all

288
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,000
member companies and you know uh the way

289
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,440
to think about it is um these are kinds

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,240
of breakthroughs that are waiting to

291
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,160
happen when you bring brilliant minds in

292
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,680
your organization to work with brilliant

293
00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:00,320
minds at MIT to solve uh tough problems.

294
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,199
These are a few representations of uh

295
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,839
startup success stories. Um these are

296
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,959
companies that started with an idea uh

297
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,600
some MIT knowhow uh and a healthy dose

298
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,360
of audacity and now they are changing

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,199
the world and these are all companies

300
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,160
that they're working with uh that are

301
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,959
member companies

302
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,279
and with that I thank you for sitting

303
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,079
through my presentation but I did want

304
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,920
to emphasize that MIT is not just about

305
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,320
producing great research we we do do

306
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,480
that uh and it's not about uh creating

307
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,800
great startups which is also something

308
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,839
that we do but it's about building this

309
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,639
ecosystem of collaborators across the

310
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,760
globe solving real problems and with

311
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:49,360
that um if you want to know more about

312
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,600
ILP how to work with MIT please uh reach

313
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,839
out to us I have a few colleagues uh

314
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,560
from my team that are here um can you

315
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,680
please stand up um that's Steve Palmer

316
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,519
that's Steve Whitaker um and of course

317
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,279
there are lots of MIT folks that you

318
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,440
will see today. You can of course ask

319
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,760
them about ILP as well. With that, thank

320
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
you. Um I don't know whether there's

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,560
time for questions, but if you have a

322
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,560
question, I'm happy to answer.
