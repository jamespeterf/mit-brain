1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,240
well it's a pleasure to uh have the

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,759
opportunity to tell you a little bit

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,719
about our work in Silicon photonics

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,400
specifically for trapped ions um I think

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,280
maybe to start us off we could do a

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,279
little show of hands who's familiar with

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,640
integrated photonics or silicon

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,800
photonics Kevin's waving in the back

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,720
okay we have a couple here wonderful

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,599
Well what we'll start off with today

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,199
then is an introduction to silicon

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,279
photonics and maybe I can uh introduce a

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,719
lot of you to this wonderful field of

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,920
integrated silicon photonics we'll then

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
take a look at what we can do when we

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,239
use integrated photonics to address

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
trapped ions and then I'll um briefly

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,079
mention some of the other group other

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,360
work happening in our group The fonics

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239
Electronics Research group so this will

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,199
be a little bit of a switch and topic

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,719
the last speaker was really uh talking a

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,280
little bit more about algorithms and and

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,199
how you do these uh you know Advanced

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,719
gate operations things like that now

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,680
we're going to switch more to the

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,799
engineering side of things how can we um

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,119
deliver light to interface with

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,799
different types of cubits and

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,479
specifically trap ions in this case so

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,960
let's start with an introduction to

32
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,000
Silicon

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,000
photonics so for those of you who are

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,920
not familiar with silicon photonics the

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,320
general idea behind our field is that we

36
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,240
want to take standard seos fabrication

37
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,400
processes and repurpose them to create

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,320
optical devices and systems on chip so

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,920
on the left left hand side here you can

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,280
see a standard bulk semos transistor you

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,880
know normally when you have a seos

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,280
process you would use this process to

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,200
fabricate these transistors that are

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
going to do electrical switching and do

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,119
the standard computation that we have in

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,399
our you know classical computers here so

47
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,360
you'd have a silicon layer here this is

48
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,799
if you took your computer chip for those

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,600
of you that are maybe not as familiar

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,840
with the the hardware side of things

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,399
this would be if you take your computer

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
chip and you cross-section it in half

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,600
this is what one of these like little

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,159
nanoscale transistors would look like so

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,479
you have the Silicon over here uh then

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,399
you would have regions of what's called

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,280
doped silicon that's where you take the

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,200
Silicon you bombard it with dopin and

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,480
then you'd have metal coming down into

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,959
contact with those doped regions and

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,120
what that allows us to do is on those

62
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,200
metal lines actually apply voltages and

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,400
uh get switching of the transistor

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,080
that's what allows us to do our normal

65
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,920
classical Computing Gates right that's

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,959
what allows us to to do classical

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,319
Computing so what we can do is we can

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
take all these layers that you would

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,080
normally use for your transistor and

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,480
repurpose them to create optical devices

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,840
on chip so for example here you would

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,560
see a cross-sectional view of a silicon

73
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,480
photonics Optical wave guide what this

74
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,040
is going to look like is here in this

75
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,400
cross-sectional view it's a little

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040
rectangle if you actually took a top

77
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,159
down view on your chip what this would

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,400
look like is you'd have that little

79
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,319
rectangle and it would be a long strip

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
of that rectangle on your chip and if

81
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,080
you took maybe

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,959
electromagnetics uh at some point in

83
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,879
your engineering career um you would

84
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,519
have learned that if you have this strip

85
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,519
of dialectric material here and you put

86
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,599
in some electromagnetic wave in this

87
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,680
case it would be an optical wave into

88
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,519
that that wave guide that wave guide is

89
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,480
going to confine the light on your chip

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,040
in that little strip of silicon and it's

91
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,080
going to guide the light down the chip

92
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,040
so we have this way of confining and

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,400
Guiding Light on our seamos chip here

94
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,200
okay so we're confining and we're

95
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,560
guiding our light but we don't want to

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
just have the light on the chip we want

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,760
to be able to do operations with this

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,720
light so we need to have some way to

99
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,239
modulate the light on the chip so what

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,680
we would do is we could maybe take this

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,040
wave guide and we would create an active

102
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,760
electrooptical modulator so you'd have

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,680
your wave guide here that's confining

104
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,400
and guiding your light and then you

105
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,959
extend it on either side and then on

106
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,239
either side there maybe we'd put some of

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,640
those dopents in that allow us to have a

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
uh electrical properties in this silicon

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,920
and we place metal down into contact

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,879
with those dopin and now we can apply a

111
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,280
voltage across that wave guide and

112
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,519
through things called uh the thermal

113
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,000
optic effect or electrooptic effect

114
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,160
you're going to apply that voltage

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,359
across that doped region and it's going

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,040
to change the properties of your wave

117
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,600
guide and now when the light goes

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,479
through the wave guide it's going to

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,360
either slow up uh slow down or speed up

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,960
so you have this way of changing how the

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,199
light passes through the wave guide uh

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
we call these electrooptic phase or

123
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,360
amplitude

124
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,680
modulators and then okay we can guide

125
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,120
the light on the chip we can modulate

126
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,520
the light on the chip now we want to

127
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,080
interface with the surroundings of the

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
chip uh so to do that we would pattern

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
some more interesting more complex

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
devices maybe something like these

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
grading antennas which we'll talk about

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,240
in a few slides again um the idea there

133
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,720
is you have your wave guide on the chip

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
now all of a sudden you want to scatter

135
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,680
the light up and out of the chip to

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,560
interface with different things in the

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,880
environment for Quantum Computing that

138
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,160
thing would actually be the physical

139
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:11,000
Cubit that you're trying to interface

140
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,520
to so by uh taking these seos processes

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,479
and using them to create Optics on chip

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
we can take Optical systems that once

143
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,360
complex and bulky maybe they would take

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,600
up an entire Optical table in a research

145
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,400
lab or a ton of optical fibers all

146
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,960
connected together well we can take

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,120
these Optical systems and now we can

148
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,199
compact them down into these little

149
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,280
millimeter scale Sil photonics

150
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,319
chips a very small form factor also by

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,319
taking advantage of seos fabrication

152
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,960
processes right seos uh chips are

153
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,680
fabricated on the wafer scale you can

154
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,520
see up on the the top left here is a

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,479
photograph of a seos wafer that was

156
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,319
fabricated in our lab for silicon

157
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,919
photonics um well these seos fabrication

158
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,199
processes they're fabricated on these

159
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,840
large 12-in Wafers which allows us to

160
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,199
really scale up how many of these chips

161
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,160
we can fabricate at at a time so it's a

162
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,319
uh way to scale up the manufacturing the

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,840
both the yield and the

164
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,400
number and then uh finally by

165
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,479
integrating these optical devices onto

166
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,280
chips we can enable new functionality

167
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,840
that was never before possible with bulk

168
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,440
Optics or fiber optics and you'll see

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
why this is so important when we start

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,840
interfacing with these different types

171
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,520
of

172
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,280
cubits um maybe I'll pause here if

173
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,720
there's a question or two just to make

174
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,880
sure uh we're kind of catching think

175
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,440
everyone in the audience that maybe

176
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
hasn't seen this field of integrated

177
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,960
photonics

178
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,599
before

179
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:47,240
absolutely so I understand how you get

180
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:49,800
the the wave to go down uh of that and

181
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,840
because I've seen other

182
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,039
areas radar systems oh yeah that's

183
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,960
that's essentially wave guides for RF

184
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,280
yeah so

185
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,360
um how does that become a cub

186
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
my understanding of that is missing and

187
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,080
that's key to almost everything we

188
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,520
talked about tonight oh yeah so far no

189
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,720
cubits this is all classical so so far

190
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,039
we're just putting classical laser light

191
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
on this chip um you'll see in a few

192
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,520
slides how we can actually use this then

193
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,919
to interface with cubits so hold that

194
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,360
thought for for maybe five

195
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,360
minutes forgive me but if I could talk

196
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,479
with you on another day that would be

197
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,560
appreciated awesome yeah absolutely

198
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,759
thank you any other questions before we

199
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,759
keep

200
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,840
going you essentially creating like

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,080
Gates through this you're essentially uh

202
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,639
you're trying to take functionality that

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,720
you would normally use that you normally

204
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
use maybe an optical fiber or uh bulk

205
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,759
lenses and you're taking that and

206
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
putting it on the chip so so far we

207
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,599
haven't yet touched the quantum side of

208
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,039
things we're just thinking about how can

209
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,319
we get light on a chip and create these

210
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,560
Optical devices on the

211
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,840
chip so maybe let's keep let's keep

212
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,360
going and see uh how is quantum

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
Computing going to come into this field

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,560
of silic and

215
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,520
photonics so uh in general this field of

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,759
silic and photonics actually came up

217
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,599
because of the problem of optical

218
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,400
interconnects there was a need to take

219
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,919
data uh move around lots of classical

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,960
data to uh move data on and off the chip

221
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,919
in large volumes um and silicon ICS

222
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,159
really came about as a field because

223
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,240
there was a need to do all this data

224
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,640
movement in the optical domain where we

225
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,839
could have faster speeds and and lower

226
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,880
losses and because of this uh the field

227
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,720
of silicon photonics kind of rose up and

228
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,360
there's a lot of infrastructure put into

229
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,200
place on how can we fabricate these

230
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
chips how can we create platforms for

231
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,200
silicon photonics um all still classical

232
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,720
uh but there's a lot of money and

233
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
infrastructure poured into this field

234
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,200
and now we can take this idea of

235
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,120
integrated photonics and apply it to

236
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,000
many different other application areas

237
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,120
so things like lar sensors or ar

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,440
displays uh free space classical

239
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,320
Communications biophotonics interfacing

240
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,040
with the bi uh with the body with Optics

241
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,680
but relevant to this Workshop today is

242
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,920
that we can actually use this field of

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,760
silicon photonics to interface with

244
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,160
different types of cubits optically and

245
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,160
the Cubit that we're going to talk about

246
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
now for the next 30 minutes is the

247
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
trapped ion

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,640
so that's where uh now we're actually

249
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,160
going to bring in the quantum Computing

250
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,480
side of

251
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,399
things so who's maybe show of hands

252
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,120
who's familiar with trap

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,560
ions okay so now we have about maybe a

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,240
third of people um so trap ions are a

255
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,040
very promising modality for Quantum

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,680
Computing because they have very long

257
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,640
coherence times um they're fundamentally

258
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,920
identical and they enable High Fidelity

259
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,040
gate operations so um maybe before I

260
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,360
switch to the next slide just cuz uh a

261
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,200
good chunk of people didn't raise their

262
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,560
hands for famili familiarity with

263
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,399
trapped ions let me step back and just

264
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,399
introduce you to what a trapped iion

265
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,480
would be so if you think about back to

266
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,480
um kind of your basic quantum physics

267
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,959
class or maybe your chemistry class when

268
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,880
you have an atom right there's uh

269
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,000
neutral particles here in the center and

270
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,320
um you might have an ion where you have

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,839
some charged particle that's hanging out

272
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,079
on kind of the highest bands

273
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,560
of this

274
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,480
atom and this little charged particle

275
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,240
this ion that's hanging out here um

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,200
depending on what band this ion is

277
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,639
sitting at depending on what that state

278
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,519
of that ion is is it sitting at a a

279
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,000
lower energy level or higher energy

280
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,160
level that's effectively going to be the

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,040
one or the zero in your Quantum bit your

282
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,079
your quantum computer made out of these

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,320
trap ions so we have this ion sitting

284
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,560
here and it's going to be in these

285
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,480
different levels there's going to be

286
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
different states it can be

287
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,800
in so there's this little charge charged

288
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
particle this ion it's going to be in

289
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,959
these different states how do you

290
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,079
actually switch between states how do

291
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,760
you read out what state this ion

292
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:17,240
actually is at you need to be able to

293
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,959
use um or these states are separated in

294
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,279
energy by exactly Optical wavelengths so

295
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,360
you need to have some way to interface

296
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,040
with this little ion Cubit optically to

297
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,600
actually switch between the zero and the

298
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,639
one state or to read out when this ion

299
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,079
drops down between states it's going to

300
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,120
emit a little Photon you're going to

301
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,519
need to be able to interface with that

302
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,800
ion optically to even read out what

303
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,880
state that ion is in so there's this

304
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,079
this need for trapping that ion there um

305
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
to actually create your Cubit and then

306
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,720
some way to interface to this ion

307
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,360
optically to actually uh do all the

308
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,079
different operations for this quantum

309
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,839
computer so now let's take a look at at

310
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,040
what does this physic physically look

311
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,120
like so at first um you know we need to

312
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,600
have some way to take that ion and to

313
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,120
trap it in space so the first

314
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,480
demonstrations of this look something

315
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,199
like this this is called a pul trap uh

316
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,600
these are metal long metal rods um that

317
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,680
have DC and RF Fields actually flowing

318
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,560
through them and they're oriented like

319
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,760
this where this would be a

320
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,920
cross-sectional view if we cut this guy

321
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,760
this physical guy here um you'd have

322
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,480
these metal bars here uh red is the RF

323
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,120
potentials gray is DC potentials and if

324
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,399
we um apply just the right voltages here

325
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,160
we're going to create the correct

326
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,000
potential to actually trap this little

327
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,120
charged ion here in the center of this

328
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,480
trap this is great as a first demo right

329
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,040
but if we want to create a real quantum

330
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,720
computer we need a way to take this

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,959
system and create it in a more

332
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,040
integrated more scalable way so the next

333
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,000
huge innovation in this field of Trapped

334
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,279
iion Quantum systems was to take this

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,560
really bulk system system this this P

336
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,680
trap and integrate it down into a chip

337
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,720
so the idea is can you take these uh

338
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,639
metal bars these electrodes and actually

339
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,120
kind of flatten them down and pattern

340
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,639
them on a little chip this isn't

341
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,000
necessarily now at the stage yet where

342
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,320
we're at seos level uh complexity but

343
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,440
this could maybe just be a little

344
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,480
silicon chip here and these could be

345
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,160
little metal electrodes now on top of

346
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,639
the

347
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,760
chip these electrodes are now going to

348
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,399
be powered with those same fields to

349
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,920
create the potential to trap this ion

350
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,600
now above the chip this is physically

351
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,320
what that looks like we have this little

352
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,279
chiplet down here this is from uh an

353
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,720
image from Duke University a lot of this

354
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,160
work is transitioned to ion Q which is a

355
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,519
a big uh um company operating in this

356
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,199
space so they have this this little um

357
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,120
chip down here that's holding all of

358
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,720
these these traps and they set the Trap

359
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,040
potentials just right so that they can

360
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,040
actually trap a chain of these little

361
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,600
ions Above This

362
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,680
chip okay so this um area of thinking

363
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,560
about how can we actually get the

364
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,639
electronics to trap these ions in an

365
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,360
integrated a scalable way that's been

366
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,720
pretty well explored but now the

367
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,720
question comes as we just talked about a

368
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,000
couple of minutes ago is we have these

369
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,279
ions here now we need to actually switch

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,880
their states we need to read out their

371
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,240
states we need to do these operations

372
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,880
and all of that is done optically and

373
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,279
the problem is so we have this nice

374
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,560
little integrated way to trap the ions

375
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,440
there but we still have a huge Optical

376
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,079
table multiple Optical tables of bulk

377
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,839
Optical components that are going to be

378
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,320
required to interface with these ions in

379
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,320
this ion chain so now if you go into

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,759
kind of a state-of-the-art uh trapped

381
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,399
ion lab this is kind of the view you'd

382
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,680
see there would be an an optic lab about

383
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,759
the size of this front area here and in

384
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,360
the center Center there would be a cat

385
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,120
which I think you guys have already

386
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,800
talked about a little bit uh this

387
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,000
cryostat would be cooling ions down to a

388
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,880
very low temperature and then there

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,519
would be little windows on the side of

390
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,000
that cat literally Windows um and then

391
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,279
we have a whole room filled with Optical

392
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,279
tables with bulk Optics that are taking

393
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,639
different wavelengths and polarizations

394
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
of light phase stable light and bringing

395
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,440
it in through those windows to interface

396
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,480
with the ions that are sitting in this

397
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,040
cryostat quantum computer

398
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,440
right um it looks super cool it's also a

399
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,959
little bit scary you know I go into our

400
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,639
collaborators Labs that are working on

401
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,720
this and you're like don't breathe you

402
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,600
know there's all these bulk Optics all

403
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,800
perfectly aligned and and you know

404
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,440
hundreds of components all required to

405
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,600
interface with these ions so the problem

406
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,279
is that how is this scalable right you

407
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,160
have a whole room worth of bulk Optics

408
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,399
just to interface with maybe tens of

409
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,160
ions in this uh cry stat if you want to

410
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,399
scale up to tens of thousands of ions

411
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,959
many cubits just like uh was um really

412
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
emphasized by our previous speakers that

413
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,880
we need to scale up the number uh this

414
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,680
is not going to be a scalable way to

415
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,959
interface with those ions right the

416
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,120
hardware is not scalable it would take

417
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,880
like a M's worth of bulk Optics to

418
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
figure out how to do that also the more

419
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,759
pressing problem right at the moment is

420
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,360
that uh you know when we talk to our

421
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,399
friends in the atomic physics world all

422
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,319
these Optical tables are vibrating

423
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
slightly differently they're all sitting

424
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,720
in the room vibrating slightly

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,279
differently the bulk Optical lenses are

426
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,839
all vibrating slightly differently and

427
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,160
when all these different uh wavelengths

428
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,160
and polarizations of light now come in

429
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,680
to interface with our ion the coherence

430
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,519
of those Optical beams is going to be

431
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,959
messed up so you can imagine if things

432
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,759
are vibrating slightly differently the

433
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,680
light as it's coming in is going to have

434
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,759
a slightly different phase as it hits

435
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,480
your Ion it's going to mess up the

436
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,240
coherence which r produces the Fidelity

437
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,559
of your Quantum operation on that

438
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,039
ion so there's really a need to to think

439
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,679
about a way we can take all these Optics

440
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,199
and make them more scalable and also

441
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,919
phase stable to improve the coherence of

442
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,959
this uh of these

443
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,120
operations and the solution to that is

444
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,720
what we talked about right at the

445
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,000
beginning can we create computer chips

446
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,520
now these photonic chips that have

447
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,080
integrated photonics components that

448
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,080
have all those Optics but now integrated

449
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,799
on your chip to interface with your Ion

450
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,520
maybe we're seeing where the this uh

451
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,400
field of integrated photonics can come

452
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,000
into play so what that looks like is now

453
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,480
we have this this chip here you can see

454
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,960
these metal lines the the yellow those

455
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,240
are going to be those RF electrodes that

456
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,440
are actually going to trap your Ion

457
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,120
electrically above your chip the ion is

458
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,440
shown here in light

459
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,440
blue so we we've again like I mentioned

460
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,840
before this is a pretty well-known uh

461
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,640
technique this Paul trap on chip but now

462
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,159
we need to have all these Optical beams

463
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,720
interfacing to the ion also coming uh

464
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,760
from our chip so here we would have our

465
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,520
integrated silicon photonics wave guides

466
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,919
coming

467
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,760
in these would be our tiny little

468
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,919
Optical antennas that are going to emit

469
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,880
the light up and out of the Chip And to

470
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,280
the the point where the ion is trapped

471
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,440
there above the chip you'll notice that

472
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,480
these um in this this rendering here

473
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,039
from our friends at Lincoln Labs uh

474
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,720
they've colored the beams in different

475
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,320
colors and that's because we actually

476
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,640
need different wavelengths or different

477
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,400
colors of light to interface up to the

478
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,559
ion to do different operations on the

479
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,919
ion so this requires uh the different

480
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,840
operations that we're thinking about

481
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,440
here is cooling the ion so you trap the

482
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,320
ion there now you need to cool it down

483
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,039
to kind of stabilize its motion then you

484
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,400
have to do state preparation so

485
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,240
initializing what state is it a one or a

486
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,320
zero that that ion is initi

487
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,679
in um you need to do state excitation

488
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
right when we actually want to perform

489
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,640
operations on that Cubit we need to

490
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,919
excite different states and then also

491
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,760
optically we need to read out when the

492
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:17,640
ion actually um fluoresces out in uh

493
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,960
Photon when it drops down between states

494
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,760
we need to read that Photon out and also

495
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,760
capture it optically these are all

496
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,159
Optical operations then now we can think

497
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,880
about doing on one of these photonic

498
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,919
silicon photonic chips so we'd have this

499
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,200
chip here uh what this is going to

500
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,720
physically look like in our larger

501
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,720
system is this photonic chip would be

502
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,919
sitting down here this would all be in a

503
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,840
uh cry

504
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,919
stat um your Ion actually is is flipped

505
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,880
down underneath the chip here and then

506
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,880
you'd have some Optical fibers bringing

507
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,919
light from an off chip laser and

508
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,720
coupling it onto this photonic chip and

509
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,799
then you would do all your operations

510
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,440
that you need to do on your chip doing

511
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,120
all that light delivery to uh in this

512
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,880
case this would be a single ion but of

513
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,320
course we can also scale up to multiple

514
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,520
ions and one of the very key components

515
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,440
for this is uh these Optical antennas on

516
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,480
chip so what that would look like is

517
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,240
you'd have your your silicon photonics

518
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,240
wave guide that dialectric wave guide

519
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,080
that's confining light on your chip and

520
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,640
then you'd have some little what we call

521
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,280
grading coupler or grading antenna that

522
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,120
is going to take that light off the chip

523
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,480
and then scatter it up to your Ion what

524
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,080
that physically looks like is you have

525
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,320
your wave guide and you patter these

526
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,840
little pertubations in the wave guide

527
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,520
that causes scattering at each of the

528
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,960
pertubations if you design them just

529
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,840
right you can get all that light to emit

530
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,600
up and uh to the ion through those um

531
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,600
metal electrodes that we patterned

532
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,919
earlier um so how do you actually make

533
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,159
this concept come to life is again you

534
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,720
need platforms to actually fabricate

535
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,760
these photonic chips in uh so what that

536
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,000
could look like is you here's an example

537
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,120
Le of the platform that we fabricate in

538
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,480
um you have different wave guiding

539
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,080
layers this is a silicon nitride wave

540
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,640
guide uh you could have multiple layers

541
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,320
that would allow you to maybe cross the

542
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,360
wave guides once you start scaling up to

543
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,919
larger numbers of cubits uh have

544
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,760
different operations happening in these

545
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,240
different wave guides then you have

546
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,799
these emitters that are emitting light

547
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,279
off the chip up to the ion that's

548
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,760
sitting above the chip uh you could have

549
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,559
some modulator layers like we talked

550
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,200
about earlier maybe modulating the light

551
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,080
that's actually in that chip and you

552
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,720
could even

553
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,440
um uh have these modulators connected to

554
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,159
integrated Coss control Electronics on

555
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,080
that same chiplet so really thinking

556
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,720
about how can we scale up these trapped

557
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,720
iion quantum

558
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,039
computers so the advantages of moving to

559
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,760
integrated photonics for this uh like we

560
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:54,080
talked about is the coherence and the

561
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,240
scalability so here um this is nice work

562
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,039
coming out of uh lincol Labs a couple of

563
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
years ago they actually did an

564
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,840
experiment

565
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,400
um where you can see if you have a you

566
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,799
know your your Ion trap chip sitting

567
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,640
here it's trapping your your Ion in this

568
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,240
case below the Chip And then you have

569
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,400
free space beams coming in um from all

570
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,760
those free space Optics those free space

571
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,240
beams are all vibrating differently than

572
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,960
your your uh trap chip and that's what's

573
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,240
going to cause this um reduction in the

574
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,520
coherence reduction the fidelities of

575
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,159
these operations when you move to

576
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,360
integrated now you have uh the light

577
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,960
coming in and it's actually emitting off

578
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,000
of the same chip that the ion is

579
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,240
registered to the ion is trapped to that

580
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,120
chip and now we're going to emit all the

581
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,480
optical beams off the same chip

582
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,760
everything is going to be nicely

583
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,000
vibrationally stabilized you're going to

584
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,799
improve your coherence you're going to

585
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,559
improve your

586
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:54,279
Fidelity and then I just love this video

587
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,440
um showing how we could think about

588
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,880
scaling these systems let's see if we

589
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,880
can play it

590
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,039
so so far we really thought about um

591
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,679
just interfacing to a single ion that

592
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,480
would be like a single cubit in the

593
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,120
system we want to really scale up to

594
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,360
multiple cubits so here would be our

595
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,120
single ion it would be sitting above all

596
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,919
these grading couplers that are emitting

597
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,080
light off the chip then you could

598
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,960
shuttle that ion between these different

599
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,240
SES

600
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,159
right and now you could have gradings

601
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,960
that are interfacing um to this single

602
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,039
ion and now you can Envision creating a

603
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,120
a kind of grided up version of this

604
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,760
where you'd have multiple sites your

605
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,200
ions are shuttling between these SES and

606
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,679
that's really what's going to get us to

607
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,120
the point of scaling up this this uh

608
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,159
trapped iion um Quantum system concept

609
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,559
so would be really hard to do if all

610
00:23:52,159 --> 00:24:00,440
that all those light beams were coming

611
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,440
from off chip um bulk Optical components

612
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,840
so of course we can never talk about um

613
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,400
research without sending a big

614
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,000
acknowledgement to all the the other

615
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,240
work happening in this field um so I I

616
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,960
you know kind of highlighted uh here the

617
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,440
work Happening by our collaborators at

618
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,880
MIT Lincoln Labs initial work um kind of

619
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,440
spearheading a lot of this integrated

620
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,919
photonics for trapped isons was done

621
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,919
here at MIT and Professor reiv rah's

622
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,279
group in collaboration with it Lincoln

623
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,320
Labs the team led at that time by uh

624
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,840
Jeremy sage and then we have seen an

625
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,480
explosion of excellent results coming

626
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,480
out of many groups um around the world

627
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,159
some uh great work coming out of eth

628
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,960
Zurich and and Jonathan Holmes Group uh

629
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,080
an Oxford Group doing excellent work

630
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,720
also an integrated photonic Sandia has a

631
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,559
lot of efforts in this space um Cornell

632
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,000
there's a new Pi uh that's working in

633
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,159
this space and then even when we look

634
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,880
more broadly we have all this research

635
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,520
happening but now there's been an

636
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,720
adoption of these techniques in the

637
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,159
indust industrial space so we see

638
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,799
companies like ionq coming up um that

639
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,640
are uh not just thinking about scaling

640
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,600
up ion traps but also bringing in the

641
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,200
integrated photonics to interface

642
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,000
optically with those uh trap Dions

643
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,120
quantium is another company Honeywell

644
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,799
all doing excellent

645
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,159
work um I wanted to highlight really

646
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,919
quick the work happening in our group

647
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,880
here at MIT uh by all of my excellent

648
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,080
students this is all done uh in

649
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,960
collaboration with MIT Lincoln

650
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Labs um so all the the previous demos

651
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,200
that we looked at were all thinking

652
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,720
about interfacing with these ions with

653
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,840
just maybe a single beam of light uh a

654
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,039
single

655
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,640
polarization uh which limits the

656
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:53,320
functionalities that we can get out of

657
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,840
these trapped ion uh Quantum systems so

658
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,440
what our group has been focusing on in

659
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,760
collaboration with linking Labs is

660
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,279
enabling polarization diverse

661
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,679
integrated uh photonic beam delivery to

662
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,799
enable more advanced functionality this

663
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,799
has been done in bulk Optics but so far

664
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,960
hasn't really been touched by integrated

665
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,080
photonics so the first thing that we are

666
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,399
looking at is um what are different

667
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,279
architectures where we have these

668
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:17,480
multiple polarizations of beams coming

669
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,039
out what can they actually enable and

670
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,720
one thing is I I mentioned that one of

671
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:24,120
the main functionalities of Optics in

672
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,320
these trapped ion system is cooling the

673
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,840
ion to low temperatures to stabilize the

674
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,200
ion um fundamentally this cooling is

675
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,039
usually limited to What's called the

676
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,039
Doppler limit if you've heard of Doppler

677
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,960
cooling there's going to be a floor how

678
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:40,799
cool that ion can actually get what you

679
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,000
can do instead of being limited by the

680
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,159
stop low limit is if you have multiple

681
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,360
polarizations of light you can

682
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:52,279
incentivize cooling to subd Doppler uh

683
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,159
uh floors and what that would look like

684
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,399
is you'd have this chip sitting here

685
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,279
you'd have these gradings emitting light

686
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,080
out of the chip but they won't just be

687
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,640
emitting a single polarization you'd

688
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,279
have two different polarizations of

689
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,279
light coming up to the ion this creates

690
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,840
what's called a polarization gradient

691
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,960
which induces different transitions in

692
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,600
the ion and enables this subd Doppler

693
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,159
cooling using a technique called

694
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,559
polarization gradient cooling or

695
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,760
electromagnetically induced

696
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,960
transparency to enable that we have to

697
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,399
think about devices on chip that uh are

698
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,640
going to prepare these different

699
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,120
polarization States so here's nice work

700
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,840
led by my students um Ashton and Tall

701
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,799
where we showed the first integrated

702
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,919
polarization Splitters and rotators on

703
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,240
chip that operate down at the visible

704
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,200
wavelength that's required for

705
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,240
this then um my student Sabrina with

706
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,200
help from Ashton and Mila designed these

707
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,120
grading couplers that now don't just

708
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,480
emit te uh polarizations of light but

709
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,760
emit both te and TM so you have to do a

710
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,559
lot of different electromagnetics device

711
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,440
design to enable this and again this is

712
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,679
the first uh gradings that can actually

713
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,120
emit both polarizations to interface

714
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,120
with ions

715
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
uh Sabrina then uh took these chips

716
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,960
where we have these these U multiple

717
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,120
gradings emitting different

718
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,039
polarizations and with the help of the

719
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,039
MIT quana group of postto Ethan and and

720
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,880
graduate student Felix they took these

721
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,440
chips put them in the crat and actually

722
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,559
trapped an ion above the surface and

723
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,240
then induced this polarization gradient

724
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,519
using these multiple polarizations of

725
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,519
light uh to show the first polarization

726
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,320
gradient um result with integrated

727
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,480
photonics and here we're actually able

728
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,799
to now cool four times below the

729
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,279
fundamental Doppler limit um with this

730
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,600
kind of system which we're really

731
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,480
excited

732
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,640
about and then also uh you know we

733
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,360
mentioned how another um operation that

734
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,799
we need to do with uh optics for ions is

735
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,919
to not just uh excite different

736
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,320
transitions for cooling and state

737
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,480
preparation and excitation but also to

738
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,679
be able to collect photons that are

739
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,919
emitting out of the ion and to do that

740
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,320
we have to design uh we call collection

741
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,880
grading so your Ion is sitting up here

742
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,720
uh it's emitting a photon out um you

743
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,399
need to be able to collect that photon

744
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,880
with some integrated device and then

745
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,440
bring it to a detector to be able to

746
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,279
understand what the state of that ion is

747
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,240
so here again in collaboration with the

748
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,519
qu group we showed the first um

749
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,519
integrated collection gradings for

750
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,519
ions um I hope this gives you a flavor

751
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,880
for for where we can go uh with this

752
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,360
field in general

753
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
um maybe now for the just the last

754
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,679
couple of minutes I'll uh briefly switch

755
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,360
gears and just U mention very briefly

756
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,399
some of the other research directions in

757
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,760
our group just to give you a feel for

758
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,480
what else you can do with silicon

759
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,440
photonics Beyond um interfacing to these

760
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,519
uh Cubit trap

761
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,960
Dions so one of our research directions

762
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,000
is thinking about can you create these

763
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,240
silicon photonic chips that emit light

764
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,840
off the chip scan those Optical beams

765
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,519
around light gets reflected back and is

766
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,240
received by the same chip to enable a

767
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,120
non-mechanical solid state-based liar

768
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,880
for autonomous vehicles this is work LED

769
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,519
uh by my students Daniel and Ben with

770
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,240
the help of

771
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,840
M another area where silicon photonics

772
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,200
can have a huge impact is in displays so

773
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,159
here uh Mila with the help of Andre and

774
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
Henry is creating a chip that can is

775
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,840
actually transparent and can sit in

776
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,519
front of your eye and it has all these

777
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,880
integrated photonic components that emit

778
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,159
light off the chip and actually project

779
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,519
3D holographic images um for the user to

780
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,559
see for augmented

781
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,200
reality to enable this um we need to

782
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,519
think about how can we uh create these

783
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,880
chips that can actually sit in front of

784
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:47,600
the eye um before everything was uh all

785
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,360
these silicon photonic devices were

786
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,440
focused on Silicon Wafers that are not

787
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,760
transparent so here we showed the first

788
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,399
demonstration of 300 mm silicon

789
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,639
photonics platform that's actually

790
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,399
transparent we also have to think about

791
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:03,639
modulators for all of these applications

792
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:07,600
and even for trapped iron Cube uh

793
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,320
Quantum systems so here uh mil led the

794
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
demonstration of the first liquor

795
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,039
crystal-based modulators that enable

796
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,039
compact uh visible light modulators on

797
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,760
chip we can also think about silicum

798
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,760
photonics um to create 3D printers so

799
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,120
the idea here is to have a chip that

800
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,480
sits in the palm of your hand and

801
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,480
actually projects three-dimensional

802
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,279
hologram into a vat of resin to cure 3D

803
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,159
objects without needing all the complex

804
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,159
Optics that's normally required for

805
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,120
highresolution uh resin based 3D

806
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,399
printers so this was uh creating a

807
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,559
portable chip based 3D

808
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,080
printer we can also create chips that

809
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,919
emit light off the chip to trap and

810
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,720
manipulate biological particles here um

811
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,000
work led by my student t with help from

812
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,960
Sabrina Mila we are actually trapping

813
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,440
and manipulating cancer cells on

814
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,080
chip uh when we think about bi photonics

815
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,880
we have to create Wafers that don't just

816
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,360
sit on the body but that mold to the

817
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,200
body or maybe get integrated in textiles

818
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,159
so they have to be flexible so here

819
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,320
we're showing the first 300 mm flexible

820
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,320
uh

821
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,760
Wafers and then finally we can create

822
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,679
chips that actually going to Comm uh um

823
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,080
uh transmit data highspeed data uh

824
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,320
through free space channels so here um

825
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,360
work led by uh Daniel and mitaa we're

826
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,120
actually creating chips that emit light

827
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,159
through water and enable um underwater

828
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,880
Communications so again just to give you

829
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,240
a flavor for the the uh work that we can

830
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,039
do with silicon photonics impact we can

831
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,440
have outside of just uh Quantum

832
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,880
Computing and Quantum

833
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,440
sensing so with that I'll wrap up and we

834
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,960
started out with just giving you a

835
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,760
flavor for what is silicum photonics we

836
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,760
then took a look at silicon photonics

837
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,600
for trapped ions right motivated by this

838
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,600
need for interfacing to ions optically

839
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,919
to enable these different

840
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,039
functionalities how we can can create um

841
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,039
these devices and platforms to enable

842
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:08,480
integrated um addressing of ions to

843
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,360
improve uh scalability Fidelity and um

844
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,480
really find a way forward for trap IR

845
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,519
Quantum Computing that's that's truly

846
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,799
scalable and I just very briefly

847
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,240
introduced you to some of our other

848
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,840
research directions of course I could

849
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,360
never give a talk without giving a huge

850
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,840
shout out to all the wonderful students

851
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,240
in my group um all their wonderful work

852
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,240
is really what enables all of uh this

853
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,080
work to move forward and specifically

854
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,080
for this talk I'll highlight our

855
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,840
collaborators at MIT Lincoln Laboratory

856
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,960
um led by uh John Trini um and John also

857
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,639
spend some time here at MIT in the

858
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,039
quantum group led by Ike Chang uh so

859
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:45,279
it's been a pleasure also collaborating

860
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,200
with the students in that group in

861
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,120
addition to the team at lincol

862
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,480
Labs so with that maybe um just because

863
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,000
we started a little bit late maybe I'll

864
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,840
just pause for one or two questions and

865
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,880
then hand it over to Kevin so we can get

866
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,559
back on

867
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:09,639
time How are um TR how do

868
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:12,800
trap encode Quant qits and how do you do

869
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,839
one and two gate

870
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,720
um operations Yeah question yeah sure

871
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:22,800
I'll repeat it uh so the question here

872
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,399
was how um how is the actual encoding of

873
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,839
uh these operations done on the ion and

874
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:30,440
maybe how you could scale up to multiple

875
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,879
uh two cubits Gates or things like that

876
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,359
um so the way that we actually encode

877
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,119
information on these ions is in their

878
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,200
state so uh like we were very briefly

879
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,800
mentioned earlier you know normally this

880
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,520
ion is sitting here in some band on your

881
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,440
atom and depending on what band that ion

882
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,639
is sitting at that's going to

883
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,960
essentially correspond to a zero or a

884
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,200
one in your quantum computer it's going

885
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,800
to correspond to the state of the ion so

886
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,200
how you encode where which state this

887
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,280
ion is sitting in

888
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,800
is exactly with these Optical beams that

889
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,760
are going to kick that ion up in energy

890
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,920
to higher further away from the nucleus

891
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,640
or they're going to kick it down pH

892
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,960
sorry what about phase yeah so so you

893
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,839
would you would kind of uh create these

894
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,040
um uh you you would encode the state

895
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,000
using these Optical uh beams and then if

896
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,079
you actually wanted to go in and create

897
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,400
higher order Gates then you could take

898
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,040
two ions bring them interact them

899
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,839
together just like we saw in that that

900
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,839
quick video I showed um so the the two

901
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,160
ions would then be shuttled together

902
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,680
they would interact and then they' be

903
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,280
shuttled back and then they could kind

904
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,240
of go in and interact with other ions in

905
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,440
this array of uh cubits there how you

906
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,680
control what what what it is that how

907
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,200
they interact right because that's

908
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,680
obviously what the gate is yeah and

909
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,040
that's that's all done optically so

910
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,560
that's going to be um often you would

911
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,680
even have two different species of ions

912
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,520
so you could have for example strontium

913
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,920
and barium and these two different ions

914
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,359
they're going to require slightly

915
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,800
different Optical frequencies to switch

916
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:08,680
between their states and so how you

917
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,640
actually excite these different

918
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,760
operations is you would choose which

919
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,400
Optical frequency you actually excite up

920
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,640
to the ion to decide what operation

921
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,319
