1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,240
okay actually so before I I continue a

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,840
few admin uh one administrative

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,439
announcement uh how okay there's a

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,199
signup sheet

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,640
describe you guys saw this very fast

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,439
inscribed uh like uh it's all taken so

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,160
that's great if anyone how many people

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,760
here are taking this class for credit

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,760
and did and did not sign up to

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,239
scribe okay so come talk to me we'll um

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,360
okay I want to mainly gauge the numbers

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,760
uh but uh that's fine H so let me tell

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,920
you two options either you can scribe

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,320
with someone that's okay with me but but

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,800
it's okay if you don't scribe there's

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,640
other things small things in the in in

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
in the scribing regime that can that I I

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,559
can happily hand out so just come talk

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,439
to me if you didn't scribe okay uh and

20
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,720
thank you so much for scribing for kind

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,200
of uh picking up the spot so so quickly

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,479
okay so uh before I explain the two to

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
one the the problem with the you know

24
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,960
from one claim to two claims I want to

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,200
recap a a little bit because I had some

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,799
questions in the break and I want to

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,880
make sure uh to try to clarify okay so

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:28,640
what are we doing here the verify the

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,479
prover is arguing that in layer I

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,920
starting with layer zero

31
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,680
the value at a certain point in the

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
layer the eventually it's in the

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,079
extension the beginning it's not the

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,119
extension the value is some Vi Star now

35
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,920
we know that so he's actually claiming

36
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,320
that Vi Star is the value of the

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,280
extension but by this calculation we

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,479
know that in the some in in other words

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,719
he's claiming that Vi Star is this sum

40
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,719
of this gigantic thing so he's claiming

41
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,399
V Star is sum over p in h to them some

42
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,920
over W1 W2 in h to them

43
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,520
of okay so the claim is that Vi Star is

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,400
equal to sum of multivariate low deegree

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,000
polinomial what we're going to do we're

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
going to do this exact blackbox some

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,120
check

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,280
protocol where beta the value we're

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,440
claiming we're claiming is Vi Star so

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,959
the Prov is claiming that the sum of

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
this entire thing is going to be F okay

52
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,599
this function is f and he's claiming

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,840
that the sum so if you call this entire

54
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,840
function this thing

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,680
F the Prov is claiming that Vi Star is

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,239
equal to sum on P

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:57,400
W1

58
00:02:50,239 --> 00:03:00,080
W2 of f p W1 W2 in h to them each each

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,360
one in h to them so the Prov is is

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,480
claiming that VI started this sum and

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,319
this F is some kind of low degree

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
polinomial so what we're going to do

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,440
we're just going to do blackbox this Su

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,319
check you don't you don't need to

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,239
remember what the sum check protocol is

66
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,440
okay but if you remember you just the

67
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,840
pro constantly checks sends kind of

68
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,239
Univar lowre polinomial being checked

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,959
blah but if you don't want to remember

70
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,920
what it is don't remember the only

71
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,879
important thing to remember is that the

72
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,319
end and during the subject protocol the

73
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
verifier just sends r this he doesn't

74
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,439
need to know anything he sends a random

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,680
uh field element gets back a univ pomal

76
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,519
does some check sends a random field

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,280
element He never actually needs to know

78
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,959
what this flda is the only point where

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,280
he actually needs to verify compare

80
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,159
something with filda is where he needs

81
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,680
to

82
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:58,920
check that

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:00,319
F Tilda of z0 Z1 Z2 is equal to some T I

84
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,000
don't know to some element

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
that came out from the subject protocol

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,920
some field element T that came

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,040
out but the thing is so how does he

88
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,879
check it in the Su check we said let's

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,120
assume he has Oracle access to

90
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,639
it but now he doesn't have Oracle access

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
this gigantic

92
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,600
mess so what do we do so first thing let

93
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
me help say okay he does have oral

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
access to add Tilda and M Tilda let's

95
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,039
assume that but even then he doesn't

96
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,639
know what this VI he doesn't know the he

97
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,320
can't compute the Lo extension of one

98
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,600
layer below so he doesn't know the

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,720
extension on Z1 and

100
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,280
Z2 so these are really the only things

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,199
he doesn't know if beyond the adld mlda

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,759
which way who he knows if he knew them

103
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,680
then he can check and he can catch you

104
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
the prover but he doesn't know them so

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,160
now we say Okay so we're not done we

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,479
don't just do some protocol I mean I

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,039
said you car is only some Che but it's

108
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,280
many some checks not just one so we're

109
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,400
not done so now we say you know what the

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,039
ver the prover will give the ver

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,280
fire the values these two values he say

112
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,039
you know what you can't compute them

113
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,680
unknown I'll tell you what they

114
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,400
are now of course he's going to cheat

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,840
because he if he tells honestly he's

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,000
going to get caught because our by the

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,600
subject protoc with very high

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,720
probability this T is actually not the

119
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,520
right

120
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,919
value so because of the soundness he's

121
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,120
going to catch him this is not the

122
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,759
correct value so now when the verifier

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,039
so now the verifier tells the approver

124
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,240
give me these two values

125
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,080
if he gives the correct value then the

126
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,639
verifier will compute the correct F and

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,240
he'll notice the cheat and he'll reject

128
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,919
him so now what we know is if the prover

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,960
wants to win he must

130
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,600
give false answers one of these answers

131
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,919
or both must be false otherwise he's

132
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,160
going to be

133
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:57,160
caught okay and therefore we reduced a

134
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,800
claim from layer I the two claims and

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,800
layer I plus one

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,360
is there is there any question about

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,840
this do is does anybody want me to

138
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,000
repeat what I just said maybe in

139
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:18,680
different words or is this clear okay so

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,680
now what what uh a what do we

141
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,240
do okay

142
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,840
so so let me

143
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,440
actually

144
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:36,240
a okay so what do we do so the a

145
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,919
is so in the actually the GK paper

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,599
itself well what we did is uh we did

147
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,160
kind of another protocol for go to two

148
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,560
claims to one claim but actually there's

149
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,000
a much much simpler idea which is

150
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,560
actually Rachel's idea

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
a where you don't need to do anything

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,039
actually so here's the idea don't do

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,039
anything actually it's not a problem

154
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,960
I know it's funny but it's actually not

155
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:10,479
a problem why is it not a problem so we

156
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,599
reduced from one claim to two claims

157
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,400
fine continue with two claims now I'm

158
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,520
saying what do you mean continue with

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,840
two claims you're gonna get four claims

160
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,720
and eight claims that's

161
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,919
terrible so the

162
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,960
yeah what oh it's Lisa's idea okay

163
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,960
Lisa's idea okay

164
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:35,080
um a so you go right it was Lisa's idea

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,039
I forgot a so you go from from so you

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,599
you just continue with two and now

167
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,319
you're saying if you can do with two

168
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,560
you're GNA get to

169
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,720
four so the point is you're not you're

170
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,520
going to stay with two and you're going

171
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,919
to stay with two and stay with two and

172
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:55,199
stay with two why so here's the idea

173
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,720
okay we reduced it to

174
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,159
two claims about layer i+ one

175
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,360
so now when we go down we're going to do

176
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,720
two sum checks we're going to do again

177
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,840
the exact same sum check but twice

178
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,800
because now we have two claims so now

179
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,319
we're in okay so let's see Let Me Maybe

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,199
write it so it'll be a little clearer so

181
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,800
let me actually write a little bit the

182
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,759
the notation so now let's for let's call

183
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:30,240
this I have this function uh let's call

184
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:37,479
Fi the sum fi is a function of

185
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:40,560
p uh yeah P W1 W2 and all it does is it

186
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:44,399
does a

187
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,760
add it reduces the value of checking on

188
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
P to checking two elements in layer I +

189
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,600
one I'm just I want to have a neat

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,240
notation so we'll be able to see it so

191
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,760
it does some it it does sorry it checks

192
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,760
if it's

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:08,360
add p w 1 W2 if so it checks add and it

194
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:13,000
adds a v

195
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:20,079
i well we'll do the extension but VI on

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,120
a W1 plus uh VI + 1 VI + 1 and

197
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,640
W2 plus

198
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,200
malt so I'm just I want to give this a

199
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,440
name so we'll have it this is I this is

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:40,000
i p W 1

201
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:40,000
W2 time VI + 1 W1 time VI + 1

202
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:49,040
W2 so for each and every uh W1 and W2 we

203
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,519
check whether you know uh we want to go

204
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,120
to one layer below so we check that the

205
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,360
the whether it's a if it's an add we do

206
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,320
an add if it's a malt we do a malt and

207
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,320
at the end we also multiply this

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:13,519
with Kai of p and w zero

209
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
right uh

210
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,640
no hey one second that was the claim

211
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:31,320
um let me call it

212
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,320
Z this is fi of Z

213
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,000
okay uh good and now we can think of

214
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,000
this as a polinomial because it's all

215
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,920
extended okay and what we check we check

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,360
we got a value VI and we check or Vi

217
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:54,079
Star we checked that Vi Star is the sum

218
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,760
of F this is z star that was the

219
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,880
star we check that it's

220
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,320
f i z i star

221
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:09,079
of P W1

222
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,600
W2 of of P W1 W2 in h to

223
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:16,480
them okay so this is where we start

224
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,399
right we have a a value on layer we have

225
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,760
a a fixed zi star in layer I there's a

226
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,360
claim that it that the extension that

227
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,880
point is equal Vi Star and we know that

228
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,920
the sum just by kind of this calculation

229
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,040
that Vi Star should be if you are honest

230
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,680
it should be sum of this

231
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,880
polinomial F and we do a sum check and

232
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,440
when we do a sum check we reduce and now

233
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,160
we reduced it to a claim after this so

234
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,160
we do so now in the G

235
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:57,120
protocol first we do a sum

236
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,120
check for so for each layer

237
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,920
what do we do su check corresponding to

238
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:09,320
f

239
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,399
i uh for proving that Vi Star which we

240
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,720
got from the previous layer okay we got

241
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,040
it so in original it's from the it's the

242
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
claim V v0 Star is the claim of the

243
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,839
approver the original kind he claimed

244
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,880
that c x that c of x equals v0 star

245
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,000
that's the original v0 Star and then we

246
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,920
check we do some check that this is

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,639
equal to X f i zi star these are both

248
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,639
the claims that we started with on

249
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,639
a

250
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:50,760
a sorry uh so we the sum P W1 W2 on f i

251
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:53,959
zi star of P W1

252
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,399
W2 so we do we do this Su check at the

253
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,760
end of this sum check we reduced it to

254
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,959
checking two things we reduced it to

255
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,880
checking

256
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,959
V

257
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:14,680
Tilda a two things v i +

258
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:19,240
one one star and v i + 2 two star so we

259
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,240
have two v's now and on

260
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
two wait

261
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:34,240
what oh one sorry sorry I one yeah I +

262
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,360
one and then two points we call it Z1 Z2

263
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,040
but these are random points from the

264
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,320
prover okay that these are so this

265
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,959
should

266
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:46,440
be Z1 and Z2 respectively these are now

267
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,440
star because they're going to be

268
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:56,560
fixed okay so now we have a new Su check

269
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,720
so this boils down to so now what we

270
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,320
want to do we want to do two sum checks

271
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:09,839
first some check that VI I +1 star is

272
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,759
equal to sum f i + one and we call them

273
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,759
star so we have

274
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,680
Z let me call this now uh we call the Z

275
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:24,000
Star okay Z one

276
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:27,360
star and P W1 W2 but we have another one

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,720
VI I +1

278
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:35,720
2 which is f i +1 V2

279
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,720
star

280
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:46,320
sum P W1 W2 P W1 W2 so now we need to

281
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,320
prove

282
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,600
this we have two

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
subjects okay and note it's not even

284
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,040
it's even two subjects of of different

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,000
functions too this is with Z1 star and

286
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,680
and this is a Z2 star it's kind of a

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,680
little different the functions

288
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
yeah

289
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,199
fabulous exactly you got it that's it

290
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,759
it's as simple as that so what do we

291
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:23,600
do we so I'm saying do two

292
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,399
subjects how do I do two so won't it

293
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,399
grow to four no the simple trivial

294
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,360
observation do two subjects with the

295
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,319
same random from the

296
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,160
prover okay so the G says when you have

297
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,480
this do two Su

298
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
checks with

299
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,199
same

300
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,880
prover Randomness uh verifier sorry

301
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,880
sorry

302
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,759
verifier

303
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,639
Randomness so at the end what do we have

304
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:02,399
if we is the same Randomness we need to

305
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:05,360
it reduces to verifying f i +1 Z1 star

306
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,600
and some Randomness from the verifier

307
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,720
which uh we let me call it uh I'll call

308
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:16,199
it again z0 Z1

309
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:23,639
Z2 it's fresh and also he needs to check

310
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:23,639
f i +1 Z two star on z0 Z1

311
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,279
Z2 how does he check them what is this F

312
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,959
let's go back

313
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,319
we have all this is the F right like the

314
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,600
the the all this so we said look and til

315
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:42,240
the door wor he can do on his

316
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,720
own Mt till they can do on his own what

317
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,680
does he need from the verifier and sorry

318
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,959
and this Kai he can do on his own what

319
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:56,120
does he actually need from the from the

320
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:58,519
prover what he needs from the Prov is v+

321
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,480
One V plus two Tilda because we're going

322
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,519
one left

323
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,439
on

324
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,600
Z1 and on Z2 but it's the same Z1 and Z2

325
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,839
in

326
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,760
both so all he needs from the from the

327
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,679
prover is the value of V Tilda and Z1

328
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,679
and Z2 and he's

329
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,000
done so yeah two two values we started

330
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:29,799
with two we ended with two that's it you

331
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,799
continue like this all the way down so

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,760
so to summarize how does the what is the

333
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:43,200
gkr protocol it's just a bunch of two

334
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,280
subjects in parallel D of them that's

335
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,240
all that's what we do okay and in the

336
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,200
middle the prover gives information the

337
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,640
prover needs to give the Vil does to

338
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:57,600
help him out but that's it yes you need

339
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,039
to like inter the you do it in parallel

340
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,400
yes it's very important good good

341
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,360
observation game it's very important

342
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,679
that when you do when you go from layer

343
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,679
I to layer I + one the two subjects are

344
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,480
done in parallel if you do it

345
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,600
sequentially then now the second subject

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,720
you know the coin so you can cheat okay

347
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,000
but you do two subject so you do so

348
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,159
here's the GK protocol you start with

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Alpha

350
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,640
layer you do two so okay Al lay two some

351
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
check but it's just one it's for the

352
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
same thing so you can think of as just

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
one sum check so you do the sum check

354
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,360
twice for the the sake of it but really

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,120
one you do some check you reduce two so

356
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,640
you do the two Su checks it reduces to

357
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,720
two values in

358
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,200
layer i+ one but not just it reduces it

359
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,200
reduces to a point here which you can

360
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,000
compute from two from two values in

361
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,799
layer one one below so so I asked the

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,400
provs give me the two values he must

363
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,520
cheat if he I mean if he cheated

364
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,919
originally he must continue to cheat so

365
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,360
I have two values and then I do another

366
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,120
sum check with the same Randomness same

367
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,679
exact Randomness so I do a sum check I

368
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,360
go one layer

369
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,919
below I again I I need to check I get a

370
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
value of f but two values of f to check

371
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,600
them I need to ask the ver the prover

372
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,559
give me two values on this layer I plus

373
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,240
two below I get these two values by

374
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,320
soundless of the sum check they must

375
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,039
what they should not be correct and then

376
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,360
I do another Su check another check

377
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,600
another until I reach the leaves the the

378
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,320
input once I I reach the input what what

379
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
what did they give me gave me a point in

380
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,440
the low degree extension of my input

381
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,520
that I can compute in linear time it's

382
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,799
just a sum of weighted sum over my input

383
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,600
values so I just computed on my

384
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,840
own that's it that's the

385
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,120
protocol okay so it's really just two

386
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,000
subjects in parallel with same

387
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,400
Randomness prover sends two values in

388
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,039
the low degree extension of next layer

389
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,080
two SS represent two values two

390
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,520
s that's the

391
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,960
protocol yeah so those are not the

392
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,840
same you're saying the same with each

393
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,400
other not the same as yeah exactly yeah

394
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,080
yeah yeah these These are actually per

395
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,679
layer right this is like i+ one this is

396
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,320
like I you know yeah it's exactly so

397
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,840
they're they're the same for I but in

398
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,840
different eyes they have different uh in

399
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,640
different layers you choose the

400
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,320
randomness fresh yes thank you yeah

401
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:36,280
any like has security proof of like the

402
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,000
parallel version that's does it just

403
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,000
come

404
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
from

405
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,840
Yeahs good let so let's do the security

406
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,760
proof I'm trying to think what's the

407
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:55,799
best to eras here I'll eras this okay so

408
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,360
let's do the security proof the

409
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:01,159
soundless so first I guess the the um

410
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,880
the completeness really follows from the

411
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,640
completeness from the sum check like if

412
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,240
you do things correctly the sum check

413
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,240
should work you just get the complet is

414
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,279
pretty trivial the uh complexity why

415
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,600
like the

416
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,120
complexity uh we'll do the sound in a

417
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,520
minute let's first do the complexity so

418
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,960
what are we doing we're

419
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,159
doing two subjects per layer we have D

420
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,320
layers so we run in time uh so okay

421
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,960
let's first do the the complexity so so

422
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:37,200
what is the uh communication

423
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:40,200
complexity so we do D pairs of subject

424
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,679
protocol so I already run in d what is

425
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,919
the communication complexity of each

426
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,880
subject

427
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:50,320
protocol number of variables degree and

428
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:53,600
log F number of variable is 3 m order

429
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:57,520
M the degree is H minus one or but the

430
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,440
oh I just erased okay uh so the depth

431
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,520
the number of variables like log s over

432
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,840
log log s the degree is log s so

433
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,840
everything is like Po log

434
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,600
s so we don't need o uh and times the

435
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:19,240
log F we will take F to be polog s2o so

436
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,200
everything is D times polog s okay so

437
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,279
I'll put it aside we'll take F Well it

438
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,279
can be very big but it will be poly logs

439
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:36,320
okay that's the the field okay ah

440
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:41,320
sorry it's log it's um

441
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,760
poas yeah so log is log yeah log is p

442
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,799
logs

443
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:51,120
okay a great so uh this is communication

444
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,120
complexity what about the verifier onun

445
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:58,600
time so of course he does the com he

446
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,240
does the

447
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,400
so in the care all he does a bunch of

448
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,279
some Che protocols so he just sends

449
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,799
Randomness and does whatever uh you know

450
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:12,640
uh does these I guess the the the

451
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:15,279
runtime of the of the Su protocol and

452
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,520
then he gets at each time two elements

453
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,240
from the approver and he just needs to

454
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,799
check like consistency of this F right

455
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,320
he all assuming he has till and M as an

456
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,640
oracle the only thing he checks is like

457
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,559
that this times this plus this is equals

458
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,679
some value so that's just a bunch of

459
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,960
field elements it's nothing uh so really

460
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,320
it's it's the same as this not much more

461
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,159
and what does the prover do the prover

462
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,559
just does a bunch of su checks but the

463
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:49,159
Su so the prover run

464
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:51,679
time well he does d sum checks or 2D but

465
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,120
will do a lot of order times the number

466
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,600
of VAR variables M which is uh less than

467
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,880
log s time H to the m which is s so

468
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,559
already he's like poly s so the D

469
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,440
doesn't matter actually essentially be

470
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,640
polys because the D is polys H to them

471
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,200
is polys and the time to compute he also

472
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,240
runs in the time to compute this

473
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,799
polinomial this kind of function but the

474
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,640
time to compute this is also like poly

475
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,679
and H to the m because each one of them

476
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,600
is like sum of H to them terms times

477
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,360
like a very simple polinomial that kind

478
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
of the low degree extension so overall

479
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,200
he runs in time poly

480
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,679
so really so this is what you get and

481
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,679
this is what we

482
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,320
wanted

483
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,919
okay so the verifier runs in time D the

484
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,000
number of some check time poly log s

485
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,799
because each time he does something very

486
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,120
very

487
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,039
small okay so let's talk about the the

488
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,120
soundness that's kind of the interesting

489
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,120
part okay so for

490
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,000
soundness the soundness analysis goes as

491
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,640
follows it says

492
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,760
if the prover

493
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,440
cheated there they successfully cheated

494
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,240
so he lied but we accepted him we want

495
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,200
to argue that this happens with a small

496
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,039
probability so for this to happen and

497
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,600
there must exist a layer when he went

498
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:17,880
from a false claim to a true claim

499
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,440
because at the end he gave us a true

500
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,799
claim because I'm checking in the

501
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,039
beginning he gave me a false claim so

502
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:28,320
somewhere I had to go from false to to

503
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:32,520
true so let me I want to look at the not

504
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:38,919
notation so I won't mess it up this time

505
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,919
um okay so so here's the the sound

506
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:48,520
is so let's denote so so

507
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,640
suppose we have a cheating

508
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,640
prover that cheats with probability

509
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,559
Epsilon and then we'll see also what

510
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,799
thaton is kind of what's the best

511
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,360
probability you can Cho

512
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,520
so suppose there's a p star that cheats

513
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,000
with probability

514
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,600
Epsilon so cheats meaning he gives me a

515
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,399
false statement but I accept

516
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,600
him then I'm looking um okay so then for

517
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:19,240
every

518
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,240
actually a okay uh for every I in

519
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,840
D I want to denote the randomness that

520
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,919
was used by the sum Che by the two

521
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,919
parallel sum Che protocols let's denote

522
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,520
by z i0 z

523
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,520
i1 and Z

524
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,960
I2 the randomness

525
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,919
use of

526
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,919
v in the I some check

527
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,919
protocol in the two kind of parallel use

528
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,880
the same Randomness so let's just Den

529
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,480
know by Z i0 that's kind of the z0 Z1 Z2

530
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,590
but in each layer it's different okay

531
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,320
now

532
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,760
[Music]

533
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,960
um and okay and let's denote the

534
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,720
resulting

535
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,000
claim so

536
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:25,159
denote resulting claim of the after the

537
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,159
the I uh

538
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:41,600
by a VI Tilda and Z i1 equals V

539
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,679
i1 and VI Tilda on

540
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,799
Z

541
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,840
I2 equals

542
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,159
vi2 okay so this is kind of the the

543
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,919
claim the what the verifier sends me

544
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,760
after the Su protocol okay so I the Su

545
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:01,000
protocol I gave him a bunch of z z i z z

546
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,080
i1 I2 this is in the I kind of pairs of

547
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,080
some protocol and then I can't comp then

548
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,480
he for the next layer he gives me kind

549
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:14,679
of the values okay so uh

550
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:18,519
uh so this is just notation so with this

551
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:21,279
notation what does it mean for for the

552
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,880
prover to cheat so let's denote by kind

553
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,480
of a bad event bi the EV so I'm going to

554
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,159
not by bi for bad the event that that in

555
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,120
round I minus one he cheat he was he was

556
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,600
faulty Nam gave me cheat but

557
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,360
miraculously in round I everything is

558
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,760
fine okay so Den note by

559
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,760
bi is the

560
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:55,440
event that what

561
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:58,720
that in round IUS one vi v IUS one uh on

562
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,799
z i IUS one one

563
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,799
either this is not

564
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,559
true

565
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,880
or VI I minus or the other one is not

566
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,880
true so one of them is not

567
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,760
true so bad is the event that in round I

568
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,720
minus one at least one of the claim is

569
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,080
false but in round I and in round I both

570
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,399
of them are true miraculously

571
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,919
this is also an

572
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:39,559
equal and VI and

573
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,559
Z2 is equal to

574
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:49,000
vi2 note that if the Prov cheated it

575
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,600
must be the case that the probability so

576
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,120
because the pro cheated with probability

577
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:59,120
Epsilon by our assumption it must be the

578
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,120
case that B1 or or BD

579
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,640
is at least Epsilon because he CHS with

580
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,279
probity Epsilon so the pro Epsilon he

581
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:10,519
starts with false and gets to

582
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:12,559
true so either the you know he already

583
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,720
got to True after round two like after

584
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,480
the first one or someone went to true so

585
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,440
one of the bees must hold one of the bad

586
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,080
event must happen for him to

587
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,600
cheat but so okay let me denote the

588
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,600
Epsilon here

589
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,159
but by Union bound this is just sum on D

590
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:37,159
of probability of

591
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,799
bi okay so we know that he can cheat

592
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,960
with probability and with probability

593
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,360
and most some of the probability of bad

594
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,519
on

595
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,159
I now what does it bad so you know let's

596
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,519
look at probability of bad and I so let

597
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,880
me actually even this there's two types

598
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,440
of bad eye there's bad eye where this is

599
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,360
bad bad eye zero and or bad eye one and

600
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,880
bad ey two where this is bad okay so I'm

601
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,639
just let me denote this by some and uh I

602
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,639
and D

603
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,760
sorry the

604
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:26,279
probability so this is just notation I

605
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:32,039
want to call this b i0 or bi

606
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:36,480
i1 or B B I2 so let me Define bi

607
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:39,960
i1 is that bad where this is bad

608
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:45,440
where this is kind the the one is bad so

609
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:48,919
this means that VI IUS one Z IUS one one

610
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,120
is bad it's not like it was false and

611
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,279
this means that two was false okay so B

612
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,919
says one of them was false let's

613
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,519
partition it either the first was false

614
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:02,039
or the second now maybe both it's a I

615
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,399
said or okay but I know one of them is

616
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,559
false now I'm going to Union bound so

617
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,159
I'm going to say again this is equal to

618
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:14,639
sum on I and

619
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:16,240
D sum on B in one or

620
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:20,360
two

621
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,360
probability of b

622
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,600
i now let's look what is the probability

623
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,840
of bi what is this bad event bi it's

624
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,519
let's think of bi for one for Simplicity

625
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,360
this is

626
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,360
false but the layer below is

627
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,600
true if this is false and the layer

628
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,480
below is true it means that he cheated

629
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,519
in the subject protocol this is exactly

630
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,480
means he cheting subject protocol

631
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,679
because he managed to start with the

632
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,279
false claim of the subject protocol and

633
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:59,720
get you to a true claim and the kind of

634
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,840
at the you know at at at the F at the

635
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,159
like at the

636
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,480
bottom because if if he didn't give you

637
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,480
a true claim if he gave here true you

638
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,720
would you would uh you wouldn't accept

639
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,159
him you would actually call him out so

640
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,320
if you accepted him when he gave you a

641
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,679
true claim in I it must mean that he

642
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,159
cheated in the I and that subject

643
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,159
protocol

644
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:29,760
yeah oh sorry yes yeah sorry

645
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,279
a union bound everything is small equal

646
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,840
thank

647
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:39,200
you

648
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,519
uh oh sorry this is equal this is

649
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,080
definition yeah yeah this is just

650
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,080
definition

651
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:52,559
yeah okay yeah so B i1 okay so let me bi

652
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,399
is the event that this or this and both

653
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,240
of this bi1 is just the EV that this is

654
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:03,440
false and this bi is the event that this

655
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:07,760
is false oh and

656
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:11,720
this okay exactly so that is the bi is

657
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,520
the event that in in layer I minus one

658
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:17,320
one of the answers is false but in layer

659
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:21,839
I both are true that's

660
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:23,240
bi bi1 I'm partitioning into two bi1 is

661
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,200
that actually it's the first claim

662
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,720
that's false and the next layer is true

663
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,240
bi2 is that the second claim was false

664
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,599
and the layer below is

665
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,919
true so I'm kind of partitioning the two

666
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,639
there's two subject protocols I'm saying

667
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,720
we said look you cheated in one of them

668
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,399
either you cheated in this one or you

669
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,399
cheated in this

670
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:48,560
one okay so bi1 said you cheated in the

671
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,879
first subject protocol because this was

672
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,800
false and you managed to get it true for

673
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,320
some

674
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,919
reason bi2 says you cheated in the

675
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,079
second subject protocol you started with

676
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:00,079
false and you got

677
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,200
true so going back to the question about

678
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,079
okay let let me just finish this so

679
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,880
what's the probability of cheating in

680
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,680
the sum check protocol well we have it m

681
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,960
* D divided by f m is less than log s uh

682
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,320
D is less than log s so let's say log

683
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,320
squ

684
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,079
s divided by f

685
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,599
so really the probability you cheat

686
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,119
Epsilon is smaller than log squ F

687
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,560
divided s log squ f is just kind of M *

688
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:43,000
D for us because m is like log s over

689
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,839
log log s uh D is H minus one which is

690
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,280
log s so essentially log squ s over s so

691
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:53,800
as long as you take F to be to be oh

692
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,960
sorry a yeah yeah so as long as you you

693
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:01,000
take F to be significant so now just

694
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,599
take F to be you pay with poly log F in

695
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,880
the communication and everything so take

696
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,920
a big F and you're

697
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,599
good now about the comment of like isn't

698
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,760
it dangerous that we use the same

699
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,200
Randomness for two some

700
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,640
protocols it's not dangerous and the

701
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,560
reason it's not dangerous because we're

702
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,240
doing a union bound the point is we're

703
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,839
doing a some two subject protocols but

704
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,040
actually we don't look let's forget that

705
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,079
you we're doing with you another I don't

706
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,520
care let's just look at one of them

707
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,599
we know that on this you can't cheat

708
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,160
even if you're doing a lot of other

709
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,480
things on the side on this we can't

710
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,200
cheat and we know that on this you can't

711
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
now you may it may be correlated I don't

712
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,680
care it may be that you cheat on one if

713
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,760
and only if you cheat on the other the

714
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,079
fact that you cheat on one is good

715
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,079
enough for me I don't so the union bound

716
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,800
kind of takes care of of of the fact

717
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,800
that we use the same

718
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,319
Randomness questions yeah the is it is

719
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,640
the gkr applying in like a black box way

720
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:01,560
exactly so G KR uses the Su protocol

721
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,079
completely in a blackbox way you don't

722
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,760
need to ever open the bo to know how it

723
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,760
works

724
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,760
so okay yeah exactly so I'll tell you

725
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,680
what you need about the sum protocol the

726
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,480
the one property you need so you can use

727
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,400
any quote unquote subject protocol as

728
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,760
long as it has the following property

729
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:26,240
the property is that the protocol is

730
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,480
public coin namely the verifi the the uh

731
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,160
the actually that even doesn't matter

732
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,560
let me even the verifier sends some

733
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,960
Randomness let's call it T1 to TM I

734
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,920
don't care what else he sends actually

735
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,680
whatever but at the end of the day it

736
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,839
reducing it reduces to the verifier

737
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,200
needs to check F and T1 of to TM so the

738
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,640
only thing I'm really using about the

739
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,119
subject protocol beyond the the

740
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,119
guarantees is the fact that at the end

741
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,760
of the day the verifier checks F on

742
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:00,480
random points generated by him

743
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,119
because that is what allows me to do the

744
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,720
two uh the two sucks in in in parallel

745
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,560
and as I said by the way in the original

746
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,839
gkr we didn't need that we could use any

747
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,359
some check because we we actually didn't

748
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:13,599
do two gkrs there was kind of a two to

749
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,960
one trick that went in there but the way

750
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,680
I presented it here which is simpler we

751
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,200
need the property we need about the sum

752
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,119
check is that the protocol T is that at

753
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:26,359
the end it reduces to verifying a single

754
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:29,359
point of that of the verifiers choosing

755
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:33,839
yeah um what happens at the very end

756
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:37,040
when you like get theay good how do you

757
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,359
define oh okay so the okay so the okay

758
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,800
so what happens in the input layer in

759
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,760
the input layer at the end the verifier

760
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,160
needs to

761
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,960
compute oh okay uh and the verifier

762
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,760
needs to

763
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,440
compute like VD which is the input layer

764
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:01,920
on uh I don't know

765
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:05,200
zd1 is it's kind that equals vd1

766
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,480
and VD and

767
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,280
zd2 is equal to vd2 he needs to check

768
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,400
this so the verifier will check this how

769
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,560
will he check it oh he can check that on

770
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,839
his own why let's see how long does it

771
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,680
take to check this let me see where the

772
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,839
low degree extension is buried okay

773
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,839
let's see what is the low degree

774
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,119
Computing the the low degree extension

775
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:32,839
he knows the uh so

776
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,839
V this is low degree

777
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,480
extension of X1 up to xn it's just

778
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,079
extension of the input that's all so n

779
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,680
is small n is small n is much smaller

780
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,440
than than than S yeah so n is very very

781
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,160
small much smaller than of course the

782
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,280
pro look the verifier needs to read the

783
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,720
input he needs to run time end he needs

784
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,800
to know what he's verifying so he reads

785
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,079
the input n you should think of it is

786
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,160
much smaller than S otherwise there's no

787
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,480
point in all this and to to check this

788
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,200
to check a point in the Lo of extension

789
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,560
of X takes time linear in N times

790
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,839
polylog in the field so quasy linear in

791
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:22,319
N because to check the sum the to check

792
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,160
load of the extension you just take the

793
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,240
only n of them because you're doing

794
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,720
something over n you can Pat it by zeros

795
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,839
to get as as you want but there's only n

796
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,960
nonzero FS here so you're doing sum of N

797
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,440
elements X1 of to xn and each one times

798
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,079
this small polinomial that you can

799
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,240
compute that's a polylog computation

800
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,920
needy variables for

801
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,160
cut exactly you just set them up to zero

802
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,280
yeah

803
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,880
exactly yeah actually in the original

804
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,440
paper the way the notations work is more

805
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,240
complicated because we didn't set them

806
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,760
all to zero so we had another s and but

807
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,200
setting all to zero is just simple

808
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,200
because you have less notation

809
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,760
other

810
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,760
questions

811
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,960
yeah1 do they come from like the fan in

812
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,800
two like are like left inputs and right

813
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,720
inputs or no uh no okay the fan in two

814
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,400
came from the fact that add here has

815
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,119
only three things it's like the input

816
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,160
and two output like P is the gate above

817
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:25,119
and it only has two children that's the

818
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,480
fan in two otherwise you'll have many

819
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,520
the the way the reason okay yes the

820
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,079
answer is yes actually because

821
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,640
the yeah okay yeah sorry yes because

822
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,480
because they have only fan in two

823
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,160
there's only otherwise you'll have like

824
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,880
vw1 plus vw2 plus VW3 plus vw4 yes sorry

825
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,599
I did no no so if you had a higher fan

826
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,640
yeah with lower dep could you do just

827
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,760
more some checks lower yeah yeah yeah

828
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,160
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you can okay

829
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,560
good point okay Leo has a very good

830
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,040
point what Le was saying he's saying

831
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,680
look you assumed fan in two but you paid

832
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,839
for it in Another Log number of rounds

833
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,680
uh don't assume it just don't have F to

834
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,920
have p and many children W1 up to W

835
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,240
whatever uh but then uh reduce it to

836
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,079
more true but you can't have too big fan

837
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,280
because you're going to pay for it in

838
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,680
the communication complexity and

839
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,400
everything so as long as it's most kind

840
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,240
of poly log you're okay so it's yeah

841
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,599
yeah but you're right you don't there's

842
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,160
no magic about

843
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,520
two okay we're out of time thank you so

844
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:31,079
much and uh enjoy your break next week

845
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,079
for some reason your holiday what
